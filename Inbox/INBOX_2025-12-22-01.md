Notes - New Ventures: PA Resource Alignment  

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1irRq_cPUc7eU6WXBHtBFiKh53SfPf7H8M7nDeVzn_yE/edit



Hey folks, Meeting goal: Align on the guidance on the scope of the local PA  

teams working with the respective brands/tribes. Context: This is a  

follow-up on a discussion we just had within TPT based on we feel we need  

to align on how the local PA teams will be working with the respective  

brands/tribes - It seems that on one hand we're saying that the local teams  

work on the team backlog (e.g. Shopping Foundations + New Ventures) and on  

the other hand we're saying that the majority (if not all) capacity is  

dedicated to centralized cross-brands work (e.g. success KPI tracking  

etc.) Let's reinforce the message of the function of the central BI and  

Reporting team that will be focused on visualizations; how do the tribes  

work with that team in case of issues, breaks or customizations (e.g. the  

TPT funnel).
