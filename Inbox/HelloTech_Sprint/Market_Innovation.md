N/A

### Delivered (This Sprint)
1. GC NL -> HF Migration: Migration foundation (backend)
- Built and validated core migration tooling to move active GC customers to HF, including payment tokens, subscription preferences, and entitlements.
- Prepared production-ready migration branches to support phased rollout.

2. GC NL -> HF Migration: Communicaiton ((FE web/mobile)
- Shipped customer-facing CTAs across web and mobile to inform customers of:
  - GC closure
  - HF as the new destination
  - The new HF premium plan offering
- Ensured customers are guided through the transition at key decision points.

3. Initial rollout readiness
Finalized the first migration batch scheduled for Feb 5, targeting ~27% of GC customers, as a planned initial rollout.

### Planned (Next Sprint)
1. Execute remaining (NL) GC → HF migration batches in W7, completing the planned rollout beyond the initial Feb 5 branch.

2. Launch price comparison experience for GC customers to clearly communicate value and pricing differences, improving conversion and confidence.

3. Scale migration tooling to support remaining 4,260 GC NL customers (73%).

### Key Learnings
1. Migration tooling is foundational infrastructure, not a one-off task
- Investing early enables safer market transitions, faster rollouts, and reduced customer and revenue risk.

2. Customer-facing clarity is as critical as backend correctness
- Migration success depends on aligned backend logic and frontend/mobile UX, especially during product sunsets.

3. Phased rollouts reduce risk and increase confidence
- Starting with a meaningful first batch (27%) provides strong signal before scaling remaining migrations, and ensures customer communication (eg email) is delivered.
