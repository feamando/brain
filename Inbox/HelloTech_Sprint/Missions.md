### Squad KPI
Weekly Loyalty Engaged User Rate

### KPI Movement
Target : 12%
Actual : 5.83% (src)*

* We are currently reporting this data for Loyalty 1.0 from US, as Loyalty 2.0 is still under development

### Delivered (This Sprint)
We are working toward launching the MVP test of  our "Loyalty 2.0" program for HelloFresh US in March. The below deliverables are slated for release in February as a part of milestone 1 (Internal Launch - Friends & Family) of the new program.

1. Established the connection between internal systems (CAS) and the points engine (Talon One), enabling core point processing.
2. Integrated frontend clients with Loyalty API v3 to enable program opt-in and checking a customer's enrolment status and program version.
3. Delivered the new "Rewards Cards" UI, allowing customers to view available rewards in the Loyalty Program.

### Planned (Next Sprint)
1. Enable customers enrolled in the Loyalty 2.0 program to earn points based on their spend via Talon One and view their points balance in the Loyalty Dashboard.

### Key Learnings
1. In the ongoing Factor Rewards experiment in the US, both variants of the experiment are showing a lower weekly cancellation rate. Food-based rewards are leading with a 2.6% lower cancellation rate, versus monetary rewards showing a 2.4% lower cancellation rate when compared to the control group. Based on these early directional trends, we are diving deeper into the data to check if it’s feasible to make an early decision on the rollout of the Factor Rewards Program in the US.
