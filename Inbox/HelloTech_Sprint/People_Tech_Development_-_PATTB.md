## People Tech Development - PATTB
**Tribe:** Global People Technology
**Mega-Alliance:** Ops

### Squad KPI
# of Distribution Centres using Workday Absence & Time Tracking

### KPI Movement
Fresh Field programme: Readiness improved versus last sprint, but overall delivery risk increased due to late-breaking requirements

### Delivered (This Sprint)
Fresh Field programme advanced across testing and operational readiness; ORT mobilisation initiated with onsite sessions confirmed; clock testing progressed with logistics unblocked; 16/17 SSC SOPs completed; Wave 2 kick-off initiated

### Planned (Next Sprint)
Execute ORT and DACH onsite testing; close open configuration items; stabilise readiness for UK and DACH go-lives; continue Wave 2 discovery

### Key Learnings
Operational readiness, not build progress, is now the critical path; late scope additions materially compress stabilisation time
