### Key Learnings
1. Early vendor outreach requires strict gating and consistent messaging to avoid unmanaged pre-screening conversations.
2. We need full visibility into vendor communications from IP to properly manage Q&A and timelines.
3. Contributors and informed parties are highly engaged, so a centralized FAQ and communication protocol reduces noise and ensures fairness in the process.
