### Squad KPI
Users that have successfully saved at least 3 recipes to their Cookbook

(swarming with Inspire squad on a Q1 MBL item)

### KPI Movement
Target: 1M (Q1)
Actual: 6.7K
Compared to Last Month: +5.2k (from 1.5k to 6.7k)

### Delivered (This Sprint)
1. Aisle-Based Grocery View: Organizes recipe ingredients by store aisle to create a more intuitive, streamlined "grocery" shopping experience.
2. Dynamic Serving Adjustments: Enables users to scale serving sizes before adding ingredients to their grocery list, ensuring accurate quantities.

### Planned (Next Sprint)
1. [swarming with Inspire squad] Allow app users to share the Cookbook feature and/or saved recipes, creating a new viral growth loop
2. Finish work in progress to launch an A/B test of the Post-Cutoff Meal Planner, which allows subscribers to schedule which days they're going to cook each of their meal kits on during the upcoming week.

### Key Learnings
- Strong Initial Interest vs. Low Utility: While the feature successfully attracted 37K users (top-of-funnel), only 10% converted to active users (adding items), indicating a significant gap between "interest" and "functional value."
- The "View-Only" Barrier: A 90% drop-off from viewing to adding items suggests the current UI/UX feels more like a static reference page than an interactive tool.
- Low Feature "Ownership": With <1% manual additions, customers view this strictly as a "HelloFresh Ingredient Summary" rather than a personal shopping list. This limits the feature’s stickiness and daily relevance.
- Broken Feedback Loop: The 2.87% check-off rate is the primary concern. It indicates that even active users are not using the list during the "action" phase (shopping ), meaning the tool currently fails to provide its main utility.
- Content Drivers: Growth is driven by the Recipe Hub (66%) rather than the Cookbook, suggesting users are using the list to "shortlist" or "bookmark" future meals they desire.
