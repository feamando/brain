## Campaign Composition
**Tribe:** Communications
**Mega-Alliance:** Growth
**Squad Lead:** Aamish Baluch, Emmanuel S.D

### Squad KPI
% of campaigns migrated to Iterable

### KPI Movement
0%/100%

### Delivered (This Sprint)
- CRM can now launch campaigns in Iterable with all foundational work done, including code snippets (merge tags) and Knak templates sync, soft login, and discount communication.

### Planned (Next Sprint)
- Launch RAF Cart Abandonment campaign for HF in Iterable.
- Complete and test the Forgot Password transactional campaign setup so it is ready to launch.

### Key Learnings
- Owning delivery from foundations and configuration through campaign creation and testing enabled the squad to ship launch-ready outcomes within a single sprint, avoiding handoffs and delays.
- Testing foundations through real, launch-ready campaigns surfaced gaps early and ensured solutions directly support business-critical use cases.
- Early, focused collaboration with the Consumer Core team (owner of CIPS) via a lightweight RFC and dev-to-dev sync enabled fast validation and allowed Comms to deliver end-to-end without handoff delays.
- AI support helped engineers work effectively in unfamiliar codebases, reducing ramp-up time and maintaining delivery speed across team boundaries.
