## Cart
**Tribe:** Shopping Foundation
**Mega-Alliance:** Consumer
**Squad Lead:** EM: (A-Dos) Arbaaz Dossani (Temp for Tales Padua on Pat. Leave)
PM: Xavier Sinclair Vale-Buisson

### Squad KPI
Cart Service Adoption Rate

### KPI Movement
Target: 100%
Actual: 58.2%
Movement: 23.2%

### Delivered (This Sprint)
Global Cart Service Migration: Continued the architectural migration of the Cart Service to its own authoritative data layer, successfully rolling out across remaining European and AU/NZ markets. This refactor enables faster meal selection and eliminates potential data errors for our customers.

### Planned (Next Sprint)
1. Complete Cart Service roll out to all remaining markets (YE still pending meal-plan handler fix)
2. Release Cart Read API across all markets 
3. Release Post-lock change for P500 use, which will allow local markets to switch recipes without sending manual requests to the Cart squad

### Key Learnings
1. Load testing for save requests not just reading  in the future
2. Support engineer process to be reviewed to deal with high number of requests
