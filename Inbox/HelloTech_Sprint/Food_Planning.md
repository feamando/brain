### Squad KPI
Weekly Offering (Menu) Task Automation Rate (%)

### KPI Movement
KPI Target still being defined, for this new squad.

### Delivered (This Sprint)
[xPS Data Validation that catches errors before it reaches to customers]
1. Laid the foundation for a new validation service to improve data quality at scale
2. Enabled the launch of an automated validation service to catch menu and content issues earlier, reducing manual effort and preventing downstream operational errors as menu volume grows.

[P500 Availability Management System]
1. Enabled SKU caps with automatic “Sold Out” triggering feature for users to do UAT
2. Page load times improved from ~20s to ~2s to support better usability and adoption.

[KTLO & Continuous Improvements]
1. Improved CCM Menu performance by reducing the menu save response times 
2. Introduced performance tracking editor productivity, giving the squad clear KPIs to monitor and optimize performance.

### Planned (Next Sprint)
[xPS Data Validation that catches errors before it reaches to customers]
1. Enable automated and scheduled checks to catch menu and content issues earlier, expand business rule coverage, and reduce manual reviews and downstream operational errors.
2. Improve system observability to speed up issue detection to allow faster, more accurate investigations, minimizing disruption to operational teams.

[P500 Availability Management System]
1. Complete Availability Management for UAT and rollout by finalizing end-to-end readiness of Availability Management, enabling UAT and rollout for W12 to reduce sold-out issues, manual work in managing availability and improve customer experience.

[KTLO & Continuous Improvements]
1. Further reduce CCM response times to improve editor efficiency by delivering targeted performance improvements to make menu creation and updates faster and more reliable.

### Key Learnings
1. Insights on validation enhancements  alerts needed to effectively detect data discrepancies and gaps in proactive manner.
2. Current logging, tracing infrastructure is "leaky" making the investigations more difficult than it should be.
3. Along with functional tests, data tests help in measuring the success of the system behaviour.
