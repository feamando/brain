## Merchandising & Shopping Guidance
**Tribe:** Shopping Journey
**Mega-Alliance:** Consumer
**Squad Lead:** EM: Shruti Patil
PM: Laura Mneimneh

### Squad KPI
Net AOV proven from experiments

### KPI Movement
No movement - development on experiment targeting AOV will start this sprint

### Delivered (This Sprint)
1.  Implementation of New Order Cards variation 2
2.  UI2 readiness for ChefsPlate on Android

### Planned (Next Sprint)
1. Homepage Experiment launch
2. Chefsplate Elysium launch 
3. Extra meal price communication in the Shopping Guidance (for AOV)

### Key Learnings
- we discovered issues on small screens with the quick action pills on the homepage variation 2 and updated the logic for them to have a dynamic width so that they don't wrap on 2 lines when the number of characters is long
