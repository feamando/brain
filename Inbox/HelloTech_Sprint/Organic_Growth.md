### Key Learnings
Removing duplicate recipe pages across Phase 2 markets (US, GB, DE, CA, NZ) using 301 redirects and canonical/noindex consolidation can meaningfully improve organic performance. By comparing pre- and post-deduplication results and benchmarking against last year’s seasonal trends and control pages, we learned that cleaning up duplicate content drives measurable gains in traffic and efficiency. Careful testing against non-recipe pages helps confirm that the improvements are real and not seasonal.
