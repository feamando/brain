## Logistics
**Tribe:** n/a, RFI phase
**Mega-Alliance:** Ops

### KPI Movement
Last Mile Tech

### Delivered (Last Sprint)
PM - Lauren Tersaga
SL - N/A

### Planned (Next Sprint)
% of all global markets onboarded to Final Mile & Routing platform

### Key Learnings
1. Begin structured Q&A cycles with vendors; consolidate questions and responses
2. Hold vendor clarification calls as required (routing + execution)
3. Build shared FAQ tracking for all vendors (internal + external)
4. Start preparing for evaluation rubric customization based on vendor responses
5. Continue TIS KTLO as needed

**MBL Initiative:** 1. Distributed Highlander Final Mile Tooling RFI to vendors and began Q&A (20%)
2. TIS KTLO and data cleanup (20%)
3. Evaluated additional Final Mile Tooling vendors in response to RFI (10%)
4. Supported Amazon Key launch in US HFDN (10%)
5. Supported integration of US HFDN and Dropoff DSP (10%)
6. Solutioned TIS sideloading build for failures in response to winter storm (10%)
6. FarEye KTLO, enhancements, change requests (10%)
7. Revenue recognition logic refinement in partnership with Global Finance (10%)

**Sprint Health:** 1. Early vendor outreach requires strict gating and consistent messaging to avoid unmanaged pre-screening conversations.
2. We need full visibility into vendor communications from IP to properly manage Q&A and timelines.
3. Contributors and informed parties are highly engaged, so a centralized FAQ and communication protocol reduces noise and ensures fairness in the process.
