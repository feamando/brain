## EXAMPLE: Feedback
**Tribe:** EXAMPLE: Shopping Journey
**Mega-Alliance:** Consumer

### Squad KPI
EXAMPLE: Recipe Response Rate

### KPI Movement
EXAMPLE: 
Target: 16.0%
Actual: 17.5%
Compared to Last Month: + 2.5% (from 15.0% to 17.5%)

### Delivered (This Sprint)
EXAMPLE: 
1. Launched v2 of the in-app micro-survey for recipe rating/feedback on the post-cook screen. 
2. Integrated feedback data stream with the Core Product database.

### Planned (Next Sprint)
EXAMPLE: 
1. Implement personalized push notifications to prompt feedback 30 minutes after the estimated meal completion time. 
2. Begin A/B testing different visual styles for the feedback UI.

### Key Learnings
1. The new micro-survey placement significantly boosted response rate (17.5% vs. 15.0% baseline), validating the shift away from email prompts.

2. The new data stream integration confirmed that 70% of responses occur within 15 minutes of app session re-entry, suggesting we can optimize push notification timing.
