## Strategic Procurement
**Tribe:** Ingredient to Product
**Mega-Alliance:** Ops
**Squad Lead:** PO : Imran Uddin
EM : Maykol Saavedra

### Squad KPI
Menu Risk (% of at-fault recipes flagged and resolved before T-3)

### KPI Movement
KPI definition and data completeness needs to be updated [part of sprint 3 goal]

### Delivered (This Sprint)
[P500 Substitutions Pre-Approved Ingridient Selection Flow]
1. Prepare AI SKU Substitution options for HF & EP - WK06/07/08/09 to reduce the friction for recipe developers to manually click on "generate AI recommendation" for each recipe.
2. Update Manual Substitution Edit Reasons to ensure we capture the reasons accurately for manually replacing an AI sub suggestion. In the long term this will help us improve the AI suggested
3. Removed all AI generated and/or manual subs after the ship without/pack without selection. The helps in ensuring the pack without/ ship without options serve as the ultimate rider in the sub decision log and all options generated thereof hold no importance for downstream services/users.

[KTLO & Continuous Improvements]
1. Improvements to the search and filter in the sku catalog. This increases the ease of navigation and filtering out the relevant jobs to be done for a recipe developer.

### Planned (Next Sprint)
[P500 Substitutions Pre-Approved Ingridient Selection Flow]
1. Enable "copy from" functionality for pre-approved SKU Subs between base, variants and versions of a recipe.
2. Complete one time migration of pre-approved SKU subs between identifed base, variants and versions of recipes.
3. Improved the subs UX by grouping base, variants and versions of a recipe in the UI.

[KTLO & Continuous Improvements]
1. Authenticate (3P FSQA tool that collects & store information) <> internal Supplier SKU integration improvements
2. Menu Risk Ratio (squad KPI) calculation improvements
