## Plan & Procurement
**Tribe:** W05: 1/1 in Arizona
W06: 1/1 in Arizona
**Mega-Alliance:** Ops

### KPI Movement
Globalization of Procurement Tooling

### Key Learnings
[P500 Substitutions Execution Flow]
We will focus on hypercare, continuous improvements tasks such as creating runbooks. We will  evaluate the team capacity and probably send 1 FE to support touchless ordering.

**MBL Initiative:** [P500 Substitutions Execution Flow]
We officially rolled out the in-week subs platform for Arizona and we created the first substitutions live. We also worked on some UX improvements to ease and fasten the ability for procurement to submit a sub. By the end of the sprint, we will consider the first version of the platform done.
