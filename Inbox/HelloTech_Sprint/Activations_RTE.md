## Activations RTE
**Tribe:** Conversions
**Mega-Alliance:** Growth
**Squad Lead:** EM: Ashwin Samtani
PM: Tommaso Cremonini

### Squad KPI
Incremental Gross Conversions (RTE)

### KPI Movement
n/a

### Delivered (This Sprint)
1. FJ redesigned flow test - 40%
2. P500 extension to HF US desktop - 30%
3. KTLO - 25%
4. HF Register page unification completion - 5%

### Planned (Next Sprint)
1. Go live of two experiments: (i) new redesigned FJ mobile Quiz expriment, (ii) P500 extension to HF US desktop
2. Kick off the work on the new dynamic FJ Quiz controlled by ML model
3. DIY for meal selection in activation funnel

### Key Learnings
The funnel is a highly stateful, experiment-heavy system where small UI or logic changes ripple across validation, tracking, pricing, and compliance. Changes like the Factor redesign and P500 desktop initiatives need to be handled patiently and deliberately to avoid cross-brand bleed or negative impacts in this highly sensitive TRE.
