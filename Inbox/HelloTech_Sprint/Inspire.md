## Inspire
**Tribe:** Customer Engagement
**Mega-Alliance:** Consumer
**Squad Lead:** EM: Edu Morôni
PM: Lisa Trueblood

### Squad KPI
Users that have successfully saved at least 3 recipes to their Cookbook

### KPI Movement
Target: 1M (Q1)
Actual: 6.7K
Compared to Last Month: +5.2k (from 1.5k to 6.7k)

### Delivered (This Sprint)
1. Launched a video-based awareness and activation flow that includes a full-screen takeover on app open and an onboarding video that plays when a user visits the Cookbook for the first time
2. Redesigned the empty version of the Cookbook screen to prompt users to save their first recipe and added a link to a picture-in-picture tutorial that runs in social media apps and teaches them how to save a recipe

### Planned (Next Sprint)
1. Allow app users to share the Cookbook feature and/or saved recipes, creating a new viral growth loop
2. Improve the experience of saving recipes to the Cookbook by providing clearer error communication during the import process for external recipes and allowing users to save HelloFresh recipes to their Cookbook from any entry point in the app, as-is

### Key Learnings
1. In UXR, we continue seeing signals that users connect with the problem of saving recipes across platforms. For example, “I need this so badly because I have so many recipes saved under every single social media.” (src)
2. However, very few app users are saving recipes to their Cookbook (dashboard). Total daily imports are decreasing, and the number of users who saved 3+ recipes is still below 10k. This is why we focused on awareness and onboarding the past 2 weeks. Starting from the next sprint, we will also swarm both squads in the tribe on driving Cookbook adoption.
3. We see an upward trend in the percentage of external recipes saved relative to HelloFresh recipes, but HelloFresh recipes still account for the vast majority (c.90%)
