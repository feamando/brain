### Delivered (Last Sprint)
N/A

### Planned (Next Sprint)
EXAMPLE: Recipe Response Rate

### Key Learnings
EXAMPLE: 
1. Implement personalized push notifications to prompt feedback 30 minutes after the estimated meal completion time. 
2. Begin A/B testing different visual styles for the feedback UI.

**MBL Initiative:** EXAMPLE: 
1. Launched v2 of the in-app micro-survey for recipe rating/feedback on the post-cook screen. 
2. Integrated feedback data stream with the Core Product database.

**Sprint Health:** 1. The new micro-survey placement significantly boosted response rate (17.5% vs. 15.0% baseline), validating the shift away from email prompts.

2. The new data stream integration confirmed that 70% of responses occur within 15 minutes of app session re-entry, suggesting we can optimize push notification timing.
