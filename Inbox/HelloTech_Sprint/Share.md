### Squad KPI
Referral Take Rate upon landing (% referral invites/referral page sessions)

### KPI Movement
Target: +5%  
Actual: -3.6% YoY

Compared to same week last year:
- Invites 2025 W4: 177742 | Take rate: 7.48%
- Invites 2026 W4: 141785 | Take Rate: 7.21%

Change: 
- Invites:-20.23% YoY | Take Rate: -3.6% YoY

Note: A fix to session data reporting went live in W4, so the accuracy of that data for the week is uncertain. For this review we have included invite rate as an additional metric.  This should be resolved for future weeks.

### Delivered (This Sprint)
1. Added fallback logic to ensure customers are presented the correct referral offer when CDP is unavailable or slow.  Approximately 5% of users were presented with the wrong offer terms.
2. Allocated 41k additional freebie invites to Factor Canada customers to drive additional conversions
3. Referral page migration for Pets Table and Goodchop to reduce code complexity and improve speed to test. We have 2 more markets to migrate

### Planned (Next Sprint)
1. New welcome page referral entry point on multiple HF markets targeting new users after a moment of joy [link]
2. Bring parity to Sharing options on mobile web to improve seamless sharing / invites. Mobile web is our highest traffic platform for referrals, and does not have all options to allow users to share referrals through the messaging platform of their choice
3. Launch contest module in additional markets (GB, DE, FR) to incentivize users to share more referrals in a limited time window, with an opportunity to win greater rewards

### Key Learnings
- Final approvals on plan to add additional target platforms for sharing referrals on mobile web delayed the start of work
- Use of Iterable integration for quick win new referral touchpoints (recipe rating) requires additional groundwork from CRM Engine squad and was not ready for integration in this sprint as planned
- With two target initiatives delayed, the split of work for this sprint was skewed heavily - 75/25 - to technical/platform improvements which will improve delivery velocity and reduce error rates. In the upcoming sprint, bottlenecks around decision making have been resolved and planned work is focused on deliveries with immediate impact to squad KPIs
