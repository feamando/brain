### KPI Movement
Rewards

### Delivered (Last Sprint)
EM: Bruno Klarin
PM: Thomas Gamper Feitoza

### Planned (Next Sprint)
Percent of earned rewards redeemed, in the Loyalty 2.0 program*

### Key Learnings
1. Loyalty 2.0 Rewards store complete with purchasing capabilities (connected to talon.one). Users will be able to purchase rewards and the points balance will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Introduction of loyalty 2.0 entrypoints in the end-to-end experience (Store, HomePage) to expand loyalty 2.0 presence.

**MBL Initiative:** We are working toward launching the MVP test of  our "Loyalty 2.0" program for HelloFresh US in March. The below deliverables are slated for release in February as a part of milestone 1 (Internal Launch - Friends & Family) of the new program.

1. Loyalty 2.0 Rewards Store connected to real rewards and points data, allowing users to: see their points, see their available rewards, and see rewards details.

**Sprint Health:** As part of FJ Loyalty experiment, we are observing that food related  rewards (e.g. 'Free breakfast reward') have a higher reward take rate (~23% on food related versus ~13% on comparable value discount voucher). We will use this learning to prioritise getting Food-based rewards as part of the Rewards store for Loyalty 2.0 as fast follow, as users demonstrated higher levels of interest.
