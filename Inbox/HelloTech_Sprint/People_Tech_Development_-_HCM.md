## People Tech Development - HCM
**Tribe:** Global People Technology
**Mega-Alliance:** Ops

### Squad KPI
% of Global Worker Data Quality & Completeness in Workday

### KPI Movement
HelloConnect (Philippines) rollout: Schedule RAG remains Amber; readiness improved versus last sprint following resolution of critical integration blocker

### Delivered (This Sprint)
HelloConnect (Philippines) Workday rollout progressed through late unit testing into E2E testing; 98% unit testing completed; E2E testing launched 26 Jan; critical Hire API issue resolved; ZKTeco clocks delivered; org structure and data strategy aligned; change management campaign launched

### Planned (Next Sprint)
Formal unit test sign-off; complete E2E testing cycle 1; commence physical clock testing and training; progress final data gathering toward go-live

### Key Learnings
SME capacity and late-stage scope changes are now the dominant risks, not configuration completeness
