### Delivered (This Sprint)
1. Tracking events for V1 of Food profile page 
2. Profile completion rate is now available as a metric
3. Gradual rollout of the new address form, starting with Sweden

### Planned (Next Sprint)
1. Bump up rollout traffic of Food Profile v1 to 100% at the start of the sprint
2. Finish development of Food profile v2 at the end of the sprint, allowing customers to add more data points to their profile (cuisine, dish type, flavors, proteins, etc.). Start gradual rollout.
3. Integrate profile completion metric into statsig to unlock experimentation
4. Rollout the new adddress form to more markets

### Key Learnings
14% of customers who were exposed to the Food profile page found and interacted with the page even without being nudged, signaling the strong need for customers to share their preferences (especially hard restrictions) with us.

Out of those interacting with the page, ±35% of them indicated at least one exclusion.
