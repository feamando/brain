### Planned (Next Sprint)
Factor B2B growth of 10x YOY

### Key Learnings
1. Build B2B order creation subscription engine
2. Investigate and integrate item level TIS tracking from HF systems into Shopify
3. Progress Youfoodz EDI for OTR and Metcach
4. Design and commence Point74 Recipe LCM into Youfoodz systems

**MBL Initiative:** Factor B2B Subscription
- APIs for front end complete - 25%
- Product sync from HF from CCM, PCS, OSCAR ready price integration 20%
- TIS Tracking data sync and APIs - complete at the order level - 20%

Youfoodz EDI
OTR onboarding - product mapping and pricing in testing - 25%

Recipe Life Cycle Management

**Sprint Health:** TIS tracking will need to be at a line item level and not at the order level to be able to track when orders have multiple boxes in Shopify
