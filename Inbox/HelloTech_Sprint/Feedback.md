## Feedback
**Tribe:** Shopping Journey
**Mega-Alliance:** Consumer
**Squad Lead:** EM: Luis Eduardo Talavera Rios
PM: Sandra Rozario

### Squad KPI
Recipe Response Rate

### KPI Movement
Recipe response rate = No of recipes rated/No of recipes shipped
W01-2026: 6%
W03-2026: 7.0%

### Delivered (This Sprint)
1. Quick comments starters (bubble options) in Past Deliveries completed on iOS and will be launched by 6th Feb. Android work is in progress and the android release will follow next week.
2. Completed the work for UI2 readiness for ChefsPlate
3. The frontend work to surface 'users’ favorite recipes' (highly rated and hearted) via widgets and nested pages in the store is complete. Over the coming weeks, we’ll focus on integrating the backend with the frontend. This is expected to create a positive feedback loop by demonstrating the value of rating, supporting faster meal selection, and ultimately increasing rating engagement over time.
4. Prep work on Backend for showing Users favorite recipe (related to point 3)

### Planned (Next Sprint)
1) Launch quick comments in Past Deliveries for android. 
2) Complete the work to show users recipe ratings and list of favorite items in a widget in storefront. 
3) Start the work for showing quick comment starters/ bubbles on the recipe rating nudge in apps.

### Key Learnings
We discovered some edge cases for why customers do not see the nudge (e.g. they cancel) and updated our logic accordingly
