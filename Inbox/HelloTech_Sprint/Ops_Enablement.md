## Ops Enablement
**Tribe:** Continued focus on stronger adoption of Workday Procurement for users and planned for additional markets to onboard in Q2
**Mega-Alliance:** Ops

### KPI Movement
eProcurement

### Delivered (Last Sprint)
Sara Felcher

### Planned (Next Sprint)
eProcurement Suite launched in all markets

### Key Learnings
1. Enable SSO on Ironclad to enable Jurist AI feature  
2. ANZ Workday Procurement Kickoff 2/2
3. CA Workday Procurement Kickoff week of 2/9 (to be scheduled) 
4. Enable CAPEX categories in Workday Procurement 
5. Align on approach and timline for Ironclad implementation

**MBL Initiative:** 1. Signed IronClad SOW / Immediately began working on enabling SSO to allow for legal teams to leverage the Jurist AI feature on Ironclad even before being live on tool for contract management 
2. Kicked off phase 2 workday procurement (ANZ/CA/Factor Verden) with Kainos team 
3. Further aligned on Marketing conversation and the need for Freshcost vs. MEL, working to streamline process for Marketing spend
4. Kicked off Ironclad implemenation with team and started planning for the HR and Procurement launch timing
5. Continued adoption and CI tasks and leveraged an existing implementation partner (Strada) to help with backlog and move faster

**Sprint Health:** Workday Procurement adoption is being hindered when users feel the tool takes longer than the previous process (lacking tooling) and better change management focus needed to onboard these groups and make sure concerns are heard and addressed. Meetings in progress to manage.
