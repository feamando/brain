### Squad KPI
% leads captured per session

### KPI Movement
N/A

### Delivered (This Sprint)
1. Wunderkind tactical fixes (drop in performance solved)
2. Fix for missing campaign customisation due to regional pricing changes  
3. Mapped all wunderkind customisation capabilities
4. Added missing catch-all rule + Rolled out Micro-tags v2 in IT + Rollout Web Performance Dashboard

### Planned (Next Sprint)
1. Spike: Wunderkind vs Internal solution 
2. Implement automated QA tests in Spur for Wunderkind flows 
3. Rollout of Micro Tags 2.0 in rest of INTL markets 
4. Clean up micro tags v1 and measure web performance impact
5. Continue the end-to-end user flow mapping

### Key Learnings
1. Lack of transparency and clarity on how Wunderkind campaigns are triggered. We have asked Wunderkindfor detailed information on the triggers and url params needed to properly QA the end-to-end experience 
2. We discovered that Campaign Customisation was disabled in September 2025 when changes to support regional pricing were merged on landing pages. Team implemented a fix
