## People Tech Development - Integrations
**Tribe:** Global People Technology
**Mega-Alliance:** Ops

### Squad KPI
# of Hours of Manual Work Eliminated

### KPI Movement
Integrations (cross-programme): Integration readiness improved versus last sprint, but end-to-end sign-off remains constrained

### Delivered (This Sprint)
Integration delivery across HelloConnect and Fresh Field progressed; Workday–Sprout Hire integration stabilised; Scan2Job testing advanced; 3010 SFTP connection established; Tableau development completed

### Planned (Next Sprint)
Close remaining integration test cycles; resolve data ownership and reporting decisions; support ORT and E2E testing with sufficient test data

### Key Learnings
Integration risk is now driven by data ownership decisions and test data sufficiency rather than technical defects
