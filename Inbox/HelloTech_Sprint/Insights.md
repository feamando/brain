## Insights
**Tribe:** Automated Q1 Insights completed: 1
Est. Impact TBD
**Mega-Alliance:** Ops

### KPI Movement
Automated Operations
Leonie Gablier

### Delivered (Last Sprint)
Virgil Brown

### Planned (Next Sprint)
Complete 6 insights projects guiding operational improvements

### Key Learnings
1. Finalize Safety Stock Analysis
2. Kick off Production Capacity Analysis - Barn
3. Kick off HFDN Drop Analysis

**MBL Initiative:** 1. Completed Cool Chain Analysis
2. Conducted maintenance for legacy reports

**Sprint Health:** -Cool Chain analysis identified positive effect on cancellations due to packaging reasons (-0.11 p.p.) On the other hand, the negative impact on error rate appears more substantial, with the compensation per box rising 0.31 €/box (0.08€ due to last mile errors). Given these considerations, further expansion of CoolChain does not appear favorable.
