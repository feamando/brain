**Mega-Alliance:** Ops

### KPI Movement
OpsTech France
PM & EL - Andreas Jakobsson

### Delivered (Last Sprint)
Thomas Saaby

### Planned (Next Sprint)
-% Features delivered that contribute to standardisation (in local tools & Hellotech code base)

*Features = stories, tasks are not counted within this KPI

### Key Learnings
- Next sprint we plan to continue to work on DPC and SKU dimensions
- We also plan to begin our work to improve our bulk compensation tool as it is has not been adapted to certain edge cases that can happen especially since we prepared future of food in production

**MBL Initiative:** - Local setup of DPC to evaluate performance in preparation for Project Odin rollout starting in Feb. Key point is that we are missing quite a few SKU volumes, which we are discussing with operations
- Completed script for harmonized approach for data sharing to IP within Conventional Cluster, where France deciated. Testing expected to commence Feb 10 assuming operations is ready. 
- We launched Click & Collect service for our own employees. Next step will be roll out for customers in Paris region.
