## Onboarding
**Tribe:** Conversions
**Mega-Alliance:** Growth
**Squad Lead:** EM: Ashwin Samtani
PM: Ana Sollitto

### Squad KPI
Incremental Settled Customers

### KPI Movement
n/a

### Delivered (This Sprint)
1. Updated HF INTL Welcome flow to reintroduce Welcome page
2. Built Redesigned Welcome page features usable for both HF and Factor
3. Completed ENG spike on App Deeplinking flow for new customers

### Planned (Next Sprint)
1. Welcome page redirect experiment - HF Global (had to add Welcome page back in INTL before we could go live)
2. Continue shared feature building for Welcome page redesign - experiment ETA end of Feb
3. Launch updated HF App login UI to align with new visual design across site (e.g. visually rich HF funnel)
4. 40% of Eng resources on loan to other teams - Snowplow Migration Events + Actives

### Key Learnings
Welcome page was accidentally removed from HF INTL Onboarding flow in June 2025, which was not discovered until new squad took over in January. It is important to regularly QA full experience (checkout --> onboarding steps) for all markets, our new tool Spur should help with this.
