## OpsTech Benelux
PM - Anaïs van den Hengel
EL - Jeroen Entjes
**Tribe:** Ops Tech Conventional
**Mega-Alliance:** Ops
**Squad Lead:** PO/EM:Thomas Saaby

### Squad KPI
-% Features delivered that contribute to standardisation (in local tools & Hellotech code base)

*Features = stories, tasks are not counted within this KPI

### KPI Movement
No movement 
(0% vs. 0% last sprint)

### Delivered (This Sprint)
The required features to go live with project Mosaic (deprecating GC, launching premium preference) has been delivered, including enabling more than 1 sorting line and allowing marketing to target premium customers for their marketing campaigns. This will drive value for our customers (launching a premium preference) and value for operations (simplification of not handling two seperate brands, giving more space for additional HelloFresh recipes)

### Planned (Next Sprint)
- End to end test run of the full tooling landscape with Mosaic test data (Before go-live in W09) 
- Enable core menu recipes to be planned on slots >10.000 to enable recipe variants (and thereby menu expansion) - removing legacy hard-coded rules
