## Automated Operations
Leonie Gablier
**Tribe:** Insights
**Mega-Alliance:** Ops
**Squad Lead:** Virgil Brown

### Squad KPI
Complete 6 insights projects guiding operational improvements

### KPI Movement
Automated Q1 Insights completed: 1
Est. Impact TBD

### Delivered (This Sprint)
1. Completed Cool Chain Analysis
2. Conducted maintenance for legacy reports

### Planned (Next Sprint)
1. Finalize Safety Stock Analysis
2. Kick off Production Capacity Analysis - Barn
3. Kick off HFDN Drop Analysis

### Key Learnings
-Cool Chain analysis identified positive effect on cancellations due to packaging reasons (-0.11 p.p.) On the other hand, the negative impact on error rate appears more substantial, with the compensation per box rising 0.31 €/box (0.08€ due to last mile errors). Given these considerations, further expansion of CoolChain does not appear favorable.
