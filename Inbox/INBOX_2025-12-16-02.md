﻿The Pets Table App v1: Notifications-First MVP

Date: 2025-12-11 Authors: Prateek JajooNikita GorshkovAhmed WagdiDaniel Arias Status: Draft





________________





1. Purpose

The Pets Table (TPT) faces a critical retention challenge: our Average Order Rate (AOR) lags behind competitors like Farmer’s Dog and Ollie, largely due to the lack of proactive, mobile-first customer engagement. This proposal outlines a low-cost, high-velocity strategy to deploy a TPT native mobile app. By leveraging a "webview-first" architecture (React Native shell + existing  web flows), we can bypass expensive native development to deliver v0 (Web Parity) and v1 (Push Notifications). The core value prop isn't the app interface itself, but the notification channel it unlocks—driving customers back to the service for order management and upsells, projected to generate ~$1.5M in annualized incremental revenue.

2. Current State / Problem

"Out of sight, out of mind."





* Lagging AOR: TPT’s AOR is trailing key competitors who utilize native apps to maintain persistent screen real estate and habituation.

* Reactive vs. Proactive: Our current web-only experience relies on customers remembering to visit our site or opening emails (20-25% open rate). We lack a direct, proactive trigger to prompt timely order management.

* Friction: Logging into a mobile website is high-friction compared to persistent app login, discouraging frequent "snacking" interactions where add-on upsells occur.

3. Strategic Solution

Build "The Notification Vehicle" Instead of a costly, multi-quarter native app build, we propose a Webview-First Hybrid App.





* Strategy: Use the Client Platform’s new React Native infrastructure to wrap our existing mobile web experience.

* Philosophy: "The app is a notification delivery vehicle with a dashboard face. Everything else is a webview."

* Cost/Speed: Minimizes engineering effort by reusing 90% of existing web code. Focuses native development strictly on the "Unlock" features: Push Notifications and Biometric Login.

Core Experiences: v0 vs v1

Feature

	v0 Scope (POC)

	v1 Scope (The Unlock)

	Goal

	Parity & Presence

	Engagement & Revenue

	Core UI

	Full Webview Wrapper (Pixel-perfect recreation of mobile web)

	Webview + Native Navigation Shell

	Authentication

	Persistent Web Session (Cookie-based)

	Persistent Web Session (Cookie-based)

	Notifications

	Web View (Deep-linked from Notifications)

	Upsell

	Standard Web Flow

	Push-Triggered Upsell (e.g., "Add treats to box shipping tomorrow")

	



Detailed scope sheet: Google Sheet Link

4. Business Impact

Hypothesis: Notifications drive frequency; frequency drives AOR and AOV.

Benchmarks (Weekly TPT Updates)

* Current AOR: Lagging behind key competitors (Farmer's Dog, Ollie).

* Competitor Engagement: Apps drive ~2x session frequency vs. mobile web.

* Push Open Rates: 5-10x higher than Email.

Projected Lift (Annualized)

Lever

	Mechanism

	Conservative Impact

	Revenue Impact

	Order Recovery

	"Last chance to edit" & "Card failure" pushes

	+5% AOR (App Users)

	~$1.1M

	Add-on Upsell

	"New treat" & "Box shipping soon" pushes

	+$2 AOV (App Users)

	~$400K

	Total

	



	



	~$1.5M

	



Assumptions: ~50k Active Subs, 30% App Adoption, $80 Base AOV.

5. Technical Strategy

We will leverage the new HelloFresh Client Platform capabilities to avoid building from scratch.





* Shell: React Native "Container"

... [TRUNCATED: 200 chars omitted to save context] ...

A (HelloFresh's notification infrastructure) and Braze/CRM for campaign management.

* Documentation: Infrastructure Architecture

6. Recommendations

1. Proceed with v0/v1 Strategy: Prioritize the notification unlock over native feature parity to maximize speed to value.

2. Leverage Client Platform: Utilize the existing React Native shell infrastructure to minimize overhead.

3. Launch & Learn: Ship v1 to validate the +5% AOR hypothesis before investing in further native features (v2).

Two options for V0: 

1. Maximizing web views and customizing the website to look more like an app, which is the least effort option, 

2. Involves having one core page (the dashboard) built with React Native and the rest as web views.

Webview (V0) Only:

Requirements:

* We need to customize for Mobile: header & footer

   * This is unknown effort to a complicated web setup and shared code

* Customize further as the App store may not be allowed for fully webview app 

* Estimated effort 2-4 weeks for 1 engineer (Conservatively)

   * But if it goes above 2 months, we should see if we can should do react-native directly. 





Cons: 

* Web view performance is usually worse, 

* Extensive customizations, such as changing dashboard appearance, would be harder to implement with web views.

* Eventually, we need to move towards all react native so important to webview work may be redundant 

* (Ahmed) Uncertainty of whether deep links (notifications to a specific in-app location) will work with web views





Webview (V0) + React-native dashboard:

* Prioritize Dashboard features (change delivery, change recipe, see feeding guide) & Add-ons

   * Why? - Better performance and user experience for the critical dashboard page.

* Dependencies:  React native platform architecture up in Q2 - So may not even be possible at launch in Q2. 

   * Ahmed: Sync backwards with the relevant team for updates on the infrastructure timeline.

* Timeline: 4 months, with building potentially starting around mid-Q2.





Questions:

1. Is V0 having any measurable impact? - Without notifications

2. We need a page to push the App installation - Checkout page

Accessibility-2025 Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Accessibility-2025 Program,,,,,,,,,,Recent action Items,,,,,,

,Welcome! The Accessibility-2025 Program will enable HelloFresh Group to complete HelloTech Objective #4 and comply with the modern level of accessibility for our customers driven by The European Accessibility Act (EAA). The program has two goals:,,,,,,,,,,🔄,"Resolve 90% of the P1 issues identified through Cypress that break 11 WCAG rules and manual audits in WEB.
Deadline: December 31st.",,,,,

,1,"Reduce the number of ""important"" Accessibility issues in HelloFresh, GreenChef, and Factor by 90% in WEB experiences by 28 June 2025, and in Mobile experiences by 31 Dec 2025.",,,,,,,,,🔄,"Resolve 90% of the P0 issues identified through Cypress that break 4 WCAG rules and manual audits in REACT NATIVE.
Deadline: December 31st.",,,,,

,2,Establish accessibility standards to support future HelloTech product development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Current P90 compliance,,,,,,source

,Background,,,,,,,,,,WEB,,,,MOBILE,,

,"The European Accessibility Act (EAA), which mandates that websites and mobile applications comply with WCAG 2.2 Level AA accessibility standards, will come into effect on June 28, 2025. The directive applies to all businesses in the EU, including HelloFresh. Non-compliance can result in penalties such as fines (ranging from 500–500k€) or, in some countries like Ireland, even prison sentences. Companies may also face legal action from disability advocacy groups.",,,,,,,,,,35%,,,,15%,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Remediating the risk of fines requires a company-wide collaboration, which is the background of launching this program. Apart from avoiding fines, improved Accessibility in our interfaces also gives us access to new potential customers (with disposable income) who previously may not have considered our product because they functionally were prevented from doing so. There is no calculated business case for the Group yet, but we plan to dig deeper into the opportunity in H2. The program will be driven by Foundations Alliance and involve all CFAs teams owning Front End TRE in mobile or web.",,,,,,,,,,2025 compliance target,,,,,,source

,,,,,,,,,,,WEB,,,,MOBILE,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Foundations Alliance made all Zest components compliant with EAA standards out of the box, however, this does not guarantee full compliance. To achieve full compliance by June 2025, all CFAs will review their journeys and modify them as needed. 

Foundations Alliance has provided the following inputs to enable CFAs to minimize their efforts:",,,,,,,,,,53%,,,,20%,,

, ☑️,"Improved Zest Design System components for iOS, Android, Web, and React Native platforms to have complete compliance with accessibility guidelines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,Created and maintain solution-oriented Accessibility Guidelines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,"Align, Define and Report upon an Accessibility Compliance Score.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,Automated the identification of code-driven accessibility issues based on the automated end-to-end UI Tests,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,"Provided results of a 3rd-party Accessibility Audit for HelloFresh, GreenChef, and Factor brands across web and mobile platforms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,"Created and maintain a company-wide backlog of Accessibility issues to enable compliance tracking on an ongoing, daily basis",,,,,,,,,Upcoming milestones,,,,,,

### DOC: LEGO: Unified Prospects Checkout Features and Layout for Meal Brands

﻿LEGO: Unified Prospects Checkout Features and Layout for Meal Brands





1. Goal





Our goal is to create a single, unified prospects checkout layout with standardized features that will work centrally for all Mealkit brands (HelloFresh, GreenChef, EveryPlate, and ChefsPlate) and RTE brands (Factor and Youfoodz).[a][b][c][d][e]





Checkout is a critical phase in the acquisition funnel where users register or log in, provide their address, select delivery options, and add payment details.

Unified feature is a shared component that can operate across multiple countries, brands, and user journeys. Once implemented, any new functionality built on this Feature is automatically available wherever the feature is deployed, ensuring consistency across the board. Features list are available on the portal: https://www-staging.hellofresh.com/features?f=DeliverySummaryFeature

Modular checkout is the checkout code setup, which consists of  independent, reusable unified Features.

Checkout layout is a structure for how elements are interconnected as part of it.





RTE - Ready-to-Eat Brands (Factor, Youufoodz)

WLMK/New Mealkits - Mealkit brands (GreenChef, EveryPlate, and ChefsPlate)









2. Problem Statement





The HelloFresh Group has expanded to 8 brands across 18 countries, which requires scalable solutions to avoid isolated work efforts. The prospects checkout process to purchase subscription can be identical across all brands and products, which makes it the first user experience that can be standardized and managed centrally.





In January 2025, the activation user journey scope was transferred from TAM Alliance to Growth Alliance to centralize Checkout ownership within one team. Two brands, GoodChop and Pets Table, remain in TAM. Scope now increased to 31 distinct codes to manage (18 in HelloFresh with 6 in New Mealkits and 7 in RTE added on top). To scale further and grow sustainably, a strong foundation is needed. HelloFresh has set an 2025 objective #1 to accelerate product development velocity for Ready-to-eat (RTE) brands by distributing ownership of core customer journeys across the consumer-facing-alliances (CFAs).





The Reduce Effort Needed to Checkout strategy initiated in 2024 involved refactoring the HelloFresh checkout into a modular checkout with unified features. By the end of 2024, the scope expanded to include RTE and WLML, aiming to unify features across all meal brands. More details are in Modular Checkout. The goal for H1-2025 is to complete feature modularization and unify the layouts for all meal brands. The new checkout layout will use the technical format that was created during the Single Page Checkout initiative. More details in Single Page Checkout: Experiment Results.

[a]NV not mentioned, despite accounting for ±$250M in annual revenue in 2025, planned $300M+ in 2026

[b]Original scope did not include NV, focusing on mealkits and RTE brands unification

[c]@nikita.gorshkov@hellofresh.com how would this work for NV? You have completely different features in your conversion funnels and the reuse of the same components across all brands is part of this initiative

[d]So, looking at the checkout features below, the majority of them are the same. While we have some additional features such as welcome kits and trial boxes, I think those can be built as additional components within Lego, no?

[e]Of course they can be built but would need to be ready for us to launch lego as well as all differences in areas like Logistics and Fraud, for example. We've been testing for 6 months across HF and Factor and are still adding/fixing things because of all the custom logic, so this will not be an easy addition. But we can definitely assist your team in adopting Lego

[f]@anupam.maurya@hellofresh.com let's add the ticket in the Epic for the items which will need to be moved to Features still.

_Assigned to anupam.maurya@hellofresh.com_

[g]@anupam.maurya@hellofresh.com for our layout work we would need to build this one in too right? Did you consider it in the broken down tickets?

[h]@harneet.singh@hellofresh.com what is the status here?

Dec 5, 2025 | Hamed:Nikita 1:1

Attendees: Nikita Gorshkov Hamed Karimian





Notes

* OTP Launch → decision: to have FF turn on in W02, but everything should be ready by EOY





Options

	Pros

	Cons

	Decision

	Launch W50

	More time before AD/ND

Time to iterate if issues

Time to rollout gradually





	Won’t make it! 

Less time for e2e testing

	No Go

	Launch W51 (To 90% of users)

	Original plan

On-track from dev pov

Captures business value earlier (~$15k in revenue)





	Super risky as most devs are out (Jordon, Jan, Edwin, Emily, Daniel, Travis)

Super close to EOY

Might break something on Factor

Not enough time for gradual rollout

On-calls: Emily Stanek (W50), Paul Andrews (W51/52)

	Maybe

	Launch W51 

(To only 10%)

	Mitigates the risk

Collects some feedback before the peak

	Still risky (Not enough devs to support)

Limited business impact





	No Go

	Launch W02

(To 90% of users)

	Less risky (Devs available for support)

Still before the actual peak

Won’t break anything on Factor/FF

	Delayed launch

Opportunity cost





	Go! 

	  W46 2024 - W04 2025 → The market is pretty soft over the last few weeks of the year

ckable only — no code).





Recruit 10–15 representative users (existing customers or target personas).





Ask them to choose between:





Current “build-your-own” flow





The new “plan-based” flow





Ask follow-ups:





Which feels more tailored to you?





Which would you trust more?





How likely are you to purchase?





✅ Advantages: Fast qualitative signal; surfaces objections early.

💡 Tip: Use Figma Analytics or Maze metrics (time on screen, clicks) for light quant data.





Option 3: “Fake Door” Test in Live Site





Goal: Measure real interest from actual users without building full functionality.





On your live PLP or homepage, add a new section or banner:





“Introducing our new lifestyle plans — Performance, Focus, and Foundation.”

CTA: “Explore Plans.”





When users click, send them to a “Coming Soon” page or a short survey:





“We’re launching soon — tell us which plan interests you most.”





Measure clicks, plan preference, and sign-ups for early access.





✅ Advantages: True behavioral data from live traffic.

💡 Tip: Works well if your current site already gets meaningful volume.





Option 4: Email or CRM Campaign Test





Goal: Validate resonance of messaging and pricing.





Segment your customer base (athletes, busy professionals, general wellness).





Send A/B email variants — one promoting current product set, one promoting “plans.”





Measure CTR, click-to-checkout, or pre-order intent.





✅ Advantages: Zero dev time, quick pulse check on messaging effectiveness.





📊 How to Evaluate Results

Metric        Signal        Success Criteria

CTR / engagement        Do users click into plan-based offers more than product-based ones?        +15–20% vs. baseline

Intent (survey or fake door)        Are users more likely to say they’d subscribe?        Majority (>60%) positive

AOV (simulated)        When choosing a plan, is average intended spend higher?        +10–15% lift

Qualitative sentiment        Do users say the plan feels easier, more relevant, or trustworthy?        Positive pattern emerges





If 2–3 of these indicators trend positively, that’s a green light to justify design + dev investment for a live experiment.





🚀 Recommended Next Step (Low-Effort, High-Insight)





Build a simple Figma prototype with your three plans + “Choose Plan” CTA, and test it via qualitative plan. (Option 2)

2026 Group Finance Domain Objectives 





This document summarizes the 2026 Objectives for the domain and answers FAQs. 

Working Group/PoCs: Christian GaertnerGreg ChisholmUwe VossMaria FernandezJohn Godevas Sarah OldHelge DoeringKristen J GouldRobert DiemAlan KearneyDaniel Alvarez Daniel Hindley Mark Holohan

________________





Finance & Legal Domain 2026

Section 2: Domain Objectives 





Our primary areas of investment proposed for 2026 are described below by priority. 





1. Objective: Transition from single year  to a  long-term (3 year) financial forecast, while also maintaining our role as current “partner/enforcer” to ensure HFG will  realize at least €500m of AEBIT and €400m FCF (post leases) in 2026

Measure of success: We have sensible core metrics (AOR, CAC, conversion growth, PC2 and capex) in our Adaptive budget for 3 years in all markets, aligned local and central leadership. For 2026 the most important single measure of success is our P&L and cash flow statement, where we target to achieve €500m in AEBIT and €400m in FCF (post-leases). 

Objective Owner:  Helge Doering

Investment Type: New    |   HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  5. Efficiency Program/Cost to Serve 

Description: We are moving to a three-year vision for our key metrics to secure long-term stakeholder commitment, which is updated each budget cycle based on latest developments. The systems to support this mostly exist but might need some improvements. Our main focus now is on stronger enforcement and team education. Looking beyond 2026 and using the foundation built by the GTO AEBIT cockpit, Finance and GTO will improve the planning process with a 3 year plan  with functional leaders to ensure key initiatives are captured and the business is steered with both a near and long-term vision by SMT leaders.

While ultimately achieving the objective 2026 is more driven by business functions, Finance and the AEBIT cockpit/GTO are partners for most Top 5 Strategies, with a special focus on Strategy 5 (efficiency program). A key part  will be > €1B spend flowing through Workday Procurement to ensure proper controls. The items Finance will deliver or partner with stakeholders for are:

* Clarify with leaders existing and incremental targets for 2026, actions and timings to achieve them. This will entail: 

   * Overachieving >300 mEUR+ cost savings target communicated externally, incl. 100 mEUR+ overhead savings

   * Paid Gross CCV/CAC+D of 0.95 (incl. 5% blended AOR uplift), single digit conversion growth and mPC2 (% of GR) of 46.5% for the Group. Group capex (including capitalized tech expenses) of below €150m

* To achieve the above goals, Finance will: 

   * Collaborate and challenge the business through tailored reporting of discretionary costs,  eg.  personnel costs, T&E, cost centers (esp. Multimarket reporting like Nexus) and take over responsibility for indirect personnel cost controlling from AEBIT cockpit in 2026

   * Ensure proper tracking of progress and enforcement of cost saving programs, including reconciliation between cockpit and P&L impact in budget / actuals



If decisions are made (e.g. more capex, lower procurement savings) that result in not achieving near-term targets or that materially impact the 3-year plan, they must be approved by the Group CFO and include analysis validating the trade-off. 





2. Objective: Improving accuracy and agility of forecasting vs. 2025 for both weekly cost reporting and monthly actuals to GCR

Measure of success: Primary metric is an AEBIT variance of MEC to GCR of less than 5% or 

... [TRUNCATED: 7951 chars omitted to save context] ...

is analyst reports and peer company content). Additionally, we have encouraged individuals to experiment with Gemini on their own and expect these individual experiments will impact our project list as the year progresses.  Many  opportunities are in the scoping and data gathering phase including using historical general ledger data to build estimates and to perform quick analysis on large data sets - if successful these efforts will allow us to close the books faster.  Two examples we have already implemented include: we reduced the MEC call attendance in the US by more than 50% and instead we create and distribute  a podcast based on Gemini notes; we’ve used Gemini to reconcile large data sets with no unique identifier where a many to one match based on $ amount was required.





   2. What are you doing to improve the customer experience?

As a support function our customers are internal stakeholders across HF  and our shareholders. Focusing on our internal customers, the most important things we can do  are related to DO #1 (proactively analyzing and identifying opportunities for function to improve, and holding them accountable to do so) and DO #2 (accuracy of real-time financial data to drive business decisions).  In addition, doing so in a low friction way is critical to limit the finance burden on other functions

   3. What are the known risks or obstacles to achieving these objectives?





There are two general risks to achieving our objectives. The first has to do with general business performance (regarding  AEBIT, FCF, downside ad hoc). For the most part, these are business functions driving the value and Finance accurately tracking. We can assist with accuracy intramonth via GCR to MEC. The second, which is understandable, is our objectives are not always ‘top of mind’ across the business. As examples, Objectives #2 (Accuracy) and #3 (Efficiency) will need to be accomplished without substantial support from Tech, which is generally focused on commercial teams. Another example is #5, where it is often hard to prioritize risk mitigation activities and ensure those on the front lines (e.g. AP at risk of fraud) always “stay frosty” to threats.





   4. What objectives would MDs and other key stakeholders be most disappointed to have left out for 2026? 





We shared our Domain Objectives with several executive leaders  and nothing was flagged.

[ae]@anisha.chandra@hellofresh.com do you agree this is the right statement for AAFCO?





@dovas@hellofresh.com FYI

_Assigned to anisha.chandra@hellofresh.com_

[af]This is the official statement "formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the

AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials) Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for All Life Stages, including growth of large size dogs (70 lbs. or more as an adult)"

[ag]If we need shorter, then I'm ok shortening to what NOM Nom have in their FAQ which is "Recipes meet standards set by AAFCO’s Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for all life stages."

[ah]@wellney.yarra@hellofresh.com - does it all go through you, or we can also add tix?

[ai]should we move the existing UI fix tickets to this epic?

[aj]@bowang.dai@hellofresh.ca have you had a chance to check this one?

_Assigned to _

[ak]Sorry, didn't get a chance to speak to this yesterday! Yes! I have reach out to squad consumer core. They have updated the reporting tab is no longer a supported feature. They only way to see recent conversions is via the DWH.

[al]I am currently reaching out to global BI to see how this information is pulled from DWH and which report pulls this information.

[am]FYI @dovas@hellofresh.com 





Thanks Bo!!

[an]gotcha - thanks you. maybe you can check if we can use "marketing report extract" from tableau?

[ao]Sorry team for missing this meeting as I was off. @dovas@hellofresh.com and @wellney.yarra@hellofresh.com is this the finalized RAF Values? 50% off the trial box and 20% off on the next two boxes? Is this correct?

[ap]Hey! Nope these were just example of the first box discount. For RAF it will be 100% off trial box, just pay for shipping and a TBD credit customer will earn for successful referrals

Problem Statement

Social media has become a primary hub for culinary inspiration, where people turn to influencers to discover new recipes. While Followers struggle to find the necessary ingredients and an easy way to re-cook them, Influencers look for new revenue streams to be more independent from the heavily controlled platforms and find new ways to expand their reach and engage with their audiences authentically and organically via food.





Opportunity:

Hellofresh sees a huge opportunity to serve both: by transforming influencers' inspiration (recipe) into a shoppable, cookable meal kit for the consumers. 

By bridging the gap as the Expert in operation, warehouses and logistics, we provide customers a way to enjoy these recipes easily and the influencer to serve their followers and create a new revenue stream. The social commerce market is growing rapidly and can represent a huge opportunity for us to attract new customers.





Why now:

We see the urgency to act now, because influencers are already trying to solve this problem with links to ingredient orders  via Instacart or Pinterest partners with Instacart to enable 1-click grocery list generation from saved pins. But today, shoppable content on social media within the food category is often limited to individual food items as opposed to a holistic offering where the ingredients for entire recipes and direct delivery can be purchased. 





The Core Ask 

WBD: Influencer Marketplace

Explore desired and viable vision for a curated recipe creator marketplace (1. influencer, 2. Aggregators) with the option of an  instant purchase as a meal kit ‘fulfilled by HelloFresh’.





Long-term Vision (Later) 

Transform HelloFresh into the “Spotify for food”  a platform where any creator can share a recipe that HelloFresh fulfills.

Prototype Test

Prototype for evaluating the concept













[a]@shay.obaidullah@hellofresh.ca

[b]@katheryn.eckles@hellofresh.com I think this part is important, people might be interested in purchasing this meal but maybe not in that moment. So giving them the opportunity to save it and buy later is something to consider for mvp

[c]@shay.obaidullah@hellofresh.ca

[d]@katheryn.eckles@hellofresh.com i wonder if this would be a simple Q&A section or a crowdsourced Q&A

[e]would we need to create a hellofresh shop with all influencer recipes to shop and the influencer itself advertise it?

,,

,Plan,Pricing Principles at Launch

,All,Max box price should be $250 

,Fresh/Topper/Mixed,Max freezer fill is 1/3 a small NYC apt freezer

,Fresh,Aim to price lower than TFD but only if we can make PC2 margins and economics work

,All,Charge shipping separate to box price

,All,Shipping free in first order

,All,Price per day for trial is same as for regular box before discount

,All,Price per lb does not need to decrease as calories increase within same plan although it should go in that general direction

,All,"If we ship the same amount of product, the price should be the same"

,,

,Step,Description

,1: Import costs,All costs by plan imported into pricing file

,2: Benchmark,Competitors benchmarked to build up their pricing curves

,3: Scenarios,"High level pricing scenarios chosen per plan - final scenarios chosen:
- Fresh: Match TFD prices excluding shipping fee. Fresh is headline price to fix rest to
- Mixed: Should be 5-15% below Fresh depending on size and margins
- Topper: Should be 55-62.5% of Fresh price for 50% of product depending on size and margins
- Dry: Should be lowest price and price at 38% margins"

,4: Smooth pricing,Scenarios lead to choppy pricing. This was then smoothed

,5: Check PC2 / ROIs,PC2 and ROI reviewed to increase prices and improve margins where they were low

,6: Make steps,"If giving the same qty of product for 2 or more different SKUs, the prices were matched to create some stepped pricing"

,,

,,

,Type,Elements to Change in Price Test

,Architecture issue,Ensure same amount of food in box is always the same price

,Architecture issue,Review price per Lb curves i.e. price per LB should go down as calories increase

,Architecture issue,Review PC2 margins by calories within plan; and PC2 margins across calories

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Air Dried price to have lower entry price point to increase TAM

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Fresh price to be more competitive with Farmers Dog & Ollie

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Mixed price to sit in appropriate area between Fresh & Air Dried (being wary where Pantry Fresh would be)

,Architecture issue,"Lower price for larger dogs more than smaller dogs to encourage share of larger, higher ROI dogs"

### EMAIL: Low allocation of Boxes for Verden for the CO1 W-52 In MIDAS
ID: 19b273c56a9224b9
From: "'Owys Garaybeh' via HelloFresh Critical" <critical@hellofresh.com>
----------------------------------------

Hi Team,



We use MIDAS for our allocation planning, and for critical weeks like week

52. The allocation was checked yesterday and in MIDAS the CO1

allocation for W52 was 1203 and with today's run it is 790 only.



however the expected allocation is at least 2300. if the allocation in

MIDAS is somehow correct means that at least 1000 boxes will be affected.



The request is to check why MIDAS run is allocating to little boxes for VE

and if the actuals will look similar. so that we know how to mirage the

risk and plan accordingly.
