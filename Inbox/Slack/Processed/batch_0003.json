This is determined by any subscription object that has `is_program_weightloss`  tag in the `subscription.productType.family.tags` object\n\nSpecifically, because a user can have multiple subscriptions, we had a scenario where the reactivation banner was being shown for a user with a standard active Factor subscription (because they had a deactivated program subscription). The solution was to move the Programs subscriptions to the end.\n\nIdeally this should not impact users with a single subscription but it would impact users with multiple subscriptions especially for users with 1 active and 1 deactivate subscription. Validate\n1.  the reactivation banner behavior doesn't change\n2. Rewards/ Wallet section\n3. Reactivation banner on the plans page (if any)\n4. Share with Friends / Feed Friends section\n5. Any other section that relies on order of subscriptions - such as banners\nEnsure no side effects."
