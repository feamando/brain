Weekly trends remain positive with most metrics showing growth compared to November 25th, suggesting underlying business momentum despite short-term fluctuations. *Key Insights:*\n• Order volume of 14 on Dec 2nd represents +57% weekly growth (vs 8 orders on Nov 25th), demonstrating strong week-over-week momentum despite the -36% daily decline from Dec 1st's peak of 22 orders\n• Conversion funnel shows concerning top-funnel weakness with landing page views dropping -17% day-over-day to 578, while products page views declined -29% to 1,051, indicating potential traffic acquisition or retention issues\n• Mid-funnel conversion from products to signup remained weak at 5.2% (55/1,051), significantly lower than the 7.5% rate seen on peak days, suggesting product page optimization opportunities\n• Checkout-to-order conversion rate of 20.3% (14/69) on Dec 2nd remains healthy and above the period average of ~15%, indicating strong purchase intent among users who reach checkout\n• Weekly comparison reveals positive trends across all metrics: landing views +0.9%, products views -5.8%, signups -34%, checkouts +21%, and orders +75%, with the order growth being the most critical business indicator",
