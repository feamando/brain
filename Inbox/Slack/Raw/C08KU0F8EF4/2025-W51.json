Legacy Tech &amp; Migration (Primary Reason):\n       * Good Chop has been operating on a \"shared Whitelabel\" dashboard infrastructure that lacked brand-specific customization.\n       * The team is currently in the middle of a \"Dashboard Improvements\" initiative to migrate Good Chop away from this shared legacy system. The priority has\n         been stabilizing the current platform and enabling core commerce features (like Charge at Checkout) rather than building advanced subscription management features like multi-week visibility.\n\n   2. Strategic Pivot to E-Commerce (Business Reason):\n       * Good Chop is actively trying to move away from the rigid \"subscription plan\" model (which \"Future Boxes\" reinforces) and towards a flexible E-Commerce /\n         One-Time Purchase (OTP) model.\n       * Investing heavily in a UI that emphasizes \"managing your next 4 subscription boxes\" would have been counter-strategic while the business was trying to\n         build \"Charge at Checkout\" and \"OTP\" flows to allow customers to buy what they want, when they want, without being locked into a rigid weekly cadence.\n\n   3. Inventory &amp; Sourcing Complexity:\n       * Unlike standard meal kits, Good Chop's \"digital butcher\" model relies on specific cuts and sourcing. Managing guaranteed inventory visibility for weeks         into the future is significantly more complex for specific protein cuts than  for general meal kit ingredients, making a \"future box\" view operationally riskier to promise.\n\n  Future Outlook (Roadmap)\n  According to the H1 2026 Roadmap, the \"New Dashboard Release\" in Q2 2026 will finally introduce:\n   * Future Boxes: Full visibility into upcoming deliveries.\n   * Add-on Upselling: Easier ways to add items to upcoming orders.\n   * Premium Swaps: Options to upgrade cuts in future boxes.```",
