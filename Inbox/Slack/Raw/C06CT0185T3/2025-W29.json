Is this work we already have on our roadmaps as we adopt CDPS?\n\nIf not, we ideally have to prioritize it in the next 2 sprints. Technically they asked for this to be done by end of July but IMO this is unrealistic. I have aligned on a mid Aug deadline instead but want to confirm that we can make this change for our TPT and GoC brands before then. The change itself looks pretty straightforward to me",
