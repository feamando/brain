I'll put an example from GoodChop, but the same is observed for TPT.\n• Customer goes to \"plan change\" flow (any flow that is related to changing subscription SKU). For example,  changing from \"6 cuts\" to \"8 cuts\".\n• We patch the subscription SKU, but all the upcoming deliveries stay the same (\"6 cuts\") because of customer recurring selection that ensures the same selection (including the seamless size change) for all the upcoming boxes.\n• In theory, we should submit a new meal selection (also with a new SKU) to set a new source of truth for recurring selection, but we only have 6 out of 8 cuts selected.\nThe question to product folks - how this should work from customer perspective?",
