You are right, reviewing a PR of this size is a big ask, and we want to make it as easy and safe as possible for your team.\n\nSince Tamir is off today and changes are tightly coupled, breaking it up now might be tricky and could introduce risk. To help move this forward, how would you feel about one of these options:\n\na. Continue with the current PR and I can add more detailed documentation.\nb. Moving the `tracking` events to a new PR since these are a new addition and it could have some improvements, as you mentioned.\n\nWe believe this refactor is an important step for the Discount Communication feature, so I'd love to find a path to get this reviewed and merged before the weekend. Please let me know what works best for you. :praycat:",
