Please check the details.\n*Question title:* `MAS to Cart migration: Query on mr-persist-free-addons' usage of GET /v2/selection`\n*Topic:* `Other`\n*Details:* `Hi team! We are working on the initiative of making cart the source of truth for meals and addons. As part of that process, we need to make sure requests are going through cart for some of the endpoints in MAS.\n\nWhat will change:\nWe have implemented the proxy in cart. We just need to change the host from mas to cart. Everything else will remain same. \n\nSpecifically, the change would be:\n- In toolbox/commands/mr-persist-free-addons/api/fetchAddonsSelection.ts, update the URL construction to point to cart-service instead of directly to MAS\n- Current: <https://menu-addons-service>.${cfg.env}-<http://k8s.hellofresh.io/v2/selection?${queryParams}|k8s.hellofresh.io/v2/selection?${queryParams}>\n- New: <https://mss-cart-service>.${cfg.env}-<http://k8s.hellofresh.io/v2/selection?${queryParams}|k8s.hellofresh.io/v2/selection?${queryParams}>\n\nLet us know if we need anything else here.\n\nQuestion:\nFrom the Github search we found mr-persist-free-addons calling GET /v2/selection endpoint. Is this an active use-case? \n\nIf you confirm then we can help creating a PR. But we will need help on testing the script.\n\nTimeline:\nWe're planning to complete this migration as soon as possible possible by next week.
