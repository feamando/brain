Unfortunately in such scenario BE still holds stale SKU meal selections scheduled.The way we handle this gap in the frontend is, we re-select meals on new SKU on users behalf (regardless if its a cadence change or other reason), so that box content service always gets propagated with the new SKU selections. We patched this partially a ~week after after 10th of December (when this user has been affected).

It is designed to be used in conjunction with the following best practices:\n- Test data is not deterministic: Avoid relying solely on random values for testing. Instead, consider using deterministic test data that consistently align with the expected outcomes. This approach ensures more predictable and reliable test results.\n- DOM Selector Reliability: Pay attention to the reliability of DOM selectors used in tests. Duplicate selectors or selectors that appear after a delay can lead to flaky tests. Aim to use unique and stable selectors to ensure consistent test behavior.\n- Test Execution Time: Avoid making assumptions about specific times in tests. Test scenarios should be designed to handle different time frames and dynamically adapt to the current date/time. This approach increases the flexibility and resilience of the tests.\n- Following the Cypress best practices https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices\n\nYou can use the https://github.com/hellofresh/web/pull/63052 to revert the changes and add your fixes to the spec.\n\nFind more information about the quarantined system here: https://hellofresh.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FI/pages/3949987114/Reduce+the+flakiness+for+web+tests\n\nYou can also reach out to the team at #squad-nv-pet-food or #squad-web-foundation s to discuss the quarantined system.",

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#eae6ff}\n*Description*\n\nWhen user is editing their delivery address we run validation on their delivery option and if its no longer valid for the new address then we update it to a new delivery option, when we change their delivery option we currently filter the delivery options based on cadence, E.g. if it’s a plan that should have a 4 week cadence, we filter the options to only return anything with {{*-4WEEKLY}}. As on of the first steps in deprecating the cadence delivery options, we want to filter out all cadence delivery options that have cadence in them (anything with {{WEEKLY}} at the end).
