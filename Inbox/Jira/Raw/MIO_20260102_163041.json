      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#deebff}\n*Content*\n\n*Phase 1 (M0): Green Chef NL to HelloFresh NL Migration*\n\n* Phase 1 focuses on the migration of approximately *6,000 active Green Chef Netherlands customers* to the HelloFresh NL Premium tier. This migration is necessary due to Green Chef's closing and is intended to give these customers a better home\n\n*Phase 2 (M1): HelloFresh Premium Tier A/B Test*\n\n* Phase 2 involves the launch of the Premium tier option for *active HelloFresh customers* in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. It would also include an A/B test to measure the impact on the business.\n{panel}\n\n{panel:bgColor=#eae6ff}\n*Documentation:*\n\n* [https://docs.google.com/document/d/15ed_XKz9mITBJR9kPbc607YskJtQ-izQCrGkopcICGw/edit?tab=t.jwwlvys34aag#heading=h.e8pb13jctmh4|https://docs.google.com/document/d/15ed_XKz9mITBJR9kPbc607YskJtQ-izQCrGkopcICGw/edit?tab=t.jwwlvys34aag#heading=h.e8pb13jctmh4|smart-link] \n* [https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/2cd0b4e0-f8b8-4a93-8a2b-dd7560547b8d|https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/2cd0b4e0-f8b8-4a93-8a2b-dd7560547b8d]\n{panel}\n\n{panel:bgColor=#deebff}\n*Hypothesis*\n\n*Phase 1 (M0): Green Chef NL to HelloFresh NL Migration*\n\n* The migration is driven by the need to give Green Chef Netherlands customers a *better home* because Green Chef was underperforming and is being closed down. The core hypothesis is that successfully migrating these customers to a newly created *Premium Tier* will allow HelloFresh to *retain* valuable revenue from the existing Green Chef customer base.\n* This is achieved by offering the Green Chef customers a dedicated product family that maintains a price point close to what they were currently paying, thereby *avoiding price friction* during the migration and maximizing retention of the approximately 6,000 active GC customers.\n* The Premium tier offering is intended to be relevant to these customers, as the regular HelloFresh product would not be premium enough compared to what they were used to at Green C",
