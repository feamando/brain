      "description": "h2. Context\nThe {{Root.js}} file in the checkout flow is currently implemented as a class component using legacy Redux patterns. This makes it difficult to:\n* Use modern React hooks\n* Integrate with newer data-access patterns\n* Maintain and test the component\n* Apply modern best practices\n\nh2. Current State\n* *File*: {{app/spaces/whitelabel/modules/whitelabel-web/packages/libraries/store/src/checkout/Root.js}}\n* *Implementation*: Class component with {{mapStateToProps}} and {{mapDispatchToProps}}\n* *Redux*: Uses legacy Redux selectors and actions\n* *Hooks*: Cannot use modern hooks like {{useGetCustomerSubscriptions}}, {{useHasOTPInCart}}, etc.\n\nh2. Proposed Changes\n1. *Convert to Functional Component*: Migrate from class component to functional component\n2. *Modernize Data Fetching*: Replace Redux selectors with {{@/data-access}} hooks where applicable\n3. *Use Modern Hooks*: Leverage React hooks for state management and side effects\n4. *Improve Type Safety*: Add proper TypeScript types (convert from {{.js}} to {{.tsx}})\n5. *Simplify Logic*: Refactor complex lifecycle methods into cleaner {{useEffect}} hooks\n\nh2. Benefits\n* Easier to maintain and extend\n* Better integration with modern patterns used in other guards (e.g., {{FactorFormCheckoutGuard.tsx}})\n* Improved type safety\n* More testable code\n* Consistent with current development standards\n\nh2. Related Work\n* This migration was identified during the implementation of GOC-3427 (OTP checkout fix)\n* The current implementation works but uses patterns that are being phased out\n\nh2. Acceptance Criteria\n* [ ] {{Root.js}} is converted to a functional component ({{Root.tsx}})\n* [ ] All class lifecycle methods are replaced with appropriate hooks\n* [ ] Redux selectors are replaced with modern data-access hooks where possible\n* [ ] Component maintains all existing functionality\n* [ ] All existing tests pass\n* [ ] New tests are added for any refactored logic\n* [ ] No regressions in checkout flow",
