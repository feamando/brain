﻿Final YP





💡 Meeting Notes [To be filled after the Review Meeting by the YP Document Owner and sent out via email to attendees. This section does not impact the maximum number of pages]

Review Meeting Date: Oct 16, 2025

Attendees: Ed Boyes Assaf Ronen Dominik Richter Holger Hammel,Cho HwangAnnie MeininghausDina MehrezThomas GrieselFabien SimonMarlene RosnerBrian LeungAdriana VillarEvan WeintraubJama Musse





Key Takeaways, Decisions, and Next Steps:

1. Clarify how menu expansion plans, personalization roll outs  and app features come together: 

   * Elysium (new store and homepage in the app) roll out is fast followed by new app feature which benefits users  irrespective of menu ranking roll out (most notably merchandising widgets for marketing,  recommendation widgets,bringing search to apps, populating “most popular, “trending” widgets - details)

   * Menu ranking roll out: At the same time there is a roll out plan for menu ranking models which prioritizes P500 readiness in Q4/Q1 as well as Penguin for Factor US. Food Systems is trying to expedite Penguin for INTL if possible, prioritized after p500. Fall back is to launch Penguin Harp personalization to INTL markets expanding in Q1.  Other RTE markets in H2.

2. Share prioritization framework  for Project 5M. The prioritization is heavily influenced by successful companies and features observed (direct or indirect competitors) as well as through an internal workshop. This revealed a consistent and significant behavioral gap: Users enthusiastically save recipes (often from social media) but rarely act on them. This indicates a high desire for inspiration but a significant friction point in execution. This led to the prioritization of the recipe bridge in Q4/Q1. If requested we can  walk through the detailed methodology.

3. Decouple forecasting from personalization models. Food Systems to define technical interfaces enabling independent iteration. Once validated, assess org impact in Q1–Q2.

4. Reconcile marketing RAF plan with tech YP.  We have addressed the  gap between Marketing and Consumer growth targets. Share squad will focus on strengthening the Refer-a-Friend (RAF) program while building new in-product sharing loops to drive organic growth. prioritizing foundational fixes — improving data visibility, customer experience, and operational agility — to make the RAF program self-sufficient and easier to optimize without tech dependencies. 

5. Variable pricing is an urgently requested feature by markets. We added it  to the Market Innovation squad backlog H2. Will define long-term ownership before initiation as we are currently moving pricing ownership to growth MA. 





Changes requested to the Yearly Plan during Draft Reviews. Please update before submission for final YP approval:  

* Should we invest into an AOV-focused squad? Yes we will self fund a new AOV driven squad in Q2 with a dedicated KPI. Focus in Q1  is first to roll out the new personalized core journey including widgets and then layer in more upselling components. 

* Loyalty strategy across markets: We decided to reserve a small team to  maintain and improve the existing  program while implementing  the new vendor based loyalty program to launch first in  the US . See Loyalty Strategy SMT Shareout.

* Double check if all Factor requirements are in the plan: All documents were collected and integrated into the Market Innovation backlog. To be signed off by Ed Boyes

This sheet provides the percentage of operational overhead (i.e. KTLO work per month). Each team has a dedicated tab. For this to work, you need to
* add the label KTLO to all Jira tickets that you consider KTLO work
* Make sure all tickets that move into the “resolved” state have assigned story points. Add the actual story point in hindsight for accurate operational overhead calculation
A cron job runs every night and updates this sheet. It used the resolved date to include a ticket in the calculation for a specific month.

Update:





*For SCENARIO 1





*[1]CID = 2665026. For this account which I first refunded via OWL (did not work according to Payments), then via Bob - I finally got the refund. So we can confirm that refunds via Bob still continue to work even for initial orders with Charge @ CheckoutFor SCENARIO 2





*However for [2]this account (only refunded via OWL), I still did not receive a refund and as Ganga confirmed - no record of a refund was present via their Payment dashboards.



Are there any new findings why initial orders using Charge @ Checkuot doesnt work via OWL?

### EMAIL: ✌️ Goodbye, Adieu & Tschüss
ID: 19afd3c8faa3de4c
From: Elisabeth Bommes <elisabeth.bommes@hellofresh.com>
----------------------------------------

Hi everyone,



After four years, four C-level KRs, four squads, and four alliances (= 4²),

it's time for me to say goodbye. It's been a pleasure working with you

across time zones and Databricks workspaces.



My last working day is this Friday, December 12th.

While my last on-call shift is on Sunday, please don't cause any Smart

Bidding or AGE incidents just to say goodbye. I know you're better than

that!



If you'd like to catch up before I leave, I'll be around this week.

Come and grab a coffee or Glühwein with me in the office or at the HF

Holiday Market (my tribe recently moved to P89, Floor 2, Section B).

For folks outside of Berlin, there'll also be one of those hilariously

awkward farewell meetings. Stay tuned for the details.



Thanks for everything and wishing you all the best!

Elisabeth



*PS: I'd love to stay in touch! You can find me on LinkedIn
