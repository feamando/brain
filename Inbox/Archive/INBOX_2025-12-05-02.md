Squad Wins from Last Week

🐶 Pet Food

   * Launched Project Heaven (deceased pets)

   * Reconfigured default cadences - For most pets the default cadence is the less frequent (i.e. cheaper) option, but our bigger plans were an exception where the more expensive plan was the default. This was changed and we expect it to improve our conversions for bigger dogs

   * Increased multi-pet limit from 3 to 5

   * [In-progress] Deprecating cadence delivery options - The BE no longer relies on delivery options to manage cadence but the FE still uses it and our users are all still assigned to cadence delivery options. We have started doing the FE work required to completely deprecate these delivery options. We’re doing this to

We aligned with Platform on our proposed solution, and they expect to unblock this by tomorrow. In the meantime, we started preparing the NV-CRM migration configuration. Note: We’re the first team migrating a monorepo with stateful sets to FTCP, so no platform guidelines exist yet.

   * Enable Price Testing for TPT: We scoped the work and broke down the tasks. Implementation has started on OPS, and work on the remaining services (Price-service and NV-CRM) will begin once the OPS changes are completed.

   * NPS Migration to Profile Service: We met with Ciro and the former RTE Systems team to discuss the Profile Service 2.0 RFC. Building on our initial proposal, Ciro introduced an improved approach that generalizes the solution and significantly reduces the scope of work needed for NPS migration. The POC is already created the team will review and we will meet again this week to finalize the details. With the new proposal, the required migration effort will be much lower than originally planned.

With the broader adoption, and the launch of the GraphQL API, the proposal is to move this responsibility to the backend via NV-CRM events.

Live migration and monitoring are planned for next week. PCS: Currently on hold due to shifting priorities and limited team capacity.

Given the high complexity and the impact on upstream/downstream teams—combined with current resourcing constraints—the decision was made not to proceed with the POC at this time. The topic will be revisited in 2026, potentially as part of a full launch initiative.

         * NV-CRM – Future of the Service: The team prepared an internal proposal outlining the future direction of the NV-CRM service. We've created tickets to simplify the system and make full use of the new checkout event.

We also identified constraints and are using manual workarounds to validate our assumptions. 

         * NV-CRM – ADR Future state of the Service: The team initiated a discussion about the future state of NV-CRM.

            * Project Emerald: We held a joint meeting with stakeholders and Ops Tech, and the Demand & Forecasting team to present our proposed tech solution for ringfenced menus. While we've made solid progress, we've identified several constraints and are currently using manual workarounds to demonstrate that the POC is functional. These workarounds help validate the approach, but additional effort will be required later for a proper implementation. 

            * TPT Loyalty Program: We’re collaborating with the Habit Building Tribe to accurately calculate box count for multi-subscription customers, ensuring the correct assignment of loyalty levels.

🐶 Pet Food

                     * This week the team continued to focus on the Air Dried cadence test. This initiative aims to convert air dried users into a lower cadence in order to reduce the price shock when they reach checkout. 

                     * On Wednesday we also deactivated all discontinued SKUs (Half of Fresh plan and discontinued calories).

                     * The team also started preliminary work for our next fresh recipe launch (Pork Stew with Butternut Squash) coming on Tuesday (June 10th).

                     * Last Friday we had an incident in our multi-pet checkout flow where customers were not seeing all available payment methods, which prevented checkout. The root cause of the issue was an experiment being run by the Payments team and it was mitigated by disabling it for TPT. The experiment was running for a small portion of traffic (5%) for the past month. PM is yet to be completed.

                     * Scoping for our next big initiative (Allergies) is also being finalized.

The team also held an onboarding session for UAT participants, with UAT officially starting on Thursday next week.

                     * FTCP Program – Still blocked. We've paused all work and deprioritized our efforts until the issues on the Platform side are resolved. At the moment, we’re unable to migrate any of our 5 services and have communicated this decision to the Platform team.

                     * PCS Support for Multi-Subscription – The ADR is approved and merged. The solution has been broken down into tasks, and the team has already started work on Milestone 1, focusing on changes to the API contract.

⚙️ 🌍 New Ventures Systems

This week, the team shifted focus to prioritize the KRS Live epic as we approach the deadline, with TPT requiring it by Week 13.

                              * KRS Live: We introduced new custom metrics for processors and repartitioners, which will serve as the foundation for defining SLOs. Additionally, we deployed a critical set of E2E tests to enhance detection and improve the overall quality of KRS.

                              * FTCP Program: The team signed up for the FTCP program and wrapped up most of the prep work. This is part of our OKR objective: Operational Excellence, where we aim to migrate 100% of all live containerized Kubernetes services owned by New Ventures to the new FTCP infrastructure.

                              * On-Call Readiness: In preparation for launching On-Call support in Q2, we have partially completed the ORC checklist for all services to ensure we are fully prepared.

                              * Pre-Checkout RFC Update: The Pre-Checkout Selection RFC was rejected by the Consumer Core Tribe. As a result, the team has decided to redo the RFC, shifting focus solely to Trial Boxes instead of addressing multiple issues. This change is necessary to move Trial Boxes out of Intfood, enabling the Consumer Core team to proceed with their initial order deprecation initiative.

                                             * We have resumed working on Deprecating Preferences. Context: Currently, TPT relies on preferences for meal selection, which was originally implemented to maintain meal consistency from one order to the next and allow for pre-checkout meal selection. We will be transitioning to a recipe selection system using PCS for pre-checkout meal selection and KRS for maintaining meal selection from one order to the next.

🌍 Market Launch

                                             * Factor Germany:

This week, the team focused on supporting the brand and content teams to improve German language localization for the Factor Germany launch. This involved exporting copies of high-traffic pages and enabling targeted language adjustments. Additionally, the mobile apps were resubmitted to the App Store and Play Store, followed by a final round of testing to ensure full functionality (Disabled for download until the full launch). With the newly confirmed launch date of Thursday, November 14, we are now concentrating on finalizing the website and addressing lower-priority bugs to enhance the user experience before launch.

                                             * HelloFresh Netherlands (English multi-language) support:

We made substantial progress in configuring the website and mobile apps, with most mobile app work completed and a few final configurations remaining on the website. Initial testing on the website showed that critical paths and core functionalities are working as expected. However, during the week, an incident occurred after deploying a locale switcher in production, which led to a 404 error affecting around 290 customers. We promptly reverted the change and are preparing a post-mortem document to analyze and address the issue.

TPT customers will now be able to add add-ons to their subscription plans instead of just their next box, aligning with the standard practice among leading pet food companies. This change aims to improve the add-on take rate.

                                                            * We discovered that after UPM integration, the acceptance rate of PayPal transactions has dropped from 95% to 37%. During investigation it turned out that the UPM component was attached to a HF DE PayPal account, which resulted in customers using paypal being declined after cut-off due to BILLING_AGREEMENT_NOT_FOUND. Payments team has enabled shared billing agreements between KN and DE and after the Thursday cut-off 92% of Paypal transactions are successful.

💻 Other Tech Notes

This week, web-foundation with our assistance investigated an incident (for 2.5-days 😵‍💫) - #in-31817-2404 Some customers would experience 500 errors every time we do a deployment. It was present probably forever and increased on March 21st. The amount was not too crazy (about 50-200 cases per deployment depending on the traffic across all web-repo requests), yet it might have affected you - you might have experienced this issue, saw customer complaints, or maybe adjusted your SLOs to match this “accepted failure rate”. Letting you know that now it is resolved!

Small note from tribe leadership, 





We continue transitioning into New Ventures & Ecosystem and include updates from tribemates across the globe - US, Canada and Germany! We couldn’t be more excited to be working with each and every team member in 2024. We have got ambitious, exciting, and cool plans for 2024. If you want to understand where roadmaps and team setups are coming from, you are invited to go through them in the 2024 HelloTech Yearly Plan - TAM Expansion Alliance Final and get pumped!





Throughout the coming weeks, we work mindfully on transitions, handovers, on and off boarding sessions. These will hopefully set us up as a consolidated organization by February 1st. We’re fully dedicated to support everyone in case of a transition and beyond. We are always here to talk, so please reach out. The doors are always open as we literally have no doors! 😀





Have a great year ahead, 

Tobias & Nikita

======

Dear Team, we wanted to provide you with a personalized and heartfelt message from ourselves and this is the best that we came up with: 

  



But in all seriousness…

Dear Team,

Thank you for all your passion and contribution in 2023. You have been an amazing team. We, personally, have enjoyed every moment of working together with you - no matter if it was laughing, discussing, planning, executing, struggling, or winning. For us as New Ventures, it was an incredibly successful year. Simply put - you absolutely rock. 🧑‍🎤

It is always a balancing act when calling out achievements. Too easy to miss something or suggest an order. So, let us go by the alphabet and share some highlights from our perspective. (Of course, there were many more!)

B2B: You’ve ramped up an entire new business from scratch and even convinced our Management Board that B2B does work. All the challenges you took from navigating a lot of unknowns, ambiguity, and a new tech stack is nothing short of phenomenal. You’ve created partnerships all along. Bringing a brand new vertical from zero to hero is something to be proud of, especially given that the impact of this work is now becoming visible externally from HelloFresh. As Monasin put it aptly during our AHM - it’s the first time in HelloFresh history that a commercial team admits openly “we need to catch up”. 

Good Chop: Tripling the size of your business, doesn’t come for granted. Though you did! Your fast pace, adaptiveness, and dedication made Good Chop into a brand which is larger than many of our international markets. You did this while tackling significant macro headwinds (inflation and customer behaviour changes) in a vertical, which is unknown to most customers. Moreover, the Good Chop brand and its technology have consistently been the innovation driver for the whole group with HelloFresh. What you have built has heavily influenced many global concepts, experiments, and experiences.

Pet Food: Launching a new brand (another new vertical!) and making it the fastest-growing new vertical in HelloFresh history is something that we didn’t dare to dream of when joining HelloFresh. Your contributions have played a pivotal role in positioning us in this market. and making a positive impact on pet nutrition in the US. That gave us strong conviction that you have the superpower to scale the business into new heights. Way to go!

X-Brand: The work done on X-Brand has been groundbreaking. It's a testament to your ability to push boundaries and embrace challenges. X-Brand is more than just a one-time project; it represents our collective force to pioneer and innovate and the first foray into moving HelloFresh from a mealkit business to a truly comprehensive food service provider for the households worldwide. 

After all, we know that it was not only easy-peasy. As a team, we reasonably debated green bananas, challenging deadlines, coming to the office, desk availability, and more. We highly appreciate the openness, controversies and candor each one of you has brought to the table. We felt that we matured as a team in several regards. We hope you feel so, too. Most of you joined us in 2021 or 2022. We went into 2023 with a shift from New Brands Retention to New Ventures as well as with some question marks. Now, it is one year later. We seem to have found a rhythm and better feeling of how to organize ourselves.

We are excited to onboard together with you into 2024. We wish you a wonderful Christmas time and a Happy New Year.

Nikita & Tobias

                                                                                    * We deployed a change to the TPT checkout on Wednesday that caused a critical, this only affected TPT as we’ve recently created a unique checkout page for TPT. Luckily this new page was only partially rolled out to our users and we were able to disable it quickly by turning off the feature flag on optimizely

                                                                                    * New requirements have been highlighted as blockers before launching Bulk Ordering Service. These include ensuring BOS can handle multiple delivery dates from ZipMap, and updating/cancelling of orders on Shopify. These use cases were less relevant when Shopify initially launched but have become growing issues in recent weeks. Once we finish our new spike by next week, we will give a new estimation for the delivery of the service.

                                                                                    * We finally managed to deploy our KStream application in staging after a long battle on how to connect to aiven using jvm 🙂

                                                                                    * Added new Backend Responder role in the team to handle alerts and external requests

We started with Ready-to-Eat first (a project led by Alex Harvey), by creating a map of some customer experiences associated metrics we could monitor. As part of this initiative we created 3 different HoneyComb triggers that create OpsGenie alerts that will let us know when we have a high number of client-side React errors (using Error Boundary metrics) in our RTE, NV and WL-MK brand families. The 3 alerts are linked to the New Brands Web OpsGenie team, and will be updated accordingly after the on-call split.

The problem broke the FAQ and Contact page of Factor US for almost two hours, affecting 370 users. Here’s a link to the postmortem. One of the most important action items is going to be an initiative to speed up the migration of our web codebase to Typescript 🙂

This was due to a migration that happened on Logistics side to move users to a new delivery option due to a new DC launch. Ahmed Wagdiand Suzanna Filipowskaquickly jumped on the issue and were able to mitigate it by manually reassigning users to the right cadence together with the Ops team.

                                                                                       * TPT Header: We worked on branching out from the unified header so that TPT has its own header to enable us to make custom changes specific to TPT quickly, e.g. Multi-pet profile switcher, adding Intake Quiz CTA, etc. Making good progress and will be completed in the next couple days.

                                                                                       * CVR Improvements: We’re working on enabling exit/entry intent pop-ups, and also added

                                                                                       * Since we are hitting B2S season, we wanted to ensure the FJ funnel is running optimally without any experience that would downgrade overall CR for our growth counterparts.

                                                                                       * Next steps:

                                                                                       * B2B Bulk Ordering service: This week the team came back to finalize the automated flow of Shopify <> Katana integration.

Next week, the team demos to Ed and sets up a presentation with static data. On the backend side, progress has been made implementing the /clone endpoint in Customer Management Service and calling downstream services (APIv2, Payments Token Service, Login) for the actual cloning. Given the remaining story points and observed pace, the final integration of frontend and backend seemed unlikely for CW32. Therefore, the release was pushed to CW33.

                                                                                                * Why build a new service? 

                                                                                                * The NV brands are constantly coming up against CRM issues involving missing or incorrect data. The main reason is because these brands have some unique data and features (delivery cadence, pet profile, trial box etc.) and these aren’t factored into the existing HF CRM events. Also it’s not recommended to fix these issues in the original CRM events since these events serve all brands inside the company and they’re meant to be generic. So instead we want to build a new service that triggers events with the specific data that the NV brands want

                                                                                                * We recently found out that several teams throughout HF (inside and outside of TAM) are interested in building some sort of profile service that’s meant to extend the customer in some way (E.g. a customer taste profile). Since we already have a similar use case implemented in TPT (nutritional-profile-service) we’ve reached out to try to come to one unified solution that everyone can use. This is still in the brainstorming phase but the goal is to allow us to collect more information about the customer beyond what is currently available in the customer object, and different services can get this information in order to improve the customer experience (e.g. personalize their recommendations)

Orders on July 4-6 were postponed to July 7 because of the 4th of July holiday using the holiday management tool.

Also, we think that launching the CRM campaign after July 4th would bring more attention to the offer!

Expose better cuts pre-checkout) to brainstorm on potential solutions and the tech limitations of each (workshop miro here)

                                                                                                * After a lot of back and forth, the team aligned with the customer plan squad on a sustainable solution for adding new data to our CRM events. We have created a miro board to show our options and an epic to groom what needs to be done. The next sprints will be fun :)

                                                                                                * As a temporary solution for having pet profile data in CRM, we started uploading the profiles daily as an CSV file in a google drive to CRM team. We are still finishing this as we need some approval from platform team

                                                                                                * Mori wrote a post-mortem for the first time in HelloFresh and of course it had to do with endless pause. After a lot of back and forth, it is ready to be merged, let's hope that he didn't give up on us and will show up next week

                                                                                                * We refined some of our alerts and shaped some runbooks to make the more stable

                                                                                                * The breed list inside the intake quiz (500+ breeds) is now searchable, so customers don’t have to scroll through 500 breeds to look for their dog. Phew!

                                                                                                * This sprint, we are working on an earlier creation of a pet profile - currently it’s created after the user has a subscription, we would like to create it after the user has an account. This would allow us to learn about the customer earlier and create a more personalized cart abandonment campaign to remind customers to complete their signup.

                                                                                                * Working on refining the docs and runbooks for the services we own to make them more accessible

This is taking us a bit of time because we’re dealing with things that we weren’t super familiar with, on the other hand this has been a good exercise in expanding our expertise in the CRM/commstech domain and the solution we’re working on should be useful in addressing several of our CRM needs, not just the TPT pet profiles.

The issue was fixed and all the data restored (it was transparent to our clients) but we still have to write a post mortem next sprint to learn from it

This refactoring will not only help the Health and Fitness initiative but also make things easier for CRM integration

TAM currently supports 13 different website domains, each one with their own set of Page Rules that implement CDN caching, redirections and proxies to S3. Adding a rule to start caching a new page requires modifying 13 different files. To solve this problem, we created a `whitelabel-rules` terraform module that contains all shared CloudFlare configuration. While moving CDN configs from each domain module to the shared module, we are also migrating Page Rules to their new and improved version: Cache Rules.

                                                                                                * This change will free up a significant amount of time for our B2B Sales and Customer Care teams, and reduce the number of issues related to meal selections.

Since yesterday morning we have CDN caching metrics of our HTML pages in all our frontend HoneyComb traces. Before, the only way to get some basic cache metrics was by going to CloudFlare’s dashboard and doing some low level queries. With the new HoneyComb data you can calculate cache hit ratio of any web page, and compare performance metrics between cached vs non-cached response - spoiler alert, the difference is huge! Below is the LCP of the whitelabel Plans page, where you can see the non-cached responses are 3 times slower than the cached ones. With this data, we hope that teams will take a look at their caching metrics and implement improvements.

                                                                                                         * As Good Chop was affected by the issue with price experiments, we have started getting on-boarded by the team coordinating the investigation. Desi will be working alongside Daniel on the WL side to do the root cause analysis. Once we have more understanding on what caused this issue we plan to relaunch our pricing test. Further information can be found in the post mortem.

                                                                                                         * This week we had an initial discussion to outline how we want to move forward with our tribe level KRs regarding latency and availability. We will start the investigation in the upcoming weeks.

                                                                                                         * Found an issue regarding clearing user’s one-off change when updating preference which affects trial-box. Workaround was implemented for TPT and there’s an ongoing discussion to make this change for all countries

By doing this, the config for the current country and environment is resolved in the server side instead of dynamically in the client side. Client-side dynamic resolutions of configs is bad because not only the React app will need to load a JS chunk that has the entire config object, the Config Provider will delay the rendering of its children to the client side, making the user experience much slower. We found more than 20 WL config projects that are not being correctly resolved on the server side: https://ui.honeycomb.io/hellofresh/datasets/traces-frontend-live/result/75wJVMh4EGS. We ask all teams to take a look at this list and fix them ASAP.

We found that the unified checkout header (checkout funnel breadcrumb header) release matches a decrease in page transition time (~300ms faster) when users go from the Signup to the Checkout page (HC query).

This approach might simplify the order processing flow and avoid mixing B2B and B2C customers and orders in HF systems.

                                                                                                               * By the second half of April, the investigation should be complete, and the team should have sufficient data to select the final direction for the service.

The next step is to start unifying the Sign Up page (see RFC)

                                                                                                               * In the last months we’ve been having some noise in Sentry related to a weird problem that sometimes happens when Google Translate is used in some versions of Chrome, breaking React’s virtual DOM (they wrapped translated content with <font> tags). This problem was mostly happening on our Image component, since NextJS is wrapping images with span tags. This week we wrapped the NextJS image component with an ErrorBoundary to reduce the blast radius of the problem, and to reduce the Sentry log level to warning. The root problem will be fixed with the NextJS 13 upgrade, but in the meantime we wanted to reduce the noise caused by it.

🎄🎄🎄 End-of-year Note🎄🎄🎄





Big congratulations everyone for making this year unbelievably successful! Thanks to your hard work, dedication and passion, this year has been a resounding success. The tribe achieved the lion’s share (89%!) of its OKRs with flying colors, innovated both within our domains (e.g. New Recipe Cards) but, crucially, also drove innovation across HelloTech (Staging for Non-Techies). If we look back at where the tribe started it would be hard to imagine how successful Good Chop would be by now, how easy to use and engaging would EveryPlate and Factor become for their customers. Even at the very last days of 2022 you managed to deliver huge improvements for our customers - Trial Box and Subscribable Add-ons. 





Thanks to your efforts we go into 2023 with incredibly ambitious goals that we know we will be able to achieve! We look forward to working side by side with you in the coming year and wish you Happy Holidays and a Happy New Year! 





Thank you,

Tobias & Nikita

This is a major milestone for us, since this new mobile flow has been one of the most successful experiments in the HelloFresh conversion side, and the unification allowed us to experiment this variation in whitelabel brands.

                                                                                                                     * We continue the experiment about preference selection layout (side-by-side vs below the fold). We don’t have significant data, yet, but anecdotal evidence for the existing layouts (including below the fold). We still hope for enough reasons to reduce the number of variations form three to two and to roll out the side-by-side layout.

We are 🤞that the side-by-side variation will win (or have no impact), allowing us to rollout the same selector layout in whitelabel and all HelloFresh countries.

Given the very complex voucher logic in both Whitelabel and HelloFresh applications, and the big differences between their logic, this is the only unified component that is not fully autonomous: the UI component is pretty dumb, and we have container components in HF and WL that implement most of the voucher validation and application logic.

Between HF and all whitelabel countries, we have 4 different components showing customer reviews, using 3 different data sources (RCS, Contentful & Trustpilot). Not only would we like to reduce the number of components we used for this purpose, we also want to have a single data source. We documented the different testimonial components we currently have, and assessed pros and cons of removing their content from Contentful/RCS and using the Trustpilot API instead (link to doc).

                                                                                                                        * We created our first pull request refactoring a HF Plans page component, replacing RCS toggles with the config lib, replacing usages of legacy APIs and migrating the files to Typescript - this is the type of improvements we want to do on the entire page, to modularize each section making it reusable to all brands.

The goal is looking for potential use cases we are still covering. After some initial work and POC, we are finally collecting it everyday inside one of web-infra’s cronjob. This data is currently available on a simple chart including every team with your own coverage percentage. The next step is creating more visualised data filtered only by the New Brands teams!

Each section will become a well-defined module that could be used in our whitelabel Plans page.

Since moving whitelabel-web to the web infra, we’ve been talking about sharing more and more code between HelloFresh and Whitelabel brands with the end goal of sharing customer flows. This project is a big step towards this goal: we plan to unify the Plans page. There are already a couple of other project with similar goals: frontend-infra is building a proof of concept of a unified Login page, and the New Brands Awareness squad has an epic on their backlog to migrate our Home page to use the Landing Pages system (HelloFresh is rolling this out).

The plan is to run this command every weekend and monitor the evolution of our test coverage metrics. The Frontend Infra squid got very excited about this new tool, and the idea is to start running for the entire codebase, tracking test coverage of all teams and not just New Brands.

                                                                                                                        * We need to gain more experience to build Visual Tests in a non-flaky way, i.e. get a better feeling for granularity and deviation tolerance.

                                                                                                                        * “Incident” is a process for escalation and getting attention. Definition of “critical” is a framework to allow everyone independently to decide on the urgency of an issue. When being on the fence, assume the higher criticality. There is nothing wrong with triggering a critical and concluding in hindsight that it was not critical. Failures, criticals, incidents, and post-mortems are a great source for learning, let’s embrace them, even if it feels sometimes like a “little too much process”.

We own four remaining Concourse pipelines to be migrated. nutrition-cards-cron is probably the most compex one. Fede is looking for people to pair. This is a chance to learn something and help us get rid of legacy.

                                                                                                                              * A recurrent problem we have is that HelloTech doesn’t have a good way to store technical metrics that could be used to track the progress of migrations or other technical initiatives in an automated way. Last month, Fede described this problem and proposed a solution in this RFC. This week a first proof of concept was implemented: a web toolbox command that exports pull request metadata from Github to a Google Spreadsheet. We will be implementing another toolbox command to do something similar with JIRA tickets, which we will eventually use to calculate Change Failure Rate by counting JIRA bug tickets and merged Pull Requests. This kind of tools open up a lot of possibilities, if you have an idea of something we could start tracking please let Fede know!

The problem was fixed after reverting a Soft Login change introduced the previous week. We already created a HoneyComb alert that would trigger when the number of newsletter un-subscriptions is below an abnormal threshold, and we will be implementing E2E tests to prevent this issue from happening again.

Then more GreenChef US-UK mixups were detected. The issue was caused by a GTM refactoring done by the frontend infra team, that mixed the GTM ids of both countries. A hotfix was released around 3am fixing the problem. More info on the incident’s channel: #in-17773-2202

Then we worked together on improving our existing `build-dependency-tree` toolbox command to sort page dependencies by the number of commits that change them - this will allow us to be more data-driven when prioritizing what dependencies should be refactored next.

💥 Critical Incident

On Monday morning we triggered a Critical Incident after seeing several problems with the Endless Pause endpoint used by Good Chop. After some investigation, we found that the problem was introduced on Thursday evening with some changes to the authentication library in frontend infra. The issue was fixed on Monday noon, and after that we had to manually fix the data of ~250 customers that had a weekly subscription due to this issue. There will be two post-mortems written, one by Frontend Infra and one by Vini’s team.

                                                                                                                              * The team started the first non Good Chop specific work in the squad, which is implementing a freebie slider for GreenChef instead of using our current pop up. The goal is to increase the take rate of the feature in both countries of the brand

                                                                                                                              * We are working on relaunching the pre-checkout selection experiment, by first bringing back our previous work and then adding some improvements to it so we can provide a better experience

By nudging users to their 2nd week and showing them how to start editing meals, we can  increase Meal Choice Rate for Box 2.

                                                                                                                              * The team is working towards fixing the Price Summary for multiple vouchers.

The new view mode will be rolled out to all brands on W07

This will prevent customers from getting the pre-selected default selection if they don’t perform a meal choice. 

                                                                                                                              * This week, we launched an AB on the dashboard. The control group will continue to see 1 delivery while the variation group will see up to 3 deliveries in the future and will be able to perform meal choice for them and reschedule them (when possible). 

                                                                                                                              * Last week’s achievement: 21% of acquired customers selected the L box, that’s a +61% L box TR increase compared to last week.

                                                                                                                              * Next week we will start working on a new experiment nudging customers to edit their second week.

Most of our tech initiatives from Q3/2021 are completed (kudos for everyone!). We still need to focus on measuring the success of some (e.g. Visual testing, E2E test improvement) and decided if the underlying issues were addressed. Overall we see increased code ownership and decisiveness about technical real estate since, which is great! 

                                                                                                                              * Fab4+ metrics exist now on Squad Level. Unfortunately, a tableau license is needed. Since we pay for Tableau per user, it doesn’t scale that everyone has a license just for obtaining Fab4+ metrics. For now, please discuss the Fab4+ metrics with your Squad Lead.

                                                                                                                              * The ​​Data Access in the Server Side RFC is finally complete, and the proposed solution has been implemented as a proof of        concept. Last week the background-data-refreshing was first used for HF Applanga translations, and after a few days without problems we rolled it out for RCS and Optimizely datafile. This morning during Chapter Day we had a session to explain how this solution works, and implemented it for Presets, Products and Contentful (whitelabel only). We expect to see an increase of service availability (less alerts) and a decrease in latency during off-hours (when people are mostly asleep, and cache hit ratio is normally down).

                                                                                                                              * The Enhance e2e tests initiative has been marked as complete after a lot of hard work (shoutout to Max and Bolo for leading it!). The last milestone was to write a document explaining our QA Strategy and how we do E2E testing with Cypress. Please check them out!

💻 Tech Initiatives

This week we completed two big tech initiatives:

                                                                                                                              * Terminate whitelabel-web service: after removing/migrated all endpoints in whitelabel-web, we were finally able to deprecate and terminate the service. We still have the whitelabel-web repo because there are a couple of concourse jobs in there that are still being used by us.

                                                                                                                              * Unbind dependencies: one big issue we started having after migrating to frontend infra is that our code had a lot of bad internal dependencies. This was causing some circular dependencies between packages, and it was slowing down the CI by running E2E tests that were not really needed. After extracting code to new libraries and removing some problematic import-export root files (icons, common components, store) we consider this initiative done. I will be sharing more info on this topic once we are all back in January.

Surcharge revenue (main metric for the test) increased for the variation where we increased $1 per serving, but further investigation showed that add-ons revenue and seamless revenue increased for the variation where we decreased $1 per serving, so they cancel each other out in the end.. As a next step we are awaiting feedback from Chefs Plate, as which version to roll out is highly depending on the local team’s strategy (i.e. whether to push for premium recipes or add-ons & seamless).

💥 Critical Incident

This morning at 5am we had a critical incident in our whitelabel web pages, caused by a latency spike in RCS. Even though the issue fixed itself after a few minutes, we still need to work on improving our resiliency on different levels: fallback RCS data when API is down (or any other type of data used by server), and improving CDN caching to return stale HTML pages when the service is down (currently implemented in most of our pages, but we still miss a couple of important ones). Here’s the link to the incident’s post mortem.

Quarterly Quality Review (QQR)

Last Friday we had our QQR for Q3 where Tobias, Ahmed and Alex presented to Yoav, Davor and Monasin what we achieved during the last quarter and some of the topics we want to tackle on Q4. If you haven’t done so yet, I recommend looking at the slides. In the next few weeks we will be discussing the goals and action items for Q4.

This is part of a bigger initiative to untangle the dependency between our packages. As part of this initiative, we also found some unused legacy code from our old routing system that was causing all whitelabel pages to indirectly depend on the rest of the pages. By removing this code, a change on a single page should only trigger the cypress tests on that page only, instead of running all our tests.

                                                                                                                              * After A-DOS worked on removing some 3rd party dependencies in our react-native app and converted the distributable file(s) from APK to AAB, he wrote a nice post in our HelloTech engineering blog.

                                                                                                                              * Next steps for the squad: investigate the effort to build a more robust pre-checkout cuts selection solution that would enable us provider users with a better user experience and drive higher AOV down the road.

In the next few days I will be drafting a RFC to migrate some of the existing endpoints by storing some static files in S3.

                                                                                                                              * The TestCafe to Cypress migration is almost done, with 88% of the tests already migrated.

After so many months of hard work, our web application is now living in the web repo along with part of the HelloFresh website. In the next few months we will be working on cleaning up some of the hacks we had to do to make things work, and start using some of the cool things web infra provides.

                                                                                                                              * We created a bunch of tech initiatives to be tackled in the next months, you can find them here: https://hellofresh.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SC/pages/1736639243/Tech+Initiatives . They include the Q3 QQR goals.

                                                                                                                              * Today we started with a new tech initiative: terminate whitelabel-web. In the Chapter Day we worked together to remove all the obsolete code that was migrated to the web infra. We cannot kill the service yet since we still have some APIs that are currently used, but by removing the unused code we are improving maintainability, performance and security of the service.

                                                                                                                              * The TAM Alliance tech leads meeting happened on Fri, 3.9.:

                                                                                                                              * The current implementation of Contentful is suboptimal in terms of robustness and scalability. Tobias is looking at it right now.

                                                                                                                              * Once the next release candidate is submitted, we will need to force update the Everyplate app to ensure all users exposed to Loyalty are able to use all functionalities.

                                                                                                                              * Early in the week we had a brainstorming session with the team and stakeholders to identify “how might we clarify what you get for the price”.

Every NextJS page component can define a list of endpoints that should be fetched, so the page can use the returned data to render the HTML. Every one of our pages need contentful data, products, preferences, optimizely datafile and RCS. The problem we had was that when going from one page to another, NextJS was fetching all this data over and over again making the page transition very slow. Yesterday we were able to merge a proof of concept fix, and this morning we released the fix to all whitelabel pages in web infra.

                                                                                                                              * Now that there are no outstanding issues that can block the migration, we will start testing our New Brands in the web infra. Of course we need to verify that all user flows are working as expected, but since our TestCafe tests are all passing against the web infra, we will need to pay extra attention to infrastructure topics that are not covered by our e2e tests. I created a list with these points, feel free to add anything that I might have missed. https://hellofresh.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SC/pages/2936569923/Testing+Plan

Vini investigated and it turns out we were not relying on the right source to know if a subscription had been created.

                                                                                                                              * Currently, the funnel is not performing well. This is likely due to a mix of several reasons, such as lack of online presence of the brand, lack of social proof, unclarity of customers around what they get. Val is currently analysing the results of 10 unmoderated user interviews focused on the funnel and the first logged-in experience, which will give us  more insights on how we can improve it.

We first stopped fetching customer+subscription data from the server, and since this morning we are no longer rendering different experiment variations on the server side. This only affects how we implement logged-out users experiments, since for logged-in users we never had server-side experimentation. The only logged-out user experiment that could be affected has been (Plans page in Factor, not launched yet) refactored to minimize the impact of this architecture change.

💥 Critical Incident

On Tuesday 08/06 the CDN provider Fastly had a major outage, causing Contentful (and half of the internet) to go down. Our website was mostly running ok during the incident (in-memory cache of contentful data), but our mobile apps were crashing for some users. Murtaza from the Mobile Apps team wrote a detailed postmortem of what happened and added action items to prevent another Contentful outage from crashing the apps. Please take some time to read it: https://github.com/hellofresh/post-mortems/tree/20210608-fastly-outage-cause-new-brands-app-crash/20210608-fastly-outage-cause-new-brands-app-crash

                                                                                                                                    * Yesterday Tobias and Solenne presented the last happiness survey results, and the team discussed some of the questions and their scores. Something to highlight is that the questions about internal team collaboration and integration had 100% positive sentiment, which is something really amazing to achieve during these times with remote working. On the lowlights we had the pride of working at HelloFresh. Please let us know what would make you more proud about your workplace.

                                                                                                                                    * Next Monday (May 24th) is a holiday in Berlin :)

It is very important that this date is met as the EveryPlate Ops team depends on us and add-ons are a must have for Factor launch in July.

The version we currently use is slow, and when we have components/hooks doing a lot of date calculations the app can become quite slow. After adding memoization to some date operations, the version we had in master became much faster. Because of this, we decided to merge back the BFF changes to master.

                                                                                                                                    * Most of the access control functions have been migrated. Our initial plan to finish this migration this week wasn’t achieved, since a lot of other more important things came up. Hopefully we will get this done next week.

                                                                                                                                    * After several weeks of scoping and researching, the Porterhouse team (Solenne, Vini and Diljohn) created their first sprint this week, and will start with the implementation.

                                                                                                                                    * We found a beautiful not too ugly solution on how to handle the 4 weekly delivery for Porterhouse, after lots of meetings with the delivery moments squad. Here is the POC that Vini created. 

                                                                                                                                    * We got results from the usability testing on the logged in area. Overall they are really good! See here. We will regroup with the design team on Monday to decide on how to adjust the dashboard 

                                                                                                                                    * Roland and Amanda are working on the theming and the funnel. 

                                                                                                                                    * Last but not least, the brand name will be chosen next week !! 

🏅 Mid-Year FOODIE Cycle

                                                                                                                                    * This week, emails were sent out to participants in the mid-year FOODIE cycle. In case you are a provider of feedback or you are participating, plan in sufficient time and space.

                                                                                                                                    * Due to big performance issues, we had to revert the BFF changes on the mobile app. We will start investigating and discussing different options on how to fix these problems so we can resume with the BFF migration.

                                                                                                                                    * We are halfway done with the Access Control migration and should be done with it by the end of next week.

                                                                                                                                    * Pep made a lot of progress on the web (infra) repo, and already has a few funnel pages working, including brand theming. Yesterday he gave a presentation of what he achieved and how. Here’s a document he wrote on how does the web<->whitelabel-web integration works: https://github.com/hellofresh/web/blob/master/app/spaces/whitelabel/README.md





🏆 Loyalty Challenge

We started with the implementation of the Loyalty Challenge on our mobile app. We already have the navigation item and the bare-bones screen, enabled only in ER staging. We are now implementing a component that will show in the Home Feed, that will prompt the user to go to the Challenge screen.

Arbaaz joins the Engagement team as a frontend engineer, and Suzanna will join us as a frontend intern. Please give them a warm welcome and support their onboarding as much as you can.

                                                                                                                                    * Some of us joined the mob programming workshop with Woody Zuill.

Yesterday a big PR in whitelabel-web was merged, doing a massive cleanup of the legacy menu code.

                                                                                                                                    * This week we migrated the access control function of the Refer a Friend page, and we are currently working on migrating the Cancellation and Delivery Tracking page.

💸 Additional Vouchers

We are still working on fixing the price calculation of surcharge discounts for future weeks (next modifiable week works well) on web, and then we will replicate the changes on mobile.

🚀 PorterHouse

Next sprint, the development work for PorterHouse will kick off with Vini and Diljohn joining the PorterHouse Tiger team. A proof of concept for monthly delivery was shared.

The user research for the PorterHouse logged in area is also kicked off (see video attached). 

Next week we will have some meetings with the HelloFresh teams to clarify the implementation of the monthly delivery and the physical incentives for vouchers.

🛣️ Q2+Q3 Roadmap

Solenne, Ahmed, Tobias and I sat down and put our planned projects into a roadmap for Q2 and Q3. Tobias and Solenne presented this roadmap to Yoav and Annie and received good feedback about it. In the second tab of the spreadsheet we listed the priorities, with Porterhouse leading the list. Whenever we have to make a hard choice between two deliveries, we will decide for the one with the higher priority. That makes projects with lower priority more likely to be delayed than the ones with higher priority. If you have any concern of a high-priority project, please let Tobias and Solenne know as soon as possible.

We can expect the initiative to be complete early next week. There are still some cleaning up to do on web and mobile.

                                                                                                                                    * Last week we implemented a proof of concept of how we can migrate route access control to react components, and this we started with the migration of the access control function for the Cancellation page. By the end of next week, we should have also migrated the Delivery Tracking and RaF routes.

💸 Additional Vouchers

One of Engagement's sprint goals is to support Additional Vouchers in our price calculation logic for web and mobile. This week we started working on the website, refactoring the voucher Redux logic (🍝) and implementing the action to fetch a subscription's additional voucher info.

🔪 Killing Alice

This week we removed the last API call to Alice: update payment method in web. Before Alice is really killed in Intfood (expected mid April), we will need to do a force update of our mobile app to prevent users from using old versions that are still using the old endpoints.

🛒 Add-ons

The Happiness team started to implement some changes for Add-Ons, and was able to setup some add-ons SKUs in staging.

Meeting records Recording 





Summary

Nikita Gorshkov and Prateek Jajoo discussed content strategy and app development, acknowledging a weak history in content but recognizing the potential of an app to measure and communicate pet health improvements to users, with the goal of improving social proof and retention. They agreed on the need to define the smallest possible product and to test ideas by understanding pet owners' top worries through a survey, which Nikita Gorshkov confirmed the commercial team can easily incorporate into existing surveys. Prateek Jajoo inquired about the power user demographics, whom Nikita Gorshkov identified as "dinks" in metro areas, with high annual spending on their pets.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Content Strategy and App Development Nikita Gorshkov noted the company's weak history in content strategies and daily active user increases, which makes them cautious about investing heavily in content, despite recognizing the interest. They suggested finding easy ways to show users that their products improve pet health, which can then be used as social proof on the website. Prateek Jajoo connected this idea to the potential basis for a pet app, which Nikita Gorshkov affirmed could be a strong idea.

* Testing Ideas and Customer Concerns Nikita Gorshkov emphasized the need to define the smallest possible product and, more importantly, to test interesting ideas to build confidence before committing significant resources. Prateek Jajoo suggested understanding the top five worries or thoughts a pet owner has about their pet to ensure that any app features or solutions address what customers truly care about, thus driving daily usage and engagement. Nikita Gorshkov agreed that providing basic tracking capabilities should be offered not only to active customers but potentially to any pet owners who download the app.

* Surveying Pet Owners To understand customer thoughts, Prateek Jajoo suggested running a survey. Nikita Gorshkov confirmed that the commercial team already runs a survey every two weeks or monthly, and it would be easy to add additional questions due to a good response rate. They shared the contact of Lindsay within the TPT team, who typically runs these in-depth surveys, and offered to add Prateek Jajoo for visibility, mentioning that the latest one they had access to was from August.

* Target Customer Demographics and Spending Prateek Jajoo inquired about the demographics of the power user customer. Nikita Gorshkov identified the power users as "dinks" (Dual Income, No Kids) in metro areas, who have the time, energy, and desire to pamper their pets with fresh frozen food, considering the increase in dog ownership and the perception of pets as children. Nikita Gorshkov noted that the average spend in the US per dog is $1.6k per year, emphasizing that this is a lot of money and the highest amount globally.

* Customer Connection and Health Measurement Prateek Jajoo discussed the emotional attachment and time spent with a dog, suggesting owners would notice improvements in health or appearance, but proposed that the company should help measure and communicate those improvements rather than waiting for the customer to figure it out. Nikita Gorshkov agreed with the sentiment and suggested that Prateek Jajoo speak with Yara, who owns a dog named Boba and represents a good middle ground for their target audience, as she ensures their pet is healthy and happy. Prateek Jajoo connected this idea of measuring and communicating health improvements to solving the retention problem, comparing it to the high utility of services like Amazon Prime.

* Next Steps and Design Bandwidth Prateek Jajoo stated that they would start working on the login page and write a one-pager for review to plan stage one and stage two for a quick win within one sprint. Prateek Jajoo expressed concern about Katrina's bandwidth for the design work. Nikita Gorshkov confirmed they are working to ensure Katrina has the necessary bandwidth and is pushing back on distractions from their senior director.





Suggested next steps

* Prateek Jajoo will start work on the login page and write a one-pager to review and make stage one and stage two plans for a quick win within one sprint.

* Nikita Gorshkov will help Prateek Jajoo navigate where to find the survey and related information by sending the contact for Lindsay and adding Prateek Jajoo to the TPT team for visibility on the surveys.

* Prateek Jajoo will work with the designer Katrina to ensure the right questions are being asked in the survey to get the right information.

* Nikita Gorshkov will ensure that Katrina has the bandwidth for the design work.
