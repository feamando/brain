,

,Q1 capitalization audit

,Please follow the instructions below 

Step 1,Go to the tab of your respective alliance

Step 2,"Verify Column G - Finance/Portfolio Decision , for the final decision on Capitalisation of the KR."

,"If you want to challenge this decision, please change Column H - Do you want to challenge the decision? to Yes. Provide supporting commentary in Column I - Comment."

Step 3,Verify Column J - Check Questions to understand which question you need to answer:

,A - Provide evidence this KR results in the creation of assets in Column I - Comment.

,"B - Check column L - B. Does the KR result in economic benefit?

If the cell is highlighted with ‘Oops, there is no YP strategy provided for this KR’  you need to provide the YP/QAR strategy this KR is associated with on the OKR Management Tool - Column AP (Input - Tech Strategy) or you need to explain why this KR is associated with a strategy with an economic benefit.

If the cell is highlighted with ‘This KR is associated with KTLO but we believe it delivers benefit and results in the creation of assets. Please advise',  you need to help us map this KR to an economic benefit.

If the cell is highlighted with ‘KR not found on the OKR Tool’, please help us map days reported to another KR."

,"C - Change value in column M - C. Percentage of work reported in cap activities YTD that is actually capitalisable if the KR is set to not meet or canceled, if it is partially capitalisable, or if there is need to ensure teams are not reporting non-capitalisable activities.

You can also use this column to correct the number of capitalisable days if there were mistakes in the reporting during the previous months (see FAQ 3 for more details)."

,"If the column is “-” there are no open question to address and if there are more than one item (i.e. B, C) please address both questions."

[l]OH MY THIS IS NICE! :)

[m]let's discuss in our 1:1 this week then briefly but my take on focus first would be on getting value out of it first then deciding if that value's worth keeping or moving over to an alternative product

[n]For which team? Consumer? Yarra and Abdel? (there's lots of taste profile teams haha

[o]@priscila.machado@hellofresh.com

[p]What's missing here?

[q]Out of curiosity, how often do we need to do competitive analysis?

[r]If we think this is really important I would DM people asking if they have something to share. If yes why they are not sharing it. Historically, I had way more survey answers when messaging people direct and trying to figure out why they where not answering it.

[s]Could we have access to the files @ekar@hellofresh.com ?

﻿PRD

Product Requirements Document (PRD): Cancellation Funnel Unification

1. Overview & Purpose

This PRD outlines the requirements for unifying the cancellation funnels across all HelloFresh Group brands. The primary goal is to leverage the existing HelloFresh cancellation funnel, including its deflection strategies and cancellation survey, and apply it to the remaining RTE, meal kit and new venture brands. This initiative aims to standardize the cancellation experience, improve customer retention for Factor and other brands, and streamline operational and technical maintenance. Depending on the engineering complexity, we consider two possible rollout scenarios:

1. [preferred] A/B test for all brands excl. Hellofresh, with control = BAU and variation = complete unified funnel. Alternatively, the test can target Factor US customers only.

2. Roll out without an A/B test, with the pre-post performance analysis

Decision about the prioritised rollout scenario will be taken by Karolina Zak/Edward Day once the effort estimation is known.

2. Goals & Non-Goals

Goals:

1. Use Hellofresh Cancellation Funnel UX in the remaining brands: Replicate the proven HelloFresh cancellation flow UX, including deflections and feedback collection, onto the other brands (all meal-kit, all RTE, The PetsTable, GoodChop, Factor Form, ?Factor Programs?[a][b][c][d]).

   1. !! This requirement does not mean using Hellofresh funnel code across brands. The initial engineering proposal is to create a new cancellation funnel module and move the Hellofresh flow pieces into this new cross-brand funnel. Once this is setup we can migrate the funnels to use this new app

2. Easy handling of all funnel variations: all the existing cancellation funnel variations (BAU flow, one-step funnel, one-click funnel, French adjusted funnel) need to be handled in a scalable way and allow reusing existing flows in other brands and markets

3. Standardize Cancellation Surveys: Implement the HelloFresh cancellation survey framework for other brands to gather consistent customer feedback on reasons for cancellation.

4. Unify Deflection Strategies: Make all existing deflection mechanisms available for use (not necessarily enabled) in all other brands cancellation funnels, including:

   1. Special deflections offered in a dedicated page sections:

      1. Benefits of keeping the subscription active (available discounts & credits, loyalty program status) → do not show if a customer doesn’t have a discount nor credit nor loyalty program status

      2. Switch to other brand (offered post cancellation) → Removed from the initiative scope. Remember to keep it live for Hellofresh brand.

   2. Regular deflections offered in small modular boxes:

      1. Offer new discount - Emmanuelle Hazeauxto clarify the ownership of the voucher creation for all brands and markets → changed from special deflection to the regular module - needs small design change

      2. Change plan frequency → links to the second step of the deflection, where customers can select alternative plan frequency

      3. Change plan size → there’s no price information, it has one of the lowest deflection rates. Therefore in the new funnel we want to send customers directly to the subscription settings page (!different links for different brands: HF /account-settings/subscription-settings, Factor /settings/plan/plan-selection)

      4. Help me skip → change to “Skip instead of cancel”, redirect to the homepage/single week page with a simple onboarding about using “Edit delivery” feature (only if skipping CTA is hidden

... [TRUNCATED: 15540 chars omitted to save context] ...

l not support having an active RTE subscription without an active meal kit subscription so for launch we added an "orchestration layer" that cancels the RTE subscription when the meal kit subscription is cancelled

[p]@nikita.gorshkov@hellofresh.com @kza@hellofresh.com It's not clear to me what consequences this project has for analytics - are cancellation metrics and GA events already aligned cross-brand or would we have to shake up our events and reporting as part of this push?





How about dashboarding?

[q]+ revisit the cancellation dashboard

[r]I think this needs to be investigated a bit further, but general cancellation metrics should be unified overal (at least looking at Tableau as the SoT here). Of course, cancellation reason-level reporting is different.

[s]what about Voice of customer team, should we we consider them as dependencies as they are the primary users of the cancellation survey results, maybe we need to check how it would impact them

[t]Who would be your primary contact for this team?

[u]@juan.hernandez@hellofresh.com

[v]@kza@hellofresh.com my read from this is that we don't make any changes to the BAU survey experience for any brand/market other than maybe the UI - am I right in this?

[w]Hey team, hope you're doing well and thanks for flagging @ehaz@hellofresh.co. I assume that from our end there is no big change as we only send the comments to Chattermill. Not sure if this would affect more the existing categories in Cancellation data sets, so I'll add @winnie.huang@hellofresh.com to the conversation

[x]Q on my side - how do we ensure market level compliance?

[y]what do you mean by compliance? Compliance to regulations?

[z]Yes cancellation tends to be regulated at a local level.





On top of legal compliance, I wonder if there are non-legal decisions we've taken at a local level that we also should look to preserve

[aa]Q2: Governance - the ability to change survey & deflections by brand/market will only be available to the owning _technical_ team right? We have no requirements to enable other stakeholders to modify this?

[ab]If so, it means owning tech team owns final decision on local setups (with local input) due to balancing capacity

[ac]i don't know why i imagined green chef being also sustainable so i'm curious why is not there today

Problem Statement

Social media has become a primary hub for culinary inspiration, where people turn to influencers to discover new recipes. While Followers struggle to find the necessary ingredients and an easy way to re-cook them, Influencers look for new revenue streams to be more independent from the heavily controlled platforms and find new ways to expand their reach and engage with their audiences authentically and organically via food.





Opportunity:

Hellofresh sees a huge opportunity to serve both: by transforming influencers' inspiration (recipe) into a shoppable, cookable meal kit for the consumers. 

By bridging the gap as the Expert in operation, warehouses and logistics, we provide customers a way to enjoy these recipes easily and the influencer to serve their followers and create a new revenue stream. The social commerce market is growing rapidly and can represent a huge opportunity for us to attract new customers.





Why now:

We see the urgency to act now, because influencers are already trying to solve this problem with links to ingredient orders  via Instacart or Pinterest partners with Instacart to enable 1-click grocery list generation from saved pins. But today, shoppable content on social media within the food category is often limited to individual food items as opposed to a holistic offering where the ingredients for entire recipes and direct delivery can be purchased. 





The Core Ask 

WBD: Influencer Marketplace

Explore desired and viable vision for a curated recipe creator marketplace (1. influencer, 2. Aggregators) with the option of an  instant purchase as a meal kit ‘fulfilled by HelloFresh’.





Long-term Vision (Later) 

Transform HelloFresh into the “Spotify for food”  a platform where any creator can share a recipe that HelloFresh fulfills.

Link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12VI1hXX5o-5Nr9IhdmYfYH8zNsu0wK1p-oA-wMylEBU/edit?usp=drivesdk
----------------------------------------

Purpose,

,Overview of the Product & Engineering organization and members of the Consumer mega alliance. Complementing the limited views from workday and adaptive.

Context,

,The actual source of truth remains Workday for all employee data and reporting lines

,"In many cases managers have to have a way to plan ahead, to get an overview over a larger part of the org, to add more data like what programming languages someone can contribute in or a logical grouoping by triebs and squads. To avoid that everyone has to do the same work and to keep track of relevant metrics we maintain this central sheet for the whole alliance (Product, engineering)."

,The sheet is only shared with CS8+ managers. 

,For questions contact Holger Hammel

Main sheet - CMA,

,Please always use Filter views

,"CS8+ Tribe leads are responsible to keep the sheet up to date. This includes timely updates to status, dates of contract changes, reporting & squad assignments"

,TBD: how to sync and spot conflicts btw workday and adaptive and this sheet

,

(Dont change) Squad,

,"As indicated in the tab name, this view show the assignment of employees to squads."

,"The view is generated fromt the data in CMA, so please don't change any values"

(Copy to Overview)  Squads,

,Use this tab to COPY UNLINKED to other documents like Consumer Mega Alliance - Overview

Don't show in Squad view,

,"Set this checkbox to true if the person should not appear in the squad overview views. An example is if someone is on garden leave, then they would still appear in the list, but are not technically working in the squad anymore."

Values ...,

,Value Tabs are holding the values for dropdowns in CMA.

,"Adding or changing values impact those dropdowns and the validation, "

,"If a value has to change, e.g. a new squad or change of name, then change it here, and not on the dropdown fields in CMA"

Pivot,

,Various Pivot tables for analytics on the CMA data. 

,If you want to add new Pivots for a tribe etc please add a tab with preix Pivot:

New Ventures Operational Overhead calculation



"How it works

This sheet provides the percentage of operational overhead (i.e. KTLO work per month). Each team has a dedicated tab. For this to work, you need to
* add the label KTLO to all Jira tickets that you consider KTLO work
* Make sure all tickets that move into the “resolved” state have assigned story points. Add the actual story point in hindsight for accurate operational overhead calculation
A cron job runs every night and updates this sheet. It used the resolved date to include a ticket in the calculation for a specific month.

### EMAIL: Leadership Updates: New Chapters for ANZ, Northern Europe, and Strategy & Spec Ops
ID: 19b213eca9da5c4d
From: Ed Boyes <ed@hellofresh.com>
----------------------------------------

Hi Team,



We are writing today to share important news regarding three key leadership

transitions.



1. ANZ Leadership



After a phenomenal 14-year tenure, Tom Rutledge has decided to step away

from the business, effective July 1, 2026. Tom has made an immense

contribution to HelloFresh, building up our ANZ business from scratch - all

the way from delivering the first few HelloFresh orders in Australia to

building a multi-region, multi-vertical $900mm business. What a journey!

While Tom will remain with us to run the business for several more months,

we want to acknowledge his immense contribution to HelloFresh - thank you,

Tom!



We are pleased to announce that Pauwel Wiertsema will take over as the new

ANZ CEO. Pauwel has been a HelloFresh leader since 2016, driving success as

CEO of Benelux and later Northern Europe. He will relocate to Sydney in

April 2026 to ensure a thorough handover with Tom.



2. Northern Europe



With Pauwel moving to ANZ, Guillaume Neu will be stepping into the role of

Managing Director, Northern Europe. Since joining us in 2022, as VP Global

Strategy & Special Operations, Guillaume has been at the forefront of

driving significant transformation and strategic initiatives across the

group, including the set-up and coordination of our group-wide efficiency

program. We are confident his strategic rigor will help our Northern Europe

markets continue to grow.



3. Strategy & Special Ops



As Guillaume transitions into his new ro

Please join us in congratulating Pauwel and Guillaume on their new roles,

and thanking Tom for his exceptional leadership.
