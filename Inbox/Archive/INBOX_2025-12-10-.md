Summary

Alison Ryan provided updates on the Shopify project for VMS, noting strong collaboration with Laura, Samir, and the Netta team as the launch approaches and key Recharge issues are resolved, which will simplify future projects like Good Chop; Nikita Gorshkov connected with Samir, who also feels they are in the final stages. Alison Ryan and Nikita Gorshkov discussed the Good Chop contracts, with Alison Ryan clarifying that the Recharge partnership was introduced but the contracts are still undergoing legal review, a process Yuri posted that procurement approved to fast track. Finally, Alison Ryan asked Nikita Gorshkov about the New York office check-in process for an upcoming trip, to which Nikita Gorshkov advised "bugging Ashling" for access information.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Project Updates and Collaboration Alison Ryan provided updates on the Shopify project, expressing enjoyment in working with Laura and Samir and noting strong collaboration with the Netta team. They reported that things are moving well, with the launch date approaching, and key issues like those related to Recharge are being sorted out, which will make future projects like Good Chop more straightforward. Nikita Gorshkov mentioned having connected with Samir, who also feels they are in the final stretches for Shopify for VMS and anticipates a quick turnaround for the Good Chop side now that the process is understood.

* Good Chop Contracts and Legal Review Nikita Gorshkov followed up on the status of the Good Chop contracts, questioning if the team had signed them. Alison Ryan clarified that an introduction was done with Recharge as a partner, but not with the Anetta team, and they understood that the contracts have not been fully signed yet. Alison Ryan shared that Yuri posted in the Good Chop channel that procurement gave an "okay" to fast lane the legal side, suggesting the contracts are currently undergoing legal review. Nikita Gorshkov planned to follow up with Yuri and Seb regarding the contracts.

* Upcoming Trip to the New York Office Alison Ryan is set up for a trip to New York next week and is excited to meet the Good Chop team and represent their project well for Shopify decisions. They asked Nikita Gorshkov about the check-in process for the New York office since they have never been there. Nikita Gorshkov advised that they would "bug Ashling" for office access information, suggesting that Ashling likely knows the policies and the people who need to issue codes and necessary items.





Suggested next steps

* Alison Ryan will contact Ashling to inquire about US office access, including necessary codes and policies, for the New York trip next week.

* Nikita Gorshkov will follow up with Yuri and Seb regarding the contract signing for Shopify for VMS.

* Personal Updates and Physical Activity Nikita Gorshkov shared that they had a good week and managed to run their fastest 10k in the last two to three years, attributing this partly to new Adidas Aero Evo SL sneakers. Sameer Doda expressed interest in looking into the sneakers, as they plan to start running soon, although they previously had not spent time running (00:00:00). Sameer Doda also mentioned their love for swimming and prior cycling experience, but noted that running would be a new endeavor (00:01:18).

* Project Updates and Resource Allocation Sameer Doda informed Nikita Gorshkov that Leman would be out for the remainder of the year and that a request to carry over some of Leman's additional days was not possible (00:01:18). Sameer Doda has requested that Van sync with DA to explore securing additional backend engineering resources for the project. The main project threads include the payments token, for which a draft PR is awaiting review from the payments team, and the account creation process, which still needs work with the relevant teams. A new third task involves automatically pausing new HelloFresh accounts for the first two to three weeks, requiring a back-end solution for bulk pausing (00:02:21).

* Phase Two and Migration of Credits Sameer Doda is scheduled to meet with Yolanta and Shay to discuss the phase two designs and gather front-end estimation of the work. Sameer Doda plans to contact the payments team again this week to finalize an approach for the migration of credits, an action that they need to coordinate and ensure is completed on time (00:03:14). Sameer Doda informed Jonathan and Terra from the local teams that an ETA on timelines would be provided in January, which they accepted (00:04:14).

* Influencer Marketplace and Internal Positioning Sameer Doda mentioned they are working on a complete mirror board with customer journeys and wireframes for the influencer marketplace to facilitate alignment with senior stakeholders. Sameer Doda also intends to sync with Dio regarding the status of the voucher application for one-time purchases (00:04:14). Nikita Gorshkov encouraged Sameer Doda to build rapport with Ian, as Nikita Gorshkov is attempting to position Ian to act as an "arbiter" for bigger initiatives, helping to push ED toward them and manage market pressure (00:05:14).

* Shopify Migration and Good Chop Strategy The Shopify migration for re-factor form is going well, and the team is almost finished. Sameer Doda is optimistic that the subsequent migration for good chop will be much quic

anging approach this year is because it's going to be the first Christmas with the baby and so I just wanted to not have to just be disconnected and just enjoy the end of

Nikita Gorshkov: Okay. Yeah. Fair. Fair enough.

Sameer Doda: the year with the baby. So that that's the reason why I changed my approach for now two months tomorrow.

Nikita Gorshkov: I get that. How old is yours right now? Two months tomorrow. Nice. We're going to be one month on Friday.

Sameer Doda: Yeah. One month on Friday. Yeah. We've got to take him for his vaccination tomorrow. So, I'm not sure how he's going to react, but fingers crossed.

 

 

00:11:18

 

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah. Fair. Fair.

Sameer Doda: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: All right. Uh oh, and we have our um hipbone scan uh on Thursday.

Sameer Doda: What's that? It's not something that happens in in Canada.

Nikita Gorshkov: Uh basically like in so what they do is they uh check if the hips are developing correctly so that uh like you don't need additional braces and stuff like that as early as possible. uh that you know they're in the right positions and doing all the stuff. And that's essentially it.

Sameer Doda: Oh, that's interesting because it's it's a big difference. Uh if it's something that's done there and it's not even talked about in in Canada. Uh, I'll if it's a thing in Europe, I'll probably ask my pediatrician because she used to work in the UK, so she might have I mean she might remember it from her days in UK, but I

Nikita Gorshkov: Uh ask ask if it makes sense. Like at least in Germany this is a thing. We had a couple of friends who had to had have braces. I think in the past uh what was done is when they wrapped all of the people so f****** tightly that so that that made the the legs straight.

Sameer Doda: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: Uh now they just do uh sort of a scan that uh everything's fine.

Sameer Doda: Yeah, my mom my mom keeps on telling me that you need to tie his legs as well, which we which we never did. Um, but yeah, you're right. Maybe that's the reason. It's it's just a traditional knowledge that our parents had, which we don't have anymore and we opt for these fancy new swaddles that don't have the same effect. Yeah.

Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Nikita Gorshkov and Jama Musse discussed several key organizational and project updates, including Tishia’s secured budget approval and Jama Musse's approval for an 18-month analytics support contract role, separate from a permanent product role, while also addressing Alexia's contract inquiry and the unexpected termination of Sharief following a mistake by his manager, Assaf. Discussions also covered David's anticipated departure during the reorg, concerns about Katrina's aggressive pursuit of a VP promotion, and the January 5th launch of the OTP plus subscribe and save feature for factor 4, along with vendor management issues regarding Anata attempting to offload subscription setup work onto Samir. Other topics included the prioritization of the Ed roadmap, where Jama Musse explained Ed's escalating pressure to meet market demands, and the critical need for B2B product support to address HIPPA compliance issues related to "factor food as medicine stuff."

Notes Length: Standard

* Staffing and Contract Roles Nikita Gorshkov confirmed that budget approvals for Tishia were secured from Lauron and Yuri. Following this, Nikita Gorshkov asked Jama Musse if they could proceed with an 18-month contract, similar to Yara's, for an analytics support role, which Jama Musse approved, stating "Let's do it". Jama Musse clarified that two separate roles are opening: a contract role and a permanent, full-time product role, emphasizing they are different functions and everyone needs to be aware (00:01:07).

* Follow-up with Alexia and Sharief's Departure Jama Musse instructed Nikita Gorshkov to close the loop with Alexia regarding the contract role, as themself had sent an inquiry while Jama Musse was on vacation. The speakers then discussed Sharief's unexpected departure, with Jama Musse explaining that Sharief’s manager, Assaf, was unhappy with Sharief and subsequently made a mistake that created an issue for the organization, which led to Sharief's termination to "solve the trouble problem" (00:02:02). Jama Musse suggested that Sharief was likely okay with the outcome, preferring to be "paid to leave versus to just quit," given the difficult relationship with Assaf (00:04:25).

* David's Departure and Reorganization The conversation shifted to David, with Jama Musse noting that David had slowed down over the last year, particularly after having a baby, but still expected top performer treatment during the reorg (00:05:57). Nikita Gorshkov noted that it was understandable if it was time for David to part ways after five and a half years (00:06:43). The speakers also addressed the "problem with Marlene" that Katrina was causing, with Jama Musse warning Nikita Gorshkov to watch out for Katrina, who is aggressively seeking a VP promotion and causing "spin" for the team by trying to reinstitute Dominic reviews for more FaceTime with Dominic (00:07:37).

* Product Launch and Vendor Management Nikita Gorshkov provided an update that the OTP plus subscribe and save feature for factor 4 is scheduled to launch on January 5th (calendar week two) to align with the expected pickup in peak traffic (00:09:35). Jama Musse and Nikita Gorshkov discussed the Shopify project, where Nikita Gorshkov expressed satisfaction with Allison's performance but noted that Anata, the consultancy being paid $400,000, was attempting to offload some of the subscription setup work onto Samir, which Nikita Gorshkov insis

Nikita Gorshkov: 996.

Jama Musse: too." There

Nikita Gorshkov: Yes. 996. Uh, shareholder f****** value. Um, this is what I wish for Christmas.

Jama Musse: you go.

Nikita Gorshkov: Um, cool.

Jama Musse: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: You had the last topic for one minute. I have my next Mhm.

Jama Musse: Yeah. So, so I don't know how to handle this.

 

 

00:18:38

 

Jama Musse: I'm just bringing it to your radar, but um they want some product support from us on the B2B side. they are running into some hiccups in like with things like HIPPA compliance and things of that nature with the work that they're trying to do on the the factor food as medicine stuff and like the the selling the food into like the old age homes and things that they're trying to do in the B2B space.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yes. Yep.

Jama Musse: And so apparently because our products don't have we don't we're not listing the right type of information in order to meet HIPPA compliance.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah.

Jama Musse: We have to do something about it. They don't know what they have to do yet and they don't know the how. But like they're now panicking and they reached out to me and they're like HIPPA compliance like so we need I think we just need to sit down with them and understand what they need. I'm not saying we deliver it because we don't have a team to deliver it. But like the first step is like figure out what's going on, which I don't think they they know.

Nikita Gorshkov: But okay, sounds good. That's what she was referring to. Okay. Um, my question is, can't they consolidate this?

Jama Musse: Who's she? Who's she? Who's the she when you said that?

Nikita Gorshkov: Elena. Elena.

Jama Musse: No. No. This is a completely different. So this is on the other side with Adam Park and um Kieran.

Nikita Gorshkov: Oh, okay.

Jama Musse: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: Okay.

Jama Musse: Anyway, I gota I gotta jump.

Nikita Gorshkov: Okay. Okay. So, just FYI, uh, in regards to that, don't they have Shopify? So, can't we modify the PDP so it it does include all the s***?

Summary

Nikita Gorshkov provided updates on PA support, noting Simon's increased visibility and contingent interviews with five independent contractors, while Maria Chelminska confirmed Tishia would be dedicated to TPT, Good Job, and VMS if hired. Maria Chelminska is working on business cases to provide evidence for OKR numbers, with Nikita Gorshkov emphasizing CVA impact over strict numerical accuracy, and Maria Chelminska expecting to understand overall goal achievement by the end of the current week. Maria Chelminska raised the long time to significance for experiments, with Farane suggesting the use of leading indicators or micro conversions to shorten this time, which Maria Chelminska noted would require more PA support and could face pushback, but Nikita Gorshkov agreed it makes sense for small experiments. Maria Chelminska stressed the need for an analyst to translate micro conversion impact to key metrics, but Nikita Gorshkov suggested focusing on overall business numbers like net revenue, AOU, and weekly active users, making assumptions about correlations between metrics.

Notes Length: Standard

* Staffing and PA Support Updates Nikita Gorshkov provided an update on the PA front, noting that Simon, a senior, in-house FT PA, is becoming more visible after onboarding, with Eva having shielded them from direct interaction. They are also speaking with Tishia to finalize budget matters, and have five independent contractors lined up for interviews as a contingency. Maria Chelminska confirmed that Tishia, if hired, would be dedicated to TPT, Good Job, and VMS.

* OKR Tracking and CVA Impact Nikita Gorshkov emphasized focusing on achieving CVA impact rather than strict OKR numbers, stating that the numerical accuracy can be within a range of plus or minus 25% to 50%. Maria Chelminska is still working to look into things, run business cases, and provide evidence for the numbers, noting that the first CVR initiative was achieved months ago. Maria Chelminska expects to have a good understanding of whether the overall goal is achieved by the end of the current week by calculating the impact of the most valid launches.

* Experimentation and Shortening Time to Significance Maria Chelminska raised the issue of experimentation, noting that they discussed with Farane, Alex's manager, the current challenge of waiting six to eight weeks to reach significance for experiments. The interaction effects initially explored do not solve the problem of long allocation time to experiments. Farane suggested focusing on potential levers to shorten this time, primarily by using leading indicators or micro conversions as the main metric instead of, for example, CVR improvement, which would make the Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) easier to detect.

* Implementation of Micro Conversions and Potential Pushback Maria Chelminska noted that implementing micro conversions would require more PA support to set up the new metrics in static, which they have not done before. They also cautioned that micro conversions cannot always be used, citing price testing as an example where the impact affects the entire funnel, and they expect pushback on this approach. Nikita Gorshkov agreed that not all experiments are equal; critical experiments still need the actual conversion rate or revenue data, but for small experiments with high confidence and relatively small impact, focusing on the micro conversion at that step makes sense.

* Connecting Micro Conversions to Business Outcomes Maria Chelminska emphasized the need for an analyst to translate the impact of micro conversions into expected CVR or other key metric impacts, noting that a percentage increase in a micro conversion doesn't directly translate to the same increase in the overall conversion rate. Nikita Gorshkov suggested taking a step back and focusing on the overall business numbers, such as net revenue, AOU, and weekly active users, making the assumption that if, for example, they decrease cancellation rates, it should correlate with a higher AOU, as long as everyone aligns on this assumption. The OKRs are now focused on more trackable things like RPU or weekly active users, with net revenue as the ultimate north star.





Suggested next steps

* Maria Chelminska will look into things, run the business cases, and make evidence on the OKR numbers by calculating the launches in the doc that are the most valid and have the biggest expected impact, to understand if the OKR is done this week.

Summary

Nikita Gorshkov updated Eva Martínez Romero on the functioning AI-generated documentation system, which automatically updates and sets the next agenda, granting Eva Martínez Romero access. Eva Martínez Romero informed Nikita Gorshkov about an upcoming meeting with Tisha to discuss role expectations and salary, confirming a 12 to 18-month contract, with Nikita Gorshkov noting 18 months would require Jamba's support due to budget constraints involving Lauran and Yuri, and confirmed a salary range of plus minus 100k for the contract employee role. Eva Martínez Romero also detailed current team assignments and scope expansion, with Simon standardizing across brands, driving strategy for new ventures, and consolidating data, while Eva Martínez Romero serves as the team lead, allowing Alexia to focus on market innovations, and Eva Martínez Romero will share this summary with Nikita Gorshkov to ensure Lauron is informed.

* AI-Generated Documentation and Meeting Access Nikita Gorshkov mentioned that they are building an AI-generated documentation system that is working well, as all of the current documentation was generated automatically from the gathered context. Nikita Gorshkov granted Eva Martínez Romero access to this system, noting that it will update documentation on a meeting-by-meeting basis and set the next agenda. Eva Martínez Romero thanked them for the access (00:00:00).

* Upcoming Meeting with Tisha and Role Expectations Eva Martínez Romero informed Nikita Gorshkov about a meeting with Tisha the next morning at 9:30 AM to collect information on Tisha's expectations, as Tisha confirmed interest in reviewing potential specs for a role. Nikita Gorshkov declined to join due to their night shift schedule, which means they start work around 10 to 10:30 AM (00:01:15). Eva Martínez Romero sought alignment on the contract length for the role, confirming the discussion around 12 to 18 months, with Nikita Gorshkov clarifying that 12 months is fine but 18 months would require support from Jamba due to next year's budgets, which affect Lauran and Yuri's ability to commit (00:02:18).

* Budget and Contract Details for Tisha's Role Eva Martínez Romero planned to mention the 12-month contract option to Tisha and collect their salary expectations. Nikita Gorshkov stated that a salary range of plus minus 100k is acceptable, which corresponds to 100% base pay with no equity component for a contract employee, similar to Yara's arrangement (00:03:20). They confirmed that taxes and related calculations would be similar to normal contracts and that the start date is ideally as early as possible but realistically not before January. The headcount for this role will be assigned directly to Eva Martínez Romero's team (00:04:38).

* Team Assignments and Simon's Role Expansion Eva Martínez Romero explained that the meeting with Tisha will focus on the role and Tisha's motivations, as they are already familiar with the context (00:05:49). Eva Martínez Romero then outlined the current plan for team assignments, stating that Simon, as a staff analyst, should be able to standardize things across brands, drive the long-term strategy for new ventures, and consolidate data from different domains, including Shopify and non-HelloFresh products. Simon will be the new ventures contact, while Eva Martínez Romero will serve as the team lead, which allows Alexia to step into shopp

00:08:12

 

Nikita Gorshkov: Yep.

Eva Martínez Romero: maybe probably Alexa will be very very keen on driving. We have the current iteration of the content for the content creators uh where I think Simon can be a good uh a good component.

Nikita Gorshkov: Huh?

Eva Martínez Romero: He has been on boarding in very different ecosystems and it's good to have uh somebody to drive the long-term strategy on how we're going to be consolidating this data from different domains because we are working on Shopify and and this data that it's not coming from the HelloFresh products directly. So that's more or less my thought in terms of how are we coordinating at the moment the the assignments but yeah he has been a little bit protected during the on boarding pro uh period so that he could

Nikita Gorshkov: Okay. Understood. Okay. Okay. Cool.

Eva Martínez Romero: on board and and ramp up with the with focusing on on VMS but I want him to span his scope already from the start of the year and in in in fact is starting already because he's taking over the perfect order of the rate for me already.

Nikita Gorshkov: Mhm. Oh, nice.

Eva Martínez Romero: So we are we are starting to board him on the new ventures as well.

Nikita Gorshkov: Perfect. Cool. I'll then uh or feel free to also reach out to Lauron if you want because then he he'd have a bit more um confidence that things are moving in the in the right direction. Um because that that's what he's been pummeling me and Addy about for some time and we're trying to like it's moving.

Eva Martínez Romero: Yeah, perfect. But I'll I'll write I'll write a summary of what I just shared with you in Slack because you're being also a Matt so that I can I can give that written form.

Nikita Gorshkov: Cool. Oh yeah, perfect.

Eva Martínez Romero: Uh I don't have time. It's a backto-back meetings, but I'll I'll make sure I capture that also in that thread.

Nikita Gorshkov: Nice. I hope the system will capture it, but yeah, we'll see.

1. Context/Why

This 1:1 provides an opportunity to follow up on key strategic initiatives and ongoing projects discussed in our previous meeting. We aim to review progress, address any emerging challenges, and align on next steps for critical areas such as the Tishi headcount conversion, Simon's involvement in development, and the VMS error metric report.





________________





2. Participant Notes

* Eva Martínez Romero: Leading strategic initiatives related to team bandwidth, development prioritization, and metric reporting to support business needs.

* Nikita Gorshkov: Providing strategic oversight, exploring funding avenues, and reviewing key reports to enable broader team support.





________________





3. Last Meeting Recap (December 4, 2025)

Our last 1:1 focused on two main strategic points:





* Tishi Headcount Conversion: Eva proposed a business case to convert Tishi's existing freelancer headcount to a permanent or temporary contract to address bandwidth needs for TPT and Good shop. Nikita supported this, suggesting funding could come from Good shop and TPT, and noted a PA might be a more cost-effective solution than a contractor.

   * Key Action: Nikita planned to discuss this with Yuri and Lauron to initiate the conversation, considering a temporary contract as a viable interim solution.

* Involving Simon in Road Mapping & Development: Eva outlined plans to involve Simon more closely in road mapping and development, including handing over the development of the perfect order rate. This was driven by recurrent prioritization issues in the shopping experience's lithium release impacting local markets.

   * Key Action: Eva also suggested, and both agreed, that Simon should create an extended report on the VMS error metric (to include Good shop and TPT data) for Nikita to review, aiming to bolster support for Alexia.





________________





4. Agenda Suggestions

1. Follow-up on Tishi Headcount Conversion: Update on discussions with Yuri and Lauron, and next steps.

2. Simon's Involvement: Progress on integrating Simon into road mapping and the handover of perfect order rate development.

3. VMS Error Metric Report: Review of Simon's extended report, initial findings, and next steps for leveraging it.

4. Strategic Alignment: Discuss any new priorities or emergent blockers related to current initiatives.

5. Open Discussion / AOB.





________________





5. Key Questions

* What was the outcome of your discussion with Yuri and Lauron regarding the Tishi headcount conversion? Are there any updates on potential funding from Good shop and TPT?

* What is the current status of Simon's involvement in road mapping, and has the handover of the perfect order rate development begun?

* Has Simon's extended report on the VMS error metric been completed or are there any initial insights? How can we best utilize this report to support Alexia?

* Are there any new critical issues or developments stemming from the shopping experience's lithium release that require attention?

* Are there any other topics or challenges you'd like to discuss that could impact our current strategic objectives?

Enabling One-Time-Purchase (OTP) Capabilities for HF Groups Customers

	Summary: One-time-purchases enable HelloFresh to address customer needs for order flexibility, accessibility and concerns around subscription commitment, while enabling new ways to engage with existing, new and past customers across a variety of different use cases. This PRD aims to consolidate all known use cases for OTP in 2025 for HFG to define a path forward towards implementation.

[HOW TO READ] This document is structured based on three big parts:

1. Summary & High-Level Overview Tab: These tabs serve as the central strategic hub. It outlines context and brief customer flows for each major use case (e.g., Good Chop, Seasonal Boxes) to give a quick understanding of the customer journey. It also synthesizes the Key Functionalities that need to be built across all these different use cases.

2. Individual Use Case Tabs (e.g., "Experience - Good Chop", "Experience - Seasonal Boxes"): Each of these dedicated tabs dives deep into a specific product or initiative. They break down the requirements by Milestones (e.g., MVP - Milestone 1), providing a clear roadmap from a use case perspective. The requirements are listed with User Stories and Acceptance Criteria format.

3. Dependency Tab: These tabs are used to identify and detail any specific work or information required from dependent Tribes and alliances.

1. Summary View of the Solution Proposed

This initiative aims to deliver a One-Time-Purchase (OTP) capability experience across HelloFresh Group brands. As of June 2025, across HelloFresh, several use cases had been identified—such as event-themed seasonal boxes, curated selections of specialized items (e.g., premium meat and seafood from Good Chop), items from a broader marketplace of third-party CPG brands, or ready-to-eat meals from sister brands like Factor—as standalone purchases, without the necessity of an active weekly meal kit subscription for that particular transaction (though OTP may also complement existing subscriptions).

The solution involves creating a seamless OTP user flow within each participating brand's digital platform. This includes clear product discovery for OTP-eligible items, transparent pricing and benefits, distinct OTP cart[a] and checkout processes, appropriate order management for both new and existing customers (subscribed, paused, or cancelled), and downstream capabilities such as delivery management and data.

This foundational OTP capability will initially be piloted and rolled out for:

1. 2025 Initiative Rollouts: 

   1. Seasonal Boxes across HelloFresh (similar to the ANZ model but integrated).

   2. Good Chop offerings for both prospects and actives.

   3. Factor Form item based OTP purchase

2. 2026 Potential Targets:

   1. A 2-Way Marketplace on a selected HelloFresh brand (e.g., Green Chef US pilot) (potential PoC in Q4 2025) 

   2. Cross-selling of Factor meals (as OTP) (iteration on the “Opt-in” Market Integration Model)

   3. Further discovery m

create add-on menus, call another menu, etc. if we don't have to.

[by]What about the other way around? Are we expecting an ability to use existing benefits (through loyalty program) for the seasonal boxes?

[bz]What does it actually mean? Can you drop an example?

[ca]wondering the same - @nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com what did you have in mind?

[cb]@mabu@hellofresh.com lmk if this is clearer now @nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com

[cc]What's "GST charge"?

[cd]Goods and Service Fee - NZ is set at 15% and is normally baked into products sold and AU is 10% but there are different rules to consider in order to remain compliant.

[ce]Assuming this would be a separate payment for customers who may also be ordering a regular subscription box? Similarly to how we charge HFM currently?

[cf]Payment details are never stored in the HF system, hence, it is not possible to prefill payment details. What we can try doing is "use existing payment" which would be a reference to a payment token.

[cg]What do we mean by this?

In H2 2025, our product strategy was designed to address unrecovered Conversion Rates (CR) and declining Active Order Rates (AOR). For CR, we successfully launched the Reactivation page revamp and are on progress to launch the One Time Purchase experiment. On the AOR side, we drove Free Add-on take rates to over 90% consistently by closing gaps in the selection and persistence experience, and launched Charge at Checkout.

1. Reactivation Page Revamp. We launched a new, mobile-first reactivation page that reduces the page length by one third with improvements on information architecture and clearer call to action. Also, customers can now choose their free add-ons directly on the reactivation page, instead of after reactivating their accounts. These changes are foundational to run more free for life reactivation campaigns including turkeys on Thanksgiving  (+20% CR YoY). However, some critical features were de-prioritized such as the ability to change cadence and reschedule directly on the reactivation page. 

2. One-Time Purchases (OTP). The technical solution for OTP pivoted from the initial MVP hack to the proper solution due to a technical blocker from CRM as well as higher confidence in the new endpoint following HF rollouts. While this solution saves time in the long-term, the launch week is delayed (likely W2’2026 - TBC) due to additional time for another technical investigation and (unplanned) capacity constraints.

3. Closing Free Add-on Take Rate. By October we finally reached +90% free add-on take rate for both new and active users consistently. Persisting free add-ons (+40% active TR), developing the multi-add-on pop-up on funnel and reactivation (+5% TR), and migrating bundle offers to Wallet (4.2k customers). While it’s great that we finally closed down the Wallet take rate gap, a significant portion of Q3 engineering capacity was allocated, which was not originally accounted for in the H2 roadmap.

4. Charge at Checkout. By charging customers at checkout instead of at cut-off, we aim to improve empty conversions and acceptance rates, thereby positively impacting overall delivered orders.





Learnings: 

* Better resource planning for adhoc and technical initiatives needed: We only executed on 2 out of 5 key strategies referenced in the previous strategy document with projects such as the Pricing Value Experiment getting pushed to next year. When planning for H2 2025, we did not initially account for initiatives such as Subscribable free add ons, as well as more tactical initiatives like 2-week cadence or legal compliance initiatives in the (cancellation) funnel. Engineering capacity was also impacted around September-October due to personnel changes, including one transfer to TPT and two individuals taking parental leave. We also need to proactively account for resourcing technical initiatives such as endpoint deprecations and migrations.

* More space needed for iterations: there are initiatives such as Seamless and Search with clear next iterations, however instead of building these we focused on building new initiatives. This delays implementing these learnings and therefore realization of business value. Doing these next iterations with too much time in between can also lengthen development as the team has to re-learn the technical context for the next itera

g HLE: express delivery, OTP for Actives

[r]i think this should be dependent on OTP leads results

[s]how come? I don't think the learnings from Leads test will necessarily transfer





It could work better because cancelled customers might have already experienced first-hand that subscription does not work 





We could even think about targeting specifically customers that have churned due to delivery frequency reasons

[t]-> hesitation more from a BC perspective + no ability to discount





-> refer to HF test learnings

[u]~10% cancel for "lifestyle" reason (="sub doens't work for me")

[aa]potentially already planned for CDP v2 to fix data lag

[ab]it would be interesting to sequence the rebranding with value driven initiatives, such as richer PDPs. so we can collaborate with mktg on how to tackle the changes' communications

[ac]in the end if we want to do this well and continue highlighting new products, new deals, we eventually need to find a way to showcase surcharge cuts pre-checkout





I'm wondering if we should re-test surcharge pre-checkout but as its own section/maybe even bringing the 2-step flow pre-checkout 





because if we find a good way to frame surcharge cuts and Deals pre-checkout, then we will have more merchandising we can do pre-checkout as well





EOS+transparent pricing also a criteria

[ad]already big reasons to buy for prospects - we could target this to actives

Problem Statement

Social media has become a primary hub for culinary inspiration, where people turn to influencers to discover new recipes. While Followers struggle to find the necessary ingredients and an easy way to re-cook them, Influencers look for new revenue streams to be more independent from the heavily controlled platforms and find new ways to expand their reach and engage with their audiences authentically and organically via food.





Opportunity:

Hellofresh sees a huge opportunity to serve both: by transforming influencers' inspiration (recipe) into a shoppable, cookable meal kit for the consumers. 

By bridging the gap as the Expert in operation, warehouses and logistics, we provide customers a way to enjoy these recipes easily and the influencer to serve their followers and create a new revenue stream. The social commerce market is growing rapidly and can represent a huge opportunity for us to attract new customers.





Why now:

We see the urgency to act now, because influencers are already trying to solve this problem with links to ingredient orders  via Instacart or Pinterest partners with Instacart to enable 1-click grocery list generation from saved pins. But today, shoppable content on social media within the food category is often limited to individual food items as opposed to a holistic offering where the ingredients for entire recipes and direct delivery can be purchased. 





The Core Ask 

WBD: Influencer Marketplace

Explore desired and viable vision for a curated recipe creator marketplace (1. influencer, 2. Aggregators) with the option of an  instant purchase as a meal kit ‘fulfilled by HelloFresh’.





Long-term Vision (Later) 

Transform HelloFresh into the “Spotify for food”  a platform where any creator can share a recipe that HelloFresh fulfills.

Prototype Test

Prototype for evaluating the concept













[a]On this slide I think there is a lot of misspelled AI words on the vetting examples and the text is very small. If it is possible, making the text readable and correct might be necessary. I could see participants being thrown off by the misspellings and not being able to read the info to learn about the step. @annette.mvde@hellofresh.com

_Assigned to annette.mvde@hellofresh.com_

[b]Yes, agree, I need to export higher resolution picture or re-create it myself

[c]@katheryn.eckles@hellofresh.com Do we need this?

[d]I don't think it adds too much, I think we could remove it.

[e]👍

[f]@katheryn.eckles@hellofresh.com would you rather do a feature cart sorting?

[g]I don't think we would have time to do actual card sorting in this session. I would say it would be okay to just ask them to rank the features on what they see as 'essential' to 'nice to have'

[h]would we need to create a hellofresh shop with all influencer recipes to shop and the influencer itself advertise it?

New Ventures Operational Overhead calculation



"How it works

This sheet provides the percentage of operational overhead (i.e. KTLO work per month). Each team has a dedicated tab. For this to work, you need to
* add the label KTLO to all Jira tickets that you consider KTLO work
* Make sure all tickets that move into the “resolved” state have assigned story points. Add the actual story point in hindsight for accurate operational overhead calculation
A cron job runs every night and updates this sheet. It used the resolved date to include a ticket in the calculation for a specific month.

### DOC: 2026 People Domain Objectives
ID: 1wCEpKV3LSRuUAO_qjkPUuO2mBIPp5_4chdbDjqupRZM
Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wCEpKV3LSRuUAO_qjkPUuO2mBIPp5_4chdbDjqupRZM/edit?usp=drivesdk
----------------------------------------

﻿Domain Objectives

* People Domain 2026





1. Objective: Enable a Reliable, Engaged, and Efficient Front-Line Workforce

Measure of success: Early Attrition Rate (Output Metric) throughout the year we will bring visibility to the adequate input metrics

Objective Owner: Shawn Spanier Philipp BörnerJames Gorman 

Investment Type: Existing 

HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  1. Quality, Packaging and Ingredient SKU innovation 2. XL Menu Expansion5. Efficiency Program/Cost to Serve 

Description: Our objective is to ensure our front-line associates are proud to be part of the HelloFresh team by building an engaged, safe, and reliable workforce. We will enhance the employee experience through consistent HR processes, clear manager expectations, and a focus on safety and respect, all of which will directly improve labor efficiency and cost.

1. Scalable people foundation: In line with operations project Highlander we will seek to establish standards related to Field People including defining operational jobs and career progression, staffing footprint based on building type and size, shift schedules, labor planning approach, employee relations and policy frameworks, etc. to facilitate consistent operating models that scale along with our single operational technology stack. We will standardize only where there is a clear benefit in 1) deploying standard processes and tools for labor planning or 2) solving employee pain points that result in expected enhancement in early retention. 

2. Global Workforce Health Mechanism: We will establish and build on mechanisms to review operational healthiness with a consistent focus on the right workforce mix, attrition, absenteeism, and engagement. We will partner with operations to harmonize  weekly reviews and ensure deliberate action is taken to address pain points with the goal of identifying and quickly solving employee and staffing issues with a repeatable feedback loop. 

3. Global Workday Implementation: We will implement FreshField globally to have 100% of workers in our system. This will facilitate improved visibility into our labor availability, enhanced reconciliation for invoicing of contingent labor, and facilitate better communication with employees through engagement feedback loop touchpoints.

















































2. Objective: Enable a high performance culture and increase our talent density

Measure of success: Regrettable Attrition % of HiPo/Critical roles, Achievement of top 3 talent priorities

Objective Owner: Shawna Fehrman-LeeYasar AhmadSyed Ali Abbas

Investment Type: Existing    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  All 

Description: This objective is about executing on our existing processes with a renewed and clear focus on business impact. Our HRBPs will work with leaders to have clear talent priorities that enable our top 5 strategies. They will partner with our COEs so that our talent processes and rituals are used as tools to bring those objectives to life.  We will achieve this by setting clear expectations, modeling the right behaviors, and providing data to enable accountability. 





1. Defining & Reporting on Business Talent Objectives: HRBPs will spend the rest of 2026 defining concrete talent objectives and the GLT will implement a quarterly reporting mechanism to show progress versus those initiatives. Example initiatives include: Design the target footprint for the MD organization and transition to that footprint by EOY. Implement a multi-location talent strategy to increase the number of Engineers as a percentage of the total tech team populat

 in technology investment. We also experience meaningful spikes in unplanned work that may require us to re-prioritize. Additionally, as an organization we are yet to mature in terms of processes, leadership capability, and ways of working. This creates both opportunity for growth and significant dependency on HR, as managers often lack the skills to independently handle people issues, engagement, and grievance management. While standardisation (systems, tools, processes) offers potential benefits, the organisation may not yet be ready; building managerial and organisational capability is a necessary foundation. Without this, HR will remain overstretched, providing compensatory support instead of enabling a more self-sufficient & independently capable leaders & business.



      * What objectives would MDs and other key stakeholders be most disappointed to have left out for 2026? 

         1. Addressing low Foodie budgets and salary bands which are driving top performer attrition 

         2. Improving specific items in performance management and related processes (i.e. ease performance curve restrictions, have more business leader discretion on allocation of Foodie raises and perf grants, simplify Foodie process further, make it more or less )





         * What are other supporting metrics for each Domain Objective (KPI Tree)













Objective

	Output (Lagging) Metrics / Did we win?

	Input (Leading) Metrics / Will we win?

	1. Reliable, Engaged, Efficient Frontline Workforce

	Early Attrition Rate %

	Absenteeism %, Engagement (frontline survey) score %, Manager NPS (frontline), Onboarding completion %

﻿Domain Objectives

This document summarizes the 2026 Objectives for the domain and answers FAQs. Working Group/PoCs: Patrick StalJal TummalaSebastian StarkeBjörn HeckelEvan WeintraubIshita Mehta

________________





Domain Objectives

Our marketing strategy for 2026 fully aligns with The Refresh ambition: to reignite brand relevance for HelloFresh and Factor, build sustainable, profitable (re-)acquisition and retention growth levers, invest in lasting customer relationships and unlock efficiency. Our primary areas of focus proposed for 2026 are described below by priority. 

TL;DR Priorities

What is in the more extensive write-up below is correct and captures the more detailed sketches of our plans for 2026. But within that, there are 4 key priorities that we will deliver with higher urgency than any of the other parts. These are as follows:





Domain Objective 1 : Step-change our performance marketing engine’s performance, rebuild our Paid Social muscle, (including dedicated creative production capabilities and fresh global talent), optimize spend and reduce D in (CAC + D)

Objective Owner:  Aifric CampbellJessica Blum

Investment Type: Existing    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  5. Efficiency Program/Cost to Serve 

Measure of success: 

Success will be measured by progress against the following objectives/KPIs:

* Shift to incremental measurement ecosystem

* Automate >80% of bid decisioning on programmatic channels (Search, Display, PS)

* # of Settled Conversions (target tbd in BP)

Paid Social (Rebuild, and focus on accelerating underleveraged formats: whitelisting, video, reach, tiktok, etc.)

* % of Paid spend on Paid social

* Paid Social # of Settled Conversions (target tbd in BP)

* Brand mentions on social (as halo from paid activities)

Discount spend reduction:

* > 50% of discount spend in targeted / personalized discounts

* Rapid, low-cost discount (elasticity) testing methods in use across all markets

* Reduction of discount per settled conversion by XX EUR p.scvr



Domain Objective 2 : Commit at least 1/3 of global marketing spend to Brand (Demand Generating) channels, and 50% of that Brand spend to ‘innovative’ brand activation tactics

Objective Owner:  Anna Koklanakis

Investment Type: Existing    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  3. Brand Reignition 

Measure of success: 

Success will be measured by progress against the following objectives/KPIs:

   * % of spend in Demand Generating channels (target = 33%, from a 2025 total of 21% globally)

   * 4 Global A+ celebrity partnerships activated (and grow share of total marketing spend on local influencer content)

   * 4 Global sponsorship deals activated

   * 4 Global 3rd party partners for surprising brand integrations (i.e. AirBNB product boxes, Ikea kitchen partnership, special edition Crocs, Spotify playlists executed

   * >4 cookware partnerships in NA (e.g. Zwilling, Misen, Caraway, Nutribullet, NINJA and 2 partnerships for Factor (e.g. Oura, lululemon, Hoku, etc)) executed

Domain Objective 3 : Re-set the velocity with which we are accelerating our Organic growth ecosystem

Objective Owner:  Aifric Campbell Jal Tummala

Investment Type: Existing    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  5. Efficiency Program/Cost to Serve 

Measure of success: 

Success will be measured by progress against the following objectives/KPIs:

   * Remove voucher attribution anchor (allow audiences to convert full-price)

   * Accelerate SEO and GEO progress (impressions, % settled CVRs)

   * Build a pro-active community engagement muscle (digital, in-app w/ project 5M, physical)

 shaping culture, driving creativity, and building lasting brand relevance. We will achieve this by doing the following differently :

1. Automate the Marketing Backbone (also covered in DO 4) : 

   * Hardwire automation across campaign management, reporting, and diagnostics to collapse cycle times from wks to hrs. 

   * Automate intelligence to reallocate spend in real time across channels, audiences, and creative, while 

   * Personalize engines  that dynamically adapt offers and journeys at scale

   * Stronger foundational forecasting models and automate >50% of the current marketing budget process - freeing up hundreds of hours of capacity for more value-add tasks

2. Redesign the Marketing Operating Model

   * Shift from manual execution to automation-led orchestration, with a central control tower overseeing guardrails and agile pods combining media, data, and creative in continuous test-and-learn cycles

   * Daily and Weekly tracking meetings will be fed by AI and ML engines, and will be decision meetings rather than reporting mechanisms (recommendations being automated)

   * Playbook documentation will be standardized, archived in a crawlable manner for our AI enabled Marketing skill base

   * Best practices will be shared more pro-actively, and our tools will help us identify where learnings from one market could lift another in the portfolio

   * Shift human focus from repetitive tasks to brand building, provocative storytelling, and cultural engagement

3. Industrialize Creative Production (also covered in DOs 1 and 2)

   * Transform creative into a high-velocity system, where automation and AI accelerate asset generation, adaptation, and testing across formats.

   * Support storyboarding, copy design, and creative variation through GenAI, while strict guardrails ensure efficiency enhances, rather than dilutes, brand integrity and cultural resonance

4. Rewire Talent & Capabilities

   * Provide learning opportunity to receive basic AI training all marketing talent 

   * Map Talent on AI proficiency model per function, and AI proficiency will be a core aspect of JDs, competency maps, performance reviews and career progression

   * Reshape team to thrive in an automation-first world by adding new muscles : automation specialists, creative technologists and data engineers while ensuring existing talent becomes fluent in AI-enabled tools

Notes

* OTP Launch → decision: to have FF turn on in W02, but everything should be ready by EOY





Options

	Pros

	Cons

	Decision

	Launch W50

	More time before AD/ND

Time to iterate if issues

Time to rollout gradually





	Won’t make it! 

Less time for e2e testing

	No Go

	Launch W51 (To 90% of users)

	Original plan

On-track from dev pov

Captures business value earlier (~$15k in revenue)





	Super risky as most devs are out (Jordon, Jan, Edwin, Emily, Daniel, Travis)

Super close to EOY

Might break something on Factor

Not enough time for gradual rollout

On-calls: Emily Stanek (W50), Paul Andrews (W51/52)

	Maybe

	Launch W51 

(To only 10%)

	Mitigates the risk

Collects some feedback before the peak

	Still risky (Not enough devs to support)

Limited business impact





	No Go

	Launch W02

(To 90% of users)

	Less risky (Devs available for support)

Still before the actual peak

Won’t break anything on Factor/FF

	Delayed launch

Opportunity cost





	Go! 

	  W46 2024 - W04 2025 → The market is pretty soft over the last few weeks of the year

ckable only — no code).





Recruit 10–15 representative users (existing customers or target personas).





Ask them to choose between:





Current “build-your-own” flow





The new “plan-based” flow





Ask follow-ups:





Which feels more tailored to you?





Which would you trust more?





How likely are you to purchase?





✅ Advantages: Fast qualitative signal; surfaces objections early.

💡 Tip: Use Figma Analytics or Maze metrics (time on screen, clicks) for light quant data.





Option 3: “Fake Door” Test in Live Site





Goal: Measure real interest from actual users without building full functionality.





On your live PLP or homepage, add a new section or banner:





“Introducing our new lifestyle plans — Performance, Focus, and Foundation.”

CTA: “Explore Plans.”





When users click, send them to a “Coming Soon” page or a short survey:





“We’re launching soon — tell us which plan interests you most.”





Measure clicks, plan preference, and sign-ups for early access.





✅ Advantages: True behavioral data from live traffic.

💡 Tip: Works well if your current site already gets meaningful volume.





Option 4: Email or CRM Campaign Test





Goal: Validate resonance of messaging and pricing.





Segment your customer base (athletes, busy professionals, general wellness).





Send A/B email variants — one promoting current product set, one promoting “plans.”





Measure CTR, click-to-checkout, or pre-order intent.





✅ Advantages: Zero dev time, quick pulse check on messaging effectiveness.





📊 How to Evaluate Results

Metric        Signal        Success Criteria

CTR / engagement        Do users click into plan-based offers more than product-based ones?        +15–20% vs. baseline

Intent (survey or fake door)        Are users more likely to say they’d subscribe?        Majority (>60%) positive

AOV (simulated)        When choosing a plan, is average intended spend higher?        +10–15% lift

Qualitative sentiment        Do users say the plan feels easier, more relevant, or trustworthy?        Positive pattern emerges





If 2–3 of these indicators trend positively, that’s a green light to justify design + dev investment for a live experiment.





🚀 Recommended Next Step (Low-Effort, High-Insight)





Build a simple Figma prototype with your three plans + “Choose Plan” CTA, and test it via qualitative plan. (Option 2)

New T&C Disclaimers for Activation / Reactivation

Author: Tommaso Cremonini

Updated Apr 24, 2025





TL:DR[a]

The new disclaimer copy, mandatory consent checkbox, and revised disclosure order have led to a -10.9% drop in gross activations, equivalent to €72.8M loss in annual CVA. As expected, there was a statistically significant decrease in the share of cancelling customers (-17.1%) but we will need a few more days to see how much this will improve net activations compared to the gross activation drop. These findings highlight the need for urgent adjustments to mitigate these adverse effects before the FTC ruling's effective date (14-May).





Summary

Experimentation dates

	Variant

	Screen

	Disclaimer

	n/a

	Live now (control)

	  



	By clicking "Place order & select meals", I agree to the Terms and Conditions, the Privacy Policy, and the weekly auto-renewal price of $64.93 after my discount period. I can cancel my plan anytime in my account at least 5 days prior to my next delivery.

	Button Behavior

	Disclaimer

	I agree to the Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy. I also agree that my plan will auto-renew at $29.99/week once my discount ends. I can cancel anytime in my account at least 5 days before my next delivery.

	Hypotheses

	It refines the consent process by integrating concise auto-renewal details directly into the disclaimer text and moving away from Experiment #2's more forceful disclaimer highlighting. This iteration reorders the disclaimer, placing the auto-renewal terms after the acceptance of the general T&C and PP, a pattern observed in other US subscription models like Marley Spoon or Home Chef, potentially reducing initial hesitation.

	Button Behavior

	Subscription button is disabled if: 

- payment method is not inserted and validated

- disclaimer checkbox is not selected 





If the checkbox is not marked and the subscription button is clicked, an error message is highlighted above the subscription button. 





Moved the Satisfaction guarantee banner between the payment container and the disclaimer

	Hypotheses

	Var 1: building on exp#1, this variation replaces the alarming static red alert message with a dynamic error message that appears only when the user attempts to proceed without checking the box. The hypothesis here is that by removing the upfront visual friction of the red alert, we can reduce user anxiety and encourage more users to complete the checkout process, while still ensuring compliance through the clear error feedback.









Var 2: highlighting the entire disclaimer when the user hasn't checked the box is a very direct way to ensure the user acknowledges the terms. However, this method carries the risk of drawing excessive atte

[n]What about accessibility concerns here btw? Screen readers will definitely not play nice with this. Sorry just realized as I was updating the mobile mocks. @tommaso.cremonini@hellofresh.com @sherief.helaifi-chadha@hellofresh.com

[o]That's a separate legal risk, and we have already settled several accessibility demand letters/class actions, so this risk needs to be considered, regardless of relatively how few sign up on desktop.

[p]Outside counsel: For one-off single purchase followed by separate/compliant AR disclosure consent: if one-off customer decides not to enroll, then only send initial box, and don't subscribe/email customer.

[t]Sorry forgot to respond. Liking this as a variant! I have a version post-checkout, this would be a more (shorter-term) pre-checkout variant.

[u]@thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com let's discuss in the call what options we have. can the CTA remain enabled even without checkbox to make sure people click, and solve this through error message attention?

[v]Not sure what you mean by 'remain enabled' -- customer should NOT be able to advance by clicking it, unless and until customer has checked box. But yes, CTA can remain live/green, as long as a non-box-checking customer who clicks it cannot advance, always gets the error message, and can only advance with click if box has been checked.

[w]@sherief.helaifi-chadha@hellofresh.com @thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com @dalia.eid@hellofresh.com is this copy (as is) mandatory or is there an opportunity to adjust for tone and clarity without losing legal intent or FTC compliance ... for example, something like: "I understand my plan auto-renews at $XX.XX/week after the discount ends. I can cancel anytime in my account, at least 5 days before my next delivery. I agree to the [Terms and Conditions] and [Privacy Policy]."

[x]No, not express and affirmative consent required by FTC rule.

 brief analysis here?

_Assigned to thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com_

[aw]Variation 5: FBFL here would violate the draft Rule, which prohibits including any information that “interferes with, detracts from, contradicts, or otherwise undermines the consumer's ability to provide express informed consent.”

[ax]@thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com Same for this

_Assigned to thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com_

[ay]@thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com @dalia.eid@hellofresh.com what can we do here in terms of value props

_Assigned to thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com_

[az]Q in to outside counsel

[ba]Feedback from outside counsel: Defensible position as long as value prop relates to the subscription (element or term of subscription) (but not only a marketing value prop, for example, could not say "save 30%).

[bb]Could alternatively state "cancel anytime" as a value prop

[bc]Thank you! What about something like "we will remind you via email before auto-renewal"?

[bd]Yes, that is an autorenew element/term

[be]@thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com @dalia.eid@hellofresh.com

[bf]Sticky CTA variation

[bg]defensible, considered compliant by outside counsel

[bh]@dalia.eid@hellofresh.com @thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com can we say "slide to agree & select meals"

_Assigned to dalia.eid@hellofresh.com_

[bi]considered defensible/compliant by outside counsel

[bj](1) Change "Do you Agree with our Terms &Conditions" to "How our Subscription Work"  and also (2) change "by clicking  checkout" to "by clicking "place order & select meals".

[bk]More variations added here @thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com @dalia.eid@hellofresh.com

[bl]considered compliant/defensible by outside counsel

[bm]as mentioned above: can we find markets where such a rule is already in effect and we can find inspiration

[bn]@naseem.hasan@hellofresh.com didn't they also have a slider?

[bo]They use the slide button for a one-time purchase when you hit "Buy Now" on an item.

[bp]Interesting, so exactly the opposite of the new rule requirement 🤔

Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Beatrice Dimarucut set up a meeting with Maria Chelminska, Prateek Jajoo, someone in Bread Sheeran (Canada - Toronto HQ, 2), someone in Bread Sheeran (Canada - Toronto HQ, 2), Nikita Gorshkov, and Alison Ryan to review and align on next year's plans across various teams. Maria Chelminska and Prateek Jajoo outlined TBT 2026's strategy, which includes a growth stream focused on expanding the SKU portfolio, revamping the signup page as a quick win, and a strategic launch of a "pantry fresh" product, alongside a retention stream focused on fully digital feeding guides, dashboard improvements, tailored cancellation deflection, and a plan recommendation engine. Someone in Bread Sheeran (Canada - Toronto HQ, 2) and someone in Bread Sheeran (Canada - Toronto HQ, 2) detailed Factor's Q1 roadmap, constrained by the Shopify experiment outcome and new product development complexities, focusing on OTP launch iterations, new product development (mealshake and creatine) despite SKU flexibility issues, and integrating with the Factor app, while Beatrice Dimarucut presented Good Chop's H1 roadmap, prioritizing the OTP launch, a price value experiment to improve conversion/retention, and foundational work to clean up legacy code in the funnel. The participants also discussed integrating third-party tools like Beam for charity donations, Yachtpool for product ratings, and Incom for HelloFresh gift card partnerships.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Schedule and Meeting Logistics Beatrice Dimarucut set up the meeting to review and align on plans for the next year, aiming to identify overlaps and opportunities to combine courses for development and discovery. Maria Chelminska mentioned that their team's plan is fairly complete for the year, though changes are likely, with Q1 being closer to concrete (00:01:14). The discussion also briefly touched upon workplace conditions, as Maria Chelminska and Prateek Jajoo were meeting in a different building because the heating was broken in the main HelloFresh building in Berlin, which had been a long-term issue (00:00:00).

* TBT 2026 Strategy and Streams Maria Chelminska confirmed that for 2026, the team will operate in two streams: a growth stream and a retention stream. These streams might have separate backlogs, and Maria Chelminska and Prateek Jajoo may focus more on one stream each (00:01:14). The growth stream will follow a setup with a main priority—a larger, strategically important initiative—and quick wins, which are smaller, sprint releases intended to motivate the team and maintain pace (00:02:39).

* Growth Stream Initiatives (Q1) The growth stream will start the year by expanding the SKU portfolio, adding new calorie options for very small and very big dogs. A key initiative is the signup page revamp. Maria Chelminska stated that the current signup page, which uses a shared layout, has not been updated since its launch, and the goal is to improve it as a quick win to increase the intent to proceed by removing messages about add-ons that currently appear to be an upsell (00:02:39).

* Strategic Priority: Pantry Fresh Product Launch A high-priority strategic project is expanding the product offering with a new product type called pantry fresh, which is a fresh product that does not require refrigeration. To prepare for this, the team is redesigning the existing p

set up uh the integration. I'll keep you folks posted. is fairly straightforward in terms of how it's redeemed. And then we use cash credits that drop onto the HelloFresh accounts uh that the user can redeem in their next box. That's pretty much the the system there. So, if if somebody uh does pick this up, um I I think in at some point once it's live, uh I can see how Yuri and Lauron will get to this topic.

Nikita Gorshkov: We can probably just reuse the whole system wholesale.

Maria Chelminska: But a credit for sorry a gift card for HelloFresh can be also used for only used for HelloFresh.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yes.

Alison Ryan: Those

Nikita Gorshkov: But uh just imagine like you probably saw these same as the Xbox cards, the Amazon cards that you see in stores.

Beatrice Dimarucut: physical.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Mhm.

Nikita Gorshkov: Physical have a fresh group.

Maria Chelminska: Yeah, I was maybe just thinking that it's going to be like a mult multibrand card and we can also benefit from

Beatrice Dimarucut: Nice.

Alison Ryan: are the dreams. Maria in

Nikita Gorshkov: All right, folks.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Nice.

Nikita Gorshkov: Thank you so much for organizing this.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah, I think at least we know more or less what everyone's doing. Hopefully it was useful. Um, yeah. Nice. And Nikita, do you have five minutes to say maybe Allison?

Nikita Gorshkov: Sure.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Okay, cool.

Nikita Gorshkov: Right.

Beatrice Dimarucut: All right. Thank you. Bye. Um, so we were gonna on Thursday like I was planning on sharing with like the the squad like the road map for next year and obviously like also would be good for them to get contacts on Shopify, but

Nikita Gorshkov: H I doubt it

Beatrice Dimarucut: I don't know how to like frame this without freaking people out that it might be a possibility that the web experience gets replaced.

Nikita Gorshkov: honestly that it will be that big of a risk uh right now. I think the way we can frame this and the way we should be framing it is for what it is. It's a way for us to much more rapidly experiment with the offer that we can provide to various customers and it's more

﻿Final YP





💡 Meeting Notes [To be filled after the Review Meeting by the YP Document Owner and sent out via email to attendees. This section does not impact the maximum number of pages]

Review Meeting Date: Oct 16, 2025

Attendees: Ed Boyes Assaf Ronen Dominik Richter Holger Hammel,Cho HwangAnnie MeininghausDina MehrezThomas GrieselFabien SimonMarlene RosnerBrian LeungAdriana VillarEvan WeintraubJama Musse





Key Takeaways, Decisions, and Next Steps:

1. Clarify how menu expansion plans, personalization roll outs  and app features come together: 

   * Elysium (new store and homepage in the app) roll out is fast followed by new app feature which benefits users  irrespective of menu ranking roll out (most notably merchandising widgets for marketing,  recommendation widgets,bringing search to apps, populating “most popular, “trending” widgets - details)

   * Menu ranking roll out: At the same time there is a roll out plan for menu ranking models which prioritizes P500 readiness in Q4/Q1 as well as Penguin for Factor US. Food Systems is trying to expedite Penguin for INTL if possible, prioritized after p500. Fall back is to launch Penguin Harp personalization to INTL markets expanding in Q1.  Other RTE markets in H2.

2. Share prioritization framework  for Project 5M. The prioritization is heavily influenced by successful companies and features observed (direct or indirect competitors) as well as through an internal workshop. This revealed a consistent and significant behavioral gap: Users enthusiastically save recipes (often from social media) but rarely act on them. This indicates a high desire for inspiration but a significant friction point in execution. This led to the prioritization of the recipe bridge in Q4/Q1. If requested we can  walk through the detailed methodology.

3. Decouple forecasting from personalization models. Food Systems to define technical interfaces enabling independent iteration. Once validated, assess org impact in Q1–Q2.

4. Reconcile marketing RAF plan with tech YP.  We have addressed the  gap between Marketing and Consumer growth targets. Share squad will focus on strengthening the Refer-a-Friend (RAF) program while building new in-product sharing loops to drive organic growth. prioritizing foundational fixes — improving data visibility, customer experience, and operational agility — to make the RAF program self-sufficient and easier to optimize without tech dependencies. 

5. Variable pricing is an urgently requested feature by markets. We added it  to the Market Innovation squad backlog H2. Will define long-term ownership before initiation as we are currently moving pricing ownership to growth MA. 





Changes requested to the Yearly Plan during Draft Reviews. Please update before submission for final YP approval:  

* Should we invest into an AOV-focused squad? Yes we will self fund a new AOV driven squad in Q2 with a dedicated KPI. Focus in Q1  is first to roll out the new personalized core journey including widgets and then layer in more upselling components. 

* Loyalty strategy across markets: We decided to reserve a small team to  maintain and improve the existing  program while implementing  the new vendor based loyalty program to launch first in  the US . See Loyalty Strategy SMT Shareout.

* Double check if all Factor requirements are in the plan: All documents were collected and integrated into the Market Innovation backlog. To be signed off by Ed Boyes

Accessibility-2025 Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Accessibility-2025 Program,,,,,,,,,,Recent action Items,,,,,,

,Welcome! The Accessibility-2025 Program will enable HelloFresh Group to complete HelloTech Objective #4 and comply with the modern level of accessibility for our customers driven by The European Accessibility Act (EAA). The program has two goals:,,,,,,,,,,🔄,"Resolve 90% of the P1 issues identified through Cypress that break 11 WCAG rules and manual audits in WEB.
Deadline: December 31st.",,,,,

,1,"Reduce the number of ""important"" Accessibility issues in HelloFresh, GreenChef, and Factor by 90% in WEB experiences by 28 June 2025, and in Mobile experiences by 31 Dec 2025.",,,,,,,,,🔄,"Resolve 90% of the P0 issues identified through Cypress that break 4 WCAG rules and manual audits in REACT NATIVE.
Deadline: December 31st.",,,,,

,2,Establish accessibility standards to support future HelloTech product development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Current P90 compliance,,,,,,source

,Background,,,,,,,,,,WEB,,,,MOBILE,,

,"The European Accessibility Act (EAA), which mandates that websites and mobile applications comply with WCAG 2.2 Level AA accessibility standards, will come into effect on June 28, 2025. The directive applies to all businesses in the EU, including HelloFresh. Non-compliance can result in penalties such as fines (ranging from 500–500k€) or, in some countries like Ireland, even prison sentences. Companies may also face legal action from disability advocacy groups.",,,,,,,,,,33%,,,,15%,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Remediating the risk of fines requires a company-wide collaboration, which is the background of launching this program. Apart from avoiding fines, improved Accessibility in our interfaces also gives us access to new potential customers (with disposable income) who previously may not have considered our product because they functionally were prevented from doing so. There is no calculated business case for the Group yet, but we plan to dig deeper into the opportunity in H2. The program will be driven by Foundations Alliance and involve all CFAs teams owning Front End TRE in mobile or web.",,,,,,,,,,2025 compliance target,,,,,,source

,,,,,,,,,,,WEB,,,,MOBILE,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Foundations Alliance made all Zest components compliant with EAA standards out of the box, however, this does not guarantee full compliance. To achieve full compliance by June 2025, all CFAs will review their journeys and modify them as needed. 

Foundations Alliance has provided the following inputs to enable CFAs to minimize their efforts:",,,,,,,,,,53%,,,,20%,,

, ☑️,"Improved Zest Design System components for iOS, Android, Web, and React Native platforms to have complete compliance with accessibility guidelines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,Created and maintain solution-oriented Accessibility Guidelines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,"Align, Define and Report upon an Accessibility Compliance Score.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,Automated the identification of code-driven accessibility issues based on the automated end-to-end UI Tests,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,"Provided results of a 3rd-party Accessibility Audit for HelloFresh, GreenChef, and Factor brands across web and mobile platforms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

### EMAIL: W52 UK Holiday Shifts -> Shifts Live but Outcodes retained on no delivery days
ID: 19b050cbb5fae13d
From: "'Paul Gabriel' via HelloFresh Critical" <critical@hellofresh.com>
----------------------------------------

Dear team,



We are currently using this

<https://tableau.hellofresh.io/#/views/DeliveryDayManagement/LiveActivesSubscription?%3Aiid=1>

dashboard to track the impact of our holiday shifts for W52.



On delivery day 24th December, we should not have more than 127 outcodes.

The rest have been moved.



Currently, the dashboard and source is showing us that 1338 codes are

retained on the 24th of December.



We did a random check of multiple postal codes from the 1338 retained codes

and they are part of the holiday shifts that are published and live.



As it stands now, we have no visibility on which codes have been moved and

which have not, except the shift files we prepared.



We are also seeing a similar impact on THU (25th Dec) and FRI (26th Dec).

These 2 days should have 0 actives and no outcodes on their respective

delivery days.



This is a critical issue since we are exceptionally late in sending

customer comms and also no visibility regarding if our holiday shifts are

working as planned.



Best,

Hi Nirav,

We have greenlight from procurement, SoW is now with legal - we should be

Summary



Alison Ryan provided updates on the Shopify project for VMS, noting strong  

collaboration with Laura, Samir, and the Netta team as the launch  

approaches and key Recharge issues are resolved, which will simplify future  

projects like Good Chop; Nikita Gorshkov connected with Samir, who also  

feels they are in the final stages. Alison Ryan and Nikita Gorshkov  

discussed the Good Chop contracts, with Alison Ryan clarifying that the  

Recharge partnership was introduced but the contracts are still undergoing  

legal review, a process Yuri posted that procurement approved to fast  

track. Finally, Alison Ryan asked Nikita Gorshkov about the New York office  

check-in process for an upcoming trip, to which Nikita Gorshkov  

advised "bugging Ashling" for access information.

Alison Ryan will contact Ashling to inquire about US office access,  

including necessary codes and policies, for the New York trip next week.



Nikita Gorshkov will follow up with Yuri and Seb regarding the contract  

signing for Shopify for VMS.

Your Atlassian API token has been found on GitHub



Hi Nikita Gorshkov,



We detected one of your API tokens in a public code repository on GitHub at the following URL: https://github.com/feamando/pmos/blob/35231447c5700be88bf8ac7ba3e37e06df76a116/payload/AI_Guidance/Tools/jira_mcp/config.json We have automatically revoked the token to protect you and your data.



*Why did you revoke the token?* Because the code repository containing your token is public, a malicious actor could discover the token and use it to access your data in Jira or Confluence Cloud. We revoked the token to prevent this from happening.



*How was my API token exposed?* You (or someone you shared your token with) added the API token to a file and published that file to a public code repository on GitHub.



*Do I need to do anything?* No, we have already revoked the token to keep you safe. If you used this token elsewhere, you may need to generate a new token ( https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens ).



*What if I need help?* If you have any questions or need help, our Support Team is ready to assist you. Submit a request ( https://support.atlassian.com/contact/ ) , and we'll get you the help you need.

quick win, and a strategic launch of a "pantry fresh" product, alongside a  

retention stream focused on fully digital feeding guides, dashboard  

improvements, tailored cancellation deflection, and a plan recommendation  

engine. Someone in Bread Sheeran (Canada - Toronto HQ, 2) and someone in

Hi everyone,



As I prepare to close this chapter after 5.5 years, I find myself

reflecting on something simple but often overlooked: a team is not just a

group of people working toward shared goals. A team is a temporary

constellation: individual stars whose paths align for a brief moment in

time, long enough to create something brighter than any of us could alone.

I’ve been fortunate to have spent this part of my journey with all of you,

and I want to take a moment to express my gratitude.



First, a heartfelt thank-you to @Jama Musse <jama.musse@hellofresh.ca>:

Your clarity of thought, sense of direction, and depth as a product leader

have shaped my own practice more than you know. I’m leaving here having

learned a tremendous amount from you, about strategy, about leadership, and

about what it means to build with purpose. And @Annie Meininghaus

<anne@hellofresh.com>, thank you as well, for your empathy to our users,

your steadiness, and the way you make complexity feel navigable.



To @James Villacci <james.villacci@hellofresh.com> who's built an

*unparalleled* world-class UXR practice (with incredible researchers such

as @Andrea Henry <andrea.henry@hellofresh.com>, @Caitlin Carlson

<caitlin.carlson@hellofresh.com>, & @Alice Wang <alice.wang@hellofresh.com>

) & @Daniel O'Connell <doco@hellofresh.com> who is literally a magical

 for

the people who made this journey meaningful. Thank you for everything. I

genuinely wish each of you continued growth, purpose, and good success

ahead.



In my next chapter, I will dedicate myself to building a new branch of

science at the Utorics Institute <https://utorics.com/>, where I'll teach

and conduct cognitive quantum-behaviour research.

### EMAIL: Notes: “Maria:Nikita 1:1” Dec 9, 2025

Summary



Nikita Gorshkov provided updates on PA support, noting Simon's increased  

visibility and contingent interviews with five independent contractors,  

while Maria Chelminska confirmed Tishia would be dedicated to TPT, Good  

Job, and VMS if hired. Maria Chelminska is working on business cases to  

provide evidence for OKR numbers, with Nikita Gorshkov emphasizing CVA  

impact over strict numerical accuracy, and Maria Chelminska expecting to  

understand overall goal achievement by the end of the current week. Maria  

Chelminska raised the long time to significance for experiments, with  

Farane suggesting the use of leading indicators or micro conversions to  

shorten this time, which Maria Chelminska noted would require more PA  

support and could face pushback, but Nikita Gorshkov agreed it makes sense  

for small experiments. Maria Chelminska stressed the need for an analyst to  

translate micro conversion impact to key metrics, but Nikita Gorshkov  

suggested focusing on overall business numbers like net revenue, AOU, and  

weekly active users, making assumptions about correlations between metrics.





Suggested next steps





Maria Chelminska will look into things, run the business cases, and make  

evidence on the OKR numbers by calculating the launches in the doc that are  

the most valid and have the biggest expected impact, to understand if the  

OKR is done this week.

Summary



Nikita Gorshkov updated Eva Martínez Romero on the functioning AI-generated  

documentation system, which automatically updates and sets the next agenda,  

granting Eva Martínez Romero access. Eva Martínez Romero informed Nikita  

Gorshkov about an upcoming meeting with Tisha to discuss role expectations  

and salary, confirming a 12 to 18-month contract, with Nikita Gorshkov  

noting 18 months would require Jamba's support due to budget constraints  

involving Lauran and Yuri, and confirmed a salary range of plus minus 100k  

for the contract employee role. Eva Martínez Romero also detailed current  

team assignments and scope expansion, with Simon standardizing across  

brands, driving strategy for new ventures, and consolidating data, while  

Eva Martínez Romero serves as the team lead, allowing Alexia to focus on  

market innovations, and Eva Martínez Romero will share this summary with  

Nikita Gorshkov to ensure Lauron is informed.





Suggested next steps





Nikita Gorshkov will talk with Jamba today to figure out if the group can  

go with the 18 months contract length.



Eva Martínez Romero will write a summary in Slack of the new ventures  

coordination that was shared.



Eva Martínez Romero will take the Tisha meeting.
