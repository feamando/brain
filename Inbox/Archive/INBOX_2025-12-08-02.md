💡 Meeting Notes [To be filled after the Review Meeting by the YP Document Owner and sent out via email to attendees. This section does not impact the maximum number of pages]

Review Meeting Date: Oct 16, 2025

Attendees: Jama MusseCho HwangAnnie MeininghausCho HwangHolger HammelDominik RichterEd BoyesAssaf RonenLaurent GuillemainSeb TronFabien SimonAdriana VillarBrian Leung





Key Takeaways, Decisions, and Next Steps:

1. Alignment needed with Adam Park on plan for Factor Programs, as it fell below the line for Q4 and Q1. Does this need to be reprioritized? Done, we have agreed to keep momentum on physical product as well as planning ahead of Q2 development relaunch 

2. Factor Tech prioritization list created by Adam Park needs to be reviewed against the backlog of the MD squad. Done, we have reviewed the incremental asks, and have pulled them into Ed squad prioritization, and flagged items already in YP’s 

3. Lack of analytics resourcing was highlighted as risk for New Ventures, Annie and Jama to take away and come back with Analytics resourcing plans for New Ventures We have added 1 incremental PA resource to the New Ventures domain space, and will be looking to move additional temporary capacity to reduce the outstanding backlog 

4. Factor Form should better connect their products to customers  goals to create a “personalized performance stack”. Jama to connect with Adam Park on this plan We have added this for exploration in Q3 plan 

5. An aligned strategy should be created on how Loyalty should work for the New Ventures, and should this connect to the New Loyalty strategy set to launch in Q2-Q3 We will be looking to leverage the New Loyalty program when it launches, so we have therefore moved loyalty for Pets Table back by 1 quarter into Q3   

6. Cross Selling for other brands outside of HelloFresh and Factor is below the line for 2026 to be revisited for 2027 planning









Changes requested to the Yearly Plan during Draft Reviews. Please update before submission for final YP approval:  

* Move Loyalty on Pets Table by 1 quarter to Q3 to leverage  New Loyalty program launch 

* App Launch for Pets Table to become contingent on results of Elysium and ABBA app launches (both financial and performance KPIs)













	I. Organizational Overview

Mission and Focus areas

The New Ventures team aims to surprise and delight customers by bringing to life never-before-seen physical and digital products, changing the way everyone thinks about food. The domain scope for new ventures includes: Good Chop - delivering US consumers premium, locally sourced proteins via a digital butcher experience; The Pets Table - delicious and nutritious human-grade pet food for pet parents for all budgets and sizes & the Factor sub-brand Factor Form - supporting customers on their path towards holistic wellness and achieving their health goals;  Market Innovation - bringing customers brand new experiences across markets reinvigorating our relevance in their eyes.





Current Organizational Structure

The funded fixed HC for the New Ventures is 50. The management structure consists of 1 Director of Engineering (Daniel Arias) and 1 Director of Product (Nikita Gorshkov). Over the course of Q4 teams will settle into the new squad structure.  Overall New Ventures have self-funded with the exception of +2 from Growth to fund the Market Innovation squad.  *Final 2026 HC budget is under review with Finance and Portfolio given the recent org changes.

[i]1. Multipet checkout improvements (direct impact on improving AOR)

2. Increasing add on % of net revenue through add on subscribe & save, product marketing & UX (goal to increase add ons as a % of NR from 1% to 5% in 2026)

3. Other CVR initiatives e.g. testing other qus in the quiz (previous pet food, neutered/spayed, etc), personalised value reinforcing stats, etc

4. RAF initiatives on Tiered credit based on loyalty; RAF social proof & CVR improvements -> one of our goals for 2026 is to step change RAF





The team have this long list of initiatives and we will prioritise them through our quarterly planning.





The key thing is that we are resourced to tackle the vast majority of these and we've aligned on the resourcing for that. I can share with you in our call on Tuesday

[j]Aligned with Laurent on this, we have a good understanding of the overall capacity needs with the team based on the available initiative roadmap; this particular table/format was not aimed to be exhaustive of all of the work we aim to deliver in 2026.

one stream that's not present in here but we have as part of objectives and currently actively exploring is modernized CX leveraging AI: we are now looking at a few solutions that would augment CC, support sales funnel with live Q&A as well as retention flow (i.e. replace cancellation flow with native chat experience and go off the cancellation reason - solution) - this would need team support (data ingestion, PM steering, etc)

﻿TAM Product: GenAI Ways of Working

 

TAM Product: Context-driven Product Management

	Summary: In 2025, thanks to the growing maturity of AI-based tools and products, the tech industry shifted from theoretical possibility to practical necessity of integrating AI into the daily processes of employees; HelloFresh as well has actively engaged into the exploration, deployment and integration of AI-based tools into the workplace across functions. This document aims to offer each product manager within TAM an easy step-by-step guide and inspiration on how your daily workflow can (and should) change through the integration of AI into every step of your daily workflow.

Problem

Delivery, efficiency expectations of leadership across HelloFresh generally and HelloTech in particular is being recalibrated to address the reality of AI-augmented staff capabilities; simply put - more and faster will be expected from every team member; that would stretch everyone if not mitigated by automation of intelligence-based repetitive work through AI integration.





Principles

The principles for the new AI-enabled product manager ways of working are grounded in the core principles of the New Model proposed by Assaf Ronenon 16.09.2025: 

1. Customer First: Every decision must begin with the customer and be anchored in satisfaction, retention, and lifetime value.

2. One Global System: Wherever possible, we will converge on unified tools, processes, and standards, eliminating duplication.

3. Speed and Agility: We will shorten decision cycles and empower leaders to experiment, learn, and scale quickly.

4. Clear Accountability: Each decision will have a single owner with the authority and responsibility to deliver outcomes.

5. MD-Integrated Organization: Managing Directors (MDs) own the P&L for each geography. Central functions must be responsive, enabling local experimentation while ensuring it aligns with globally defined systems.









Solution

The solution to the growing problem of increased expectations is not only the training and learning of effective use of individual tools by product managers; but ensuring all individual tools can be combined into a comprehensive process, ensuring that core components, assets, artefacts, tools, best practices are reused, expanded, sustained and followed, empowering individuals to achieve peak performance within this new age. It’s important to establish a set of core principles that should be guiding your work: 





1. You are responsible: whatever you do and whatever you create and submit - there is no substitution from your personal responsibility, your content, data, findings, priorities etc. that might be generated by an AI are, at the end of the day, your responsibility. 

2. AI isn’t the end-all-be-all: AI can do some things well, others brilliantly, a lot - not so well, it is up to you to balance where to use AI, there is (despite the hype) no (and cannot be) any substitute for your creativity, passion, quality and communication - you are you with AI or without. 

3. Product principles are here to stay: our product principles, ways of thinking about customers and their problems, data and KPIs, goals, solutions and strategies are still as relevant as they were before - they will enable you to benefit from the new capabi

u are reporting out on - ensure that all MAR/QARs and tactical reports are added into the NotebookLM for your team - share the NotebookLM with the team and stakeholders. 









Conclusion

This document is not aimed to be comprehensive or cover every single aspect of product management and the SDLC process, this is not only impossible, but also would assume a static reality where processes and approaches would not change. Especially right now - that is not the case. We are all in a world where a new technology is changing the way we all work, this technology is in its infancy and lacks strong product cases, integrations and has existing limitations; this situation is similar to where product management was when the iPhone 1/2 were released - nobody knew where and how the technologies would evolve, how this changes product management and the products that we build; the key right now is for you to remain curious, flexible and quick - don’t focus too much on existing products and tools, focus on building your comfort level when working with GenAI, understand the fundamental benefits and limitations of the technology, ideate, experiment and try new things, build confidence when working with it and know where it’s particularly strong. 





Finally, the most important piece to remember is that this is just a technology, it’s up to us, humans to define how we use it and be responsible for the outcomes that we are able to achieve with it. Even in the last couple of weeks as this document was being written, more and more it became apparent that human input, guidance and effort is not going anywhere to ensure that we solve problems for other humans.









Temp: Notes

Note 1: add context-driven/spec driven development concepts





[a]Do you also mean by this that basically with making sure that everything is contextually described, the product manager should also know exactly what's in production because they can see the context that was used to generate certain production features?

[b]Yes, I don't expect that the product manager has the complete understanding of every single feature, but, I am expecting that a product manager orchestrates that the context of their domain is clear, maintained and relevant.

﻿Final YP





💡 Meeting Notes [To be filled after the Review Meeting by the YP Document Owner and sent out via email to attendees. This section does not impact the maximum number of pages]

Review Meeting Date: Oct 16, 2025

Attendees: Ed Boyes Assaf Ronen Dominik Richter Holger Hammel,Cho HwangAnnie MeininghausDina MehrezThomas GrieselFabien SimonMarlene RosnerBrian LeungAdriana VillarEvan WeintraubJama Musse





Key Takeaways, Decisions, and Next Steps:

1. Clarify how menu expansion plans, personalization roll outs  and app features come together: 

   * Elysium (new store and homepage in the app) roll out is fast followed by new app feature which benefits users  irrespective of menu ranking roll out (most notably merchandising widgets for marketing,  recommendation widgets,bringing search to apps, populating “most popular, “trending” widgets - details)

   * Menu ranking roll out: At the same time there is a roll out plan for menu ranking models which prioritizes P500 readiness in Q4/Q1 as well as Penguin for Factor US. Food Systems is trying to expedite Penguin for INTL if possible, prioritized after p500. Fall back is to launch Penguin Harp personalization to INTL markets expanding in Q1.  Other RTE markets in H2.

2. Share prioritization framework  for Project 5M. The prioritization is heavily influenced by successful companies and features observed (direct or indirect competitors) as well as through an internal workshop. This revealed a consistent and significant behavioral gap: Users enthusiastically save recipes (often from social media) but rarely act on them. This indicates a high desire for inspiration but a significant friction point in execution. This led to the prioritization of the recipe bridge in Q4/Q1. If requested we can  walk through the detailed methodology.

3. Decouple forecasting from personalization models. Food Systems to define technical interfaces enabling independent iteration. Once validated, assess org impact in Q1–Q2.

4. Reconcile marketing RAF plan with tech YP.  We have addressed the  gap between Marketing and Consumer growth targets. Share squad will focus on strengthening the Refer-a-Friend (RAF) program while building new in-product sharing loops to drive organic growth. prioritizing foundational fixes — improving data visibility, customer experience, and operational agility — to make the RAF program self-sufficient and easier to optimize without tech dependencies. 

5. Variable pricing is an urgently requested feature by markets. We added it  to the Market Innovation squad backlog H2. Will define long-term ownership before initiation as we are currently moving pricing ownership to growth MA. 





Changes requested to the Yearly Plan during Draft Reviews. Please update before submission for final YP approval:  

* Should we invest into an AOV-focused squad? Yes we will self fund a new AOV driven squad in Q2 with a dedicated KPI. Focus in Q1  is first to roll out the new personalized core journey including widgets and then layer in more upselling components. 

* Loyalty strategy across markets: We decided to reserve a small team to  maintain and improve the existing  program while implementing  the new vendor based loyalty program to launch first in  the US . See Loyalty Strategy SMT Shareout.

* Double check if all Factor requirements are in the plan: All documents were collected and integrated into the Market Innovation backlog. To be signed off by Ed Boyes

Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TQbbdGdYmSTYpNycSvHsAW8JP8l0EWBi--vW7X0CbU0/edit?usp=drivesdk
----------------------------------------

﻿Pilot: Crlhuth

Participant Details

Name: Connie

HelloFresh Experience: Has had HF in the past (she slipped through the screener)

Saves Recipes on Social Media: Daily

Cooks Recipes from Creators: A few times a week

# Food/Cooking Creators they Follow: More than 10





Current Habits

* Social Media Usage: Connie is a heavy social media user, primarily on Threads, Instagram, and TikTok. She consumes a significant amount of food content daily.

* Cooking Habits: She frequently cooks recipes found online (2–3 times a week), often modifying them or buying cookbooks from creators (e.g., B. Dylan Hollis, Joshua Weissman) to get clear written instructions.

* HelloFresh History: She is a former customer who loved the ingredient quality and service but canceled due to a lack of recipe variety.

* Household Needs: She cooks for a large household with the appetite equivalent of five adults.

________________





Reaction to the Concept

Connie’s overall reaction to the marketplace concept was highly positive, calling it "very innovative" and "exciting".

* Solves Key Pain Points: The concept addresses her two main issues:

   * Ingredient Waste: It eliminates the need to buy entire bottles of niche ingredients (e.g., red wine vinegar) for a single recipe.

   * Variety: It solves the boredom issue that originally caused her to leave HelloFresh by allowing her to curate a menu based on her favorite creators.

________________





Key Findings & Feedback

1. Pricing Sensitivity

* Cost Concern: Pricing is her primary concern. Because she feeds five adults, a significant price hike would make the service prohibitive.

* Expectation: She is willing to pay a "minor increase" for the influencer collaboration but stated she would not participate if the cost was significantly higher (e.g., a third higher) than standard meal kits.

* Creator Pricing: She is comfortable with creators setting their own margins, trusting that the creators she follows would price things fairly for their community.

2. Trust and Quality Control

* Vetting Process: Connie validates recipes by watching the video content first. If a creator is disorganized or unclear in a video, she assumes the written recipe will be poor and avoids it.

* Division of Responsibility: She expects HelloFresh to handle ingredient quality (which she already trusts) but believes the recipe quality is the influencer's responsibility.[a]

3. Feature Requests & UX Preferences

* Digital Cookbook: She desires a feature to consolidate and save recipes into a "digital cookbook" within the platform.

* Feedback Systems: She distinguishes between two types of communication:

   * Comments: For asking questions before cooking (on the recipe page).

      * She does not think recipe feedback would make sense to be added to the original social media post

   * Ratings: For providing feedback after cooking, which the influencer should use to adjust recipes.

* Curation Tools: She wants the ability to "heart" or follow specific creators and, crucially, a "mute" or "not interested" button to block specific creators and cuisines she dislikes.

* Video Integration: She expects the original video to be linked directly on the HelloFresh recipe page for reference.

﻿Final SOLUTION (WIP)

HelloFresh NL Premium Tier & Green Chef Migration - Solution Design Review





 Author(s): Vimal GargJolanta CariovaJoão Cheffer Prado

Last Update: Sep 25, 2025

Status: Draft | In Review | Final

Project Overview

This project consists of two sequential phases:

* M1: Green Chef NL to HelloFresh NL Migration

* M2: Premium Tier A/B Test for HelloFresh NL, BE & LU Active Customers

Key Questions

#

	Question

	Answer

	1

	How do we ensure seamless credential transition without requiring customers to create new passwords?

	We won’t reuse auth tokens. Customers will receive a magic link (or similar one-time login) to activate their new HelloFresh NL account, avoiding password creation at migration) however, they would still need to reset their password in case they log out from HF NL again since we cannot migrate password. We could support this with a clear password reset flow alongside the magic link.[a][b][c][d][e][f]

	2

	What's our approach for handling customers with existing HelloFresh accounts?[g]

	We could attach Premium Tier product-family to existing HF accounts with the same email instead of creating duplicates. This is technically feasible but would depend on a product (and legal) decision before implementation. All we need to do is basically changing their subscription plan to the newly created product-family for the premium tier.

João Cheffer Prado

	4

	What's the rollback plan if migration issues occur during W7 2026 delivery window?

	Customers would remain active on Green Chef, so rollback is essentially stopping the migration[h][i] job or just basically delete the “duplicated” account on HF NL or either require confirmation by email to validate before activation. Exact flow should be aligned with Product, but technically all options are possible.

	5

	How do we handle GDPR compliance[j] during the data migration process?

	Customer data is duplicated only for active NL customers with clear business purpose (service continuity) such as addresses and the payment token. Migration will follow GDPR principles: purpose limitation, data minimization (no historical orders[k][l][m]), audit trail, and secure handling in staging/production)

	6

	Green Chef Migration - Legal & Customer Segmentation?

* Can we migrate all active GC customers to Premium, or do we need consent-based opt-in due to BNL legal sensitivities?[n]

* How do we handle vegan/vegetarian customers where HF doesn't offer comparable options? (potential breach of dietary commitments)[o]

	



	7

	Pricing & Customer List Ownership

* MISSING: List of "high value" GC customers to be migrated[p] (who provides this list?)

	



	8

	Migration

* Cash credits / Hellocredit[q][r][s] migration approach - confirmed?

	



	9

	Preferences (to check with Katrien Oosterom) 

-  Can we have multiple different premium preferences (e.g., "Classic Premium" and "Healthy Premium")?

- any other challenges on preferences?[t]

	



	10

	Elysium[u] Dependencies & implications on timelines

- Jolanta Cariovato check if UX needs adjustments[v][w]

	



	11

	Experiment Allocation & Segmentation

* CDP or Statsig?

	



	12

	Data & Analytics

Tere Ledesma to define use cases and secure validation from the tech team. 





	



	13

	Technical[x] handover 

1. João Cheffer Pradoto cover how migration can work (POC done in the past[y][z][aa][ab])

2. Any other details on UX estimation /solution design

[hu]Alright, thanks!

[hv]@ra@hellofresh.com @gc@hellofresh.com can you please give feedback on this solution approach to enable preference management for NZ Saver plan

[hw]to check all the preference strings or the market default?

[hx]What is the market default?

[hy]@elyse.hill@hellofresh.co.nz who can answer this?

[hz]@rebecca.sukadana@hellofresh.com.au please can you confirm what the NZ Market default preference string is? TIA!

[ia]We currently in classic box have:

chefschoice (Classic - no choice)

family

veggie

quick

lowcalorie

lowcarb

protein

flexitarian





In saver plan

chefschoice (Classic - no choice)

[ib]I think there is also the use case of CC going in BOB or other CC tools and being able to change the preferences. Perhaps #squad-shopping-platform who own configuring the preferences in the backend know which clients consume them? Not sure if possible.

[ic]will check. I know in Bob and we are covering this in CC agent briefing.

[id]From our side, we do not need this. If the string is the same, the string is the same.

[ie]👍

[if]Theoretically no customer will have other pteference than chefchoice right? So this is rather a fallback in case they get a new preference somehow?

[ig]correct.

[ih]Why do we need this? Point f is a new feature (config hardcode). Shouldn't we trust that saver plan customers can only be allocated one preference?

[ii]agreed. removed it.

[ij]It should be totally fine.

[ik]👍

[il]1 total reaction

João Cheffer Prado reacted with 👍 at 2025-05-14 09:31 AM

[im]@jolanta.cariova@hellofresh.com can you check in context of NZ Saver if we need to communicate to customers that Saver plan comes with limited choice on the menu and explain what does having 1 option under preference mean?

1 total reaction

João Cheffer Prado reacted with 👍 at 2025-05-14 09:31 AM

[in]This is a valid risk, especially on the reactivation page where toggling plans affects menu preference visibility. We intentionally removed the single menu preference from the Saver plan on reactivation to avoid confusion as there would be no possibility to select anything, assuming that limited menu variety will be clear.

The Settings page offers more clarity, switching between plans shows 1 or 8 preferences, each with preference descriptions.

Let’s monitor this interaction and gather feedback to improve it if needed.

🛣️ Q2+Q3 Roadmap

Solenne, Ahmed, Tobias and I sat down and put our planned projects into a roadmap for Q2 and Q3. Tobias and Solenne presented this roadmap to Yoav and Annie and received good feedback about it. In the second tab of the spreadsheet we listed the priorities, with Porterhouse leading the list. Whenever we have to make a hard choice between two deliveries, we will decide for the one with the higher priority. That makes projects with lower priority more likely to be delayed than the ones with higher priority. If you have any concern of a high-priority project, please let Tobias and Solenne know as soon as possible.

We can expect the initiative to be complete early next week. There are still some cleaning up to do on web and mobile.

                                                                                                                                    * Last week we implemented a proof of concept of how we can migrate route access control to react components, and this we started with the migration of the access control function for the Cancellation page. By the end of next week, we should have also migrated the Delivery Tracking and RaF routes.

💸 Additional Vouchers

One of Engagement's sprint goals is to support Additional Vouchers in our price calculation logic for web and mobile. This week we started working on the website, refactoring the voucher Redux logic (🍝) and implementing the action to fetch a subscription's additional voucher info.

🔪 Killing Alice

This week we removed the last API call to Alice: update payment method in web. Before Alice is really killed in Intfood (expected mid April), we will need to do a force update of our mobile app to prevent users from using old versions that are still using the old endpoints.

🛒 Add-ons

The Happiness team started to implement some changes for Add-Ons, and was able to setup some add-ons SKUs in staging.

Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Laura Titherington, Jacob Gabiam - InComm, Nikita Gorshkov, Oliver Vicente, Phillip Pidoux-Koronya, and Elaine Tobin, among others, discussed the integration process and roles for HelloFresh’s new retail gift card program with InComm, covering the transferred value activation process, value management, and the use of PINs for redemption. Key technical and business requirements were debated, including InComm's ability to create custom-prefixed PINs, the data available in reporting for analytics (such as merchant name and location), and error handling with specific timeout thresholds and retry/cancel recommendations for "get status" and "redeem" requests. Participants also addressed the scope of integration, noting the preference for a variable load product from Elysa Viti and the need to finalize economics, particularly for the Costco program and the creation of separate or combined Canadian and US contracts, with Laura Titherington agreeing to inquire about a single North American agreement to simplify legal review for Elaine Tobin.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Meeting Setup and Introductions Laura Titherington addressed initial technical issues with Jacob Gabiam - InComm's audio connection (00:00:00). After resolving the audio problem, Laura Titherington stated that the purpose of the call was to discuss the transferred value integration and introduced Jacob Gabiam - InComm, who would answer questions, and Nikita Gorshkov, who would lead the discussion (00:01:25). A round of introductions followed, with attendees including Nikita Gorshkov (leading new ventures at HelloFresh) (00:02:29), Jacob Gabiam - InComm (Solutions Consultant at InComm) (00:03:29), Laura Titherington (Business Development for InComm Canada) (00:02:29), Oliver Vicente (Lead Channel Manager at InComm), Phillip Pidoux-Koronya (Director of Account Management at InComm Canada) (00:03:29), and Elaine Tobin (running gift cards and flyers for HelloFresh US/Factor) (00:04:36).

* Integration Process and Roles Jacob Gabiam - InComm outlined the steps for the integration, explaining that they would gather requirements and then send them out for PM assignment, with Oliver Vicente providing additional support until a Project Manager is assigned (00:03:29). Phillip Pidoux-Koronya clarified that their team will manage the relationship with HelloFresh, launch the product, and manage the program going forward after Laura Titherington hands off the contract. Elaine Tobin noted that HelloFresh is working as a North America unit to scope out and onboard with InComm for a new retail gift card program (00:04:36).

* Transferred Value Gift Card Activation Jacob Gabiam - InComm described the transferred value process for physical gift cards, where HelloFresh is not involved in the initial activation (00:05:38). The process involves the retailer scanning the IAB barcode, which InComm uses to mark the card as active for the requested amount. The consumer then uses the PIN on the back of the card to send a request to InComm via HelloFresh to validate the PIN and purchase; upon success, HelloFresh sends a redemption request, transferring the value. Nikita Gorshkov confirmed that the verification h

though um and see see what they if there's an opportunity to do a North American agreement for this. I I'm just not hopeful because they it hasn't been done in the past.

 

 

00:41:01

 

Elysa Viti: Okay. Like we're okay to have two different so it just like the main portion of the MSA usually is the same for both North um both countries.

Laura Titherington: Totally understand. Not typically how we do it. I will I will ask the question though.

Elysa Viti: Okay. Yeah. See if what your team can do. If not, like you said, if there was a red line version, you guys can provide. We just don't want that much. We don't want to create too much work for a procurement team, unnecessary extra work. Uh, and we don't want the US to have to launch a lot later than Canada.

Laura Titherington: Yeah.

Elysa Viti: We'd like to launch like similar timelines.

Elaine Tobin: Yeah.

Laura Titherington: Yeah, understood. So, let me take that back. Um, let me take that back. I I don't have an answer right now because I have to ask

Elysa Viti: Okay. All right.

Elaine Tobin: Yeah, I think the other thing of note is like given this request is going in after December 1st, I know our legal team isn't even going to like be able to review and finalize anything until like January. I think anything that we need signed off and reviewed the end of year was due a week ago. So like that's already setting our team back. If that means like Canada won't get finalized until sometime in January, then how long will it take for us, you know? So I think in terms of us like getting business case resourcing like US is just a much higher spend market. So we kind of need to be running in tandem for things to move on the Canadian side.

Laura Titherington: No problem. Let me see what we can do on our side.

Elaine Tobin: Okay.

Laura Titherington: All right.

Elysa Viti: Okay, we'll wait for the contract from you, Laura, and then if we have any questions.

Laura Titherington: Good. Yeah. So, I may hold on that until I get the answer of because there's no point in sending and unless, you know, because right now it as it stands, it's just a Canadian contract.

Elysa Viti: Yeah. Yeah. Okay, great. Awesome.

Elaine Tobin: Thank you.

Purpose,

,Overview of the Product & Engineering organization and members of the Consumer mega alliance. Complementing the limited views from workday and adaptive.

Context,

,The actual source of truth remains Workday for all employee data and reporting lines

,"In many cases managers have to have a way to plan ahead, to get an overview over a larger part of the org, to add more data like what programming languages someone can contribute in or a logical grouoping by triebs and squads. To avoid that everyone has to do the same work and to keep track of relevant metrics we maintain this central sheet for the whole alliance (Product, engineering)."

,The sheet is only shared with CS8+ managers. 

,For questions contact Holger Hammel

Main sheet - CMA,

,Please always use Filter views

,"CS8+ Tribe leads are responsible to keep the sheet up to date. This includes timely updates to status, dates of contract changes, reporting & squad assignments"

,TBD: how to sync and spot conflicts btw workday and adaptive and this sheet

,

(Dont change) Squad,

,"As indicated in the tab name, this view show the assignment of employees to squads."

,"The view is generated fromt the data in CMA, so please don't change any values"

(Copy to Overview)  Squads,

,Use this tab to COPY UNLINKED to other documents like Consumer Mega Alliance - Overview

Don't show in Squad view,

,"Set this checkbox to true if the person should not appear in the squad overview views. An example is if someone is on garden leave, then they would still appear in the list, but are not technically working in the squad anymore."

Values ...,

,Value Tabs are holding the values for dropdowns in CMA.

,"Adding or changing values impact those dropdowns and the validation, "

,"If a value has to change, e.g. a new squad or change of name, then change it here, and not on the dropdown fields in CMA"

Pivot,

,Various Pivot tables for analytics on the CMA data. 

,If you want to add new Pivots for a tribe etc please add a tab with preix Pivot:

Problem Statement

Social media has become a primary hub for culinary inspiration, where people turn to influencers to discover new recipes. While Followers struggle to find the necessary ingredients and an easy way to re-cook them, Influencers look for new revenue streams to be more independent from the heavily controlled platforms and find new ways to expand their reach and engage with their audiences authentically and organically via food.





Opportunity:

Hellofresh sees a huge opportunity to serve both: by transforming influencers' inspiration (recipe) into a shoppable, cookable meal kit for the consumers. 

By bridging the gap as the Expert in operation, warehouses and logistics, we provide customers a way to enjoy these recipes easily and the influencer to serve their followers and create a new revenue stream. The social commerce market is growing rapidly and can represent a huge opportunity for us to attract new customers.





Why now:

We see the urgency to act now, because influencers are already trying to solve this problem with links to ingredient orders  via Instacart or Pinterest partners with Instacart to enable 1-click grocery list generation from saved pins. But today, shoppable content on social media within the food category is often limited to individual food items as opposed to a holistic offering where the ingredients for entire recipes and direct delivery can be purchased. 





The Core Ask 

WBD: Influencer Marketplace

Explore desired and viable vision for a curated recipe creator marketplace (1. influencer, 2. Aggregators) with the option of an  instant purchase as a meal kit ‘fulfilled by HelloFresh’.





Long-term Vision (Later) 

Transform HelloFresh into the “Spotify for food”  a platform where any creator can share a recipe that HelloFresh fulfills.

Prototype Test

Prototype for evaluating the concept













[a]When you say trial run, I think we need to be clear with creators on what we mean here. Is this referring to paying an initial payment for their first time posting? Is there another 'trial' option we are considering?

[b]One thing that was pretty consistent with the influencers we already spoke with is that they aren't aware of other services like this. We may not get helpful feedback if we are comparing to other similar services. But I think understanding what missing features would increase the value overall is helpful to figure out

[c]I think in the script we can keep the intro we are already using and maybe shorten the section about them and their content. I think it would be important to get some context still on their content and background but maybe we just trim that down from what we had before so it doesn't take up as much time.

[d]Do we want to continue to cover anything from the previous sessions? I think getting some more data on how they follow trends might be helpful and I do want to ask about their pricing expectations around the 'set your own price' idea. I know they said they don't need data on it, but I think it would still be helpful to gather some since we won't have many opportunities to speak with influencers.

[e]Are we showing more concepts than what we walked through with the team last week?

[f]would we need to create a hellofresh shop with all influencer recipes to shop and the influencer itself advertise it?

Refund from Owl for C@C

Invited Beatrice Dimarucut Shishir Mishra Hagag Nikita Gorshkov

Attachments Refund from Owl for C@C 

Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Beatrice Dimarucut reported that refunds are failing for initial orders of customers in the "charge at checkout" (CSC) experiment, unlike standard "Business As Usual" (BAU) customers charged at cutoff, and noted the difficulty in isolating defective cases because the CSC allocation is not visible in Owl. Shishir Mishra and Hagag debated the consistency of the issue, with Hagag noting that Bob and Owl use the same refund service endpoint, while Shishir Mishra confirmed that Owl does not display customer experiment allocation. Hagag and Shishir Mishra also discussed the difference between the Owl Orders tab, which uses the updated refund service like Bob, and the "error reporting" tab, which may use an older RabbitMQ topic for refund requests.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Refund Issues for 'Charge at Checkout' Customers Beatrice Dimarucut reported that refunds are not working for customers allocated to the "charge at checkout" (CSC) experiment, specifically for initial orders, unlike standard "Business As Usual" (BAU) customers who are charged at cutoff (00:00:00). Beatrice Dimarucut clarified that the allocation to CSC happens on the payments page, and this allocation is not visible in Owl (00:01:03). They also noted that any changes are only happening on initial orders (00:02:17).

* Investigating Refund Mechanism Differences Shishir Mishra and Beatrice Dimarucut discussed the lack of multiple examples of the defect occurring consistently on Owl, suggesting it may not be a systemic issue (00:03:39) (00:06:02). Hagag added that Bob (a system where a refund worked for Beatrice Dimarucut) and Owl use the same refund service endpoint, questioning why there would be a difference in behavior. Shishir Mishra suggested involving Ganga or Diana, who are on the payment operation team, to confirm if Bob and Owl are using the exact same refund endpoint (00:04:42).

* Addressing Challenges with Isolating Defective Cases Beatrice Dimarucut explained the difficulty in finding more examples because only 10% of customers are allocated to the experiment, and only 5% of those are allocated to "charge at checkout," which makes it hard for customer care agents to identify the relevant customers due to the lack of visibility in Owl. Shishir Mishra confirmed that Owl does not show which experiment a customer is allocated to, suggesting the need for UIDs or CIDs from Star to be passed to customer agents (00:07:03). The team agreed to test a new live order and attempt a refund to replicate the issue (00:08:21).

* Error Reporting vs. Orders Tab for Refunds Hagag explained that the Orders tab in Owl has a specific refund button that uses the updated refund service, mimicking Bob's functionality (00:09:33). Hagag and Shishir Mishra debated the functionality of the "error reporting" tab, with Hagag noting that it might use an older method of publishing a refund request via a RabbitMQ topic rather than the new endpoint (00:11:11) (00:13:54). Shishir Mishra agreed to investigate with the team responsible for error reporting to ensure it works the same as the new refund button (00:17:09).

* Procedure for Live Order Refund and Cancellation Beatrice Dimarucut agreed to create a new live order and attempt a refund via the Orders tab, recording the steps (00:08:21) (00:17:09). Beatrice Dimarucut clarified the need to first issue the refund and then cancel the order, a

... [TRUNCATED: 16071 chars omitted to save context] ...

o not end point. There is a top a rapid MQ that publishes refund which is not the same as the endpoint.

Shishir Mishra: Yeah, no worries.

Hagag: But again I I am not sure this is just

Shishir Mishra: Let's check this out of this meeting. But uh now we address when you when you do that uh refund in case any order please do also record the screen so that we know exactly the steps that you are taking and just in case if there

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah.

Shishir Mishra: is any other modification to it.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Okay, sounds good. Um, so what I'll do is like first do the refund, but I like in the VAU process as far as I understand because customers don't actually want this box.

 

 

00:18:26

 

Beatrice Dimarucut: So it's not just about refunding, I also will have to cancel it after. So I will also do that after I issue the refund. Um, okay. I will do that and then I'll I'll just keep you guys posted on the channel. Um but just to like to understand like shishir you don't want to reopen Bob for all for customer care agents of good job because it's not possible on a market basis or like what's the

Shishir Mishra: It's um so it's 1500 agents enabled at a go. Uh so switch on and switch off. So it's not very market based or at least not very direct without putting a a decent effort. We can't uh switch it off for a given market.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Okay. And um so I'm I'm to be fair I'm not familiar with like the agent structure like by L who are like L2 agents. They're not the first responders of the call, right?

Shishir Mishra: one are the first responders uh they will have the so how how it happens today as well so there are payment L2 teams uh in CC and then the first responders are called L1 so request will come to L1 L1 will escalate it to L2 and L2 will resolve the problem.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Okay.

Shishir Mishra: Okay. Yeah, I think that CC process or CC all established uh in your CC good job channel if you uh let them know that this is how you need to operate uh I think it'll be okay. Um what I'm assuming is you won't have to uh if you refund via via orders tab and don't use error reporting in in that manner and agents are trained on it so should not be a problem.

,Q1 capitalization audit

,Please follow the instructions below 

Step 1,Go to the tab of your respective alliance

Step 2,"Verify Column G - Finance/Portfolio Decision , for the final decision on Capitalisation of the KR."

,"If you want to challenge this decision, please change Column H - Do you want to challenge the decision? to Yes. Provide supporting commentary in Column I - Comment."

Step 3,Verify Column J - Check Questions to understand which question you need to answer:

,A - Provide evidence this KR results in the creation of assets in Column I - Comment.

,"B - Check column L - B. Does the KR result in economic benefit?

If the cell is highlighted with ‘Oops, there is no YP strategy provided for this KR’  you need to provide the YP/QAR strategy this KR is associated with on the OKR Management Tool - Column AP (Input - Tech Strategy) or you need to explain why this KR is associated with a strategy with an economic benefit.

If the cell is highlighted with ‘This KR is associated with KTLO but we believe it delivers benefit and results in the creation of assets. Please advise',  you need to help us map this KR to an economic benefit.

If the cell is highlighted with ‘KR not found on the OKR Tool’, please help us map days reported to another KR."

,"C - Change value in column M - C. Percentage of work reported in cap activities YTD that is actually capitalisable if the KR is set to not meet or canceled, if it is partially capitalisable, or if there is need to ensure teams are not reporting non-capitalisable activities.

You can also use this column to correct the number of capitalisable days if there were mistakes in the reporting during the previous months (see FAQ 3 for more details)."

,"If the column is “-” there are no open question to address and if there are more than one item (i.e. B, C) please address both questions."

AI-Native Product Development Handbook

Publish date: Oct 23, 2025, Last updated at: Oct 28, 2025

* Driver: Pepijn Senders

Welcome, trailblazers! You are part of a team fundamentally reshaping how we build software. We've redesigned our product development lifecycle (PDLC) around a simple truth: AI enables us to work in a common, natural language, we demo daily, and learn faster.

The Next Leap in Productivity

To understand why this shift is so important, it’s helpful to look at the evolving role of the engineer. Historically, from the era of the "chief programmer team" to today, the value an engineer can add per minute has constantly increased as tools and processes have improved. The focus was on producing code more efficiently.

We are now at the next major leap. With AI handling much of the heavy lifting in code generation, engineers are able to "shift left": applying their critical problem-solving skills much earlier in the development cycle. This means they can help shape product specifications, ensure technical feasibility from day one, and contribute across the entire value stream. This transforms the engineer's role from a builder who executes a plan to a true partner in defining what gets built.

The Core Philosophy

AI-Native is about speed, clarity, and alignment. Our new way of working is guided by a few key principles:

* 🤖 Human-in-the-Loop, AI-in-the-Flow: The AI handles the heavy lifting, but pauses for human intelligence when it encounters ambiguity, empowering us to focus on creative problem-solving.

* 💬 Natural Language is the Source Code: We collaborate through clear, concise markdown files that are optimized to produce working software.

* ✨ E2E Alignment from a Single Source: We drive end-to-end alignment by using a single, clear specification as the source of truth, ensuring Product, UX, and Engineering are always building the same thing.

* 🚢 Demo Daily, Ship Weekly: We demonstrate tangible progress every day, creating a tight feedback loop that culminates in a valuable shipment to production every week.

* 🤝 We Build on a Supported Stack: To ensure consistency and velocity, we build upon a common foundation of supported tools and practices. The golden path relies on a standardized toolchain to prevent fragmentation.

How to Use This Handbook

This handbook details our new AI-Native workflow, which is based on learnings from a pre-pilot stage with several early-adopter teams. We are now moving into a formal pilot phase until the end of Q1 2026, and we are actively looking for more teams to join us. While the framework is designed for teams, many principles and playbooks can be adopted by individuals looking to improve their personal workflows.

* During the Pilot (Now - EoQ1): This is an opt-in phase. We want teams to use these playbooks, "learn first," and help us refine them by encountering and solving issues. Your feedback is critical.

* Post-Pilot (After Q1): Once the pilot concludes, this refined handbook will become the "golden path" for all teams.

* Track the Pilot: Want to add your team or see who else is participating? Check out theAI-Native Pilot Teams.

This is a living document that will evolve based on your team's experiences.

There’s no TL;DR, you need to learn how to work AI-Native, before diving in:

ed context from the "pre-pilot stage."

                                             * Included a placeholder link for the pilot teams tracking sheet.

                                             * Introduced Playbook Maturity Ratings: Replaced text disclaimers with a star-rating system (⭐☆☆ to ⭐⭐⭐) to show playbook stability.

                                             * Refined Core Philosophy: Added "E2E Alignment from a Single Source" back into the principles.

                                             * Refactored Onboarding: Created a new, standalone "AI-Native Onboarding" guide. This clarifies the "Team Accelerator Session" as the recommended path and lists specific champions (Ebrahim, Pepijn, Brian), time commitments, and the #ai-native-pdlc Slack channel.

I have some feedback based on our experience running this in Inspire Squad, sharing in case it helps refine the framing a bit.





Right now the “Discovery Track” feels more like a define/refinement phase vs true discovery. Every Monday, PM, Eng, and UX we are already working together to shape the work, give feedback, ask clarifying questions, and surface technical constraints. 





From design side specifically, I need ~1–2 weeks lead time for MCP-ready specs, so by Monday we’re already tightening accessibility, copy, UI states, etc. Feels like convergence, not exploration.





For me, actual Discovery is the earlier stuff — exploring ideas, prototyping with AI, validating problems, testing directions. That’s where we figure out what to build next, not finalize how we're building it. [e.g we are running a workshop next week to build up new ideas]





The delivery track: in our experience, is that the Monday review often came too late for meaningful changes. We’d end up spending a long time in that meeting, and sometimes big questions came up that we didn’t have time to dig into properly. It became more of a “final confirmation + unblock any last details” moment vs actual spec shaping. Maybe worth calling that out so expectations match reality.

Summary



Laura Titherington, Jacob Gabiam - InComm, Nikita Gorshkov, Oliver Vicente,  

Phillip Pidoux-Koronya, and Elaine Tobin, among others, discussed the  

integration process and roles for HelloFresh's new retail gift card program  

with InComm, covering the transferred value activation process, value  

management, and the use of PINs for redemption. Key technical and business  

requirements were debated, including InComm's ability to create  

custom-prefixed PINs, the data available in reporting for analytics (such  

as merchant name and location), and error handling with specific timeout  

thresholds and retry/cancel recommendations for "get status" and "redeem"  

requests. Participants also addressed the scope of integration, noting the  

preference for a variable load product from Elysa Viti and the need to  

finalize economics, particularly for the Costco program and the creation of  

separate or combined Canadian and US contracts, with Laura Titherington  

agreeing to inquire about a single North American agreement to simplify  

legal review for Elaine Tobin.





Suggested next steps





Laura Titherington will review the agreement and send it over as a draft to  

Elysa Viti and Aniva Lu today.



Laura Titherington will inquire about the level of interest from Walmart in  

working with HelloFresh on the gift card program for the 2026 launch.



Elysa Viti and Aniva Lu will go back with the analytics team after the call  

to figure out the pin requirements, including any prefix, and let Jacob  

Gabiam - InComm know.



Jacob Gabiam - InComm will send a quick recap email after the meeting and  

pinpoint where to find the list of response codes that are applicable to  

the transferred value integration.



Laura Titherington will follow up with the HelloFresh team regarding a  

potential North American agreement or a red line version of the contract  

and send the Canadian contract for their review.

Notes from “Refund from Owl for C@C”



These notes have been sent to invited guests in your organization.



Open meeting notes



The content was auto-generated on December 8, 2025, 1:39 PM CET and may  

contain errors.





Summary



Beatrice Dimarucut reported that refunds are failing for initial orders of  

customers in the "charge at checkout" (CSC) experiment, unlike  

standard "Business As Usual" (BAU) customers charged at cutoff, and noted  

the difficulty in isolating defective cases because the CSC allocation is  

not visible in Owl. Shishir Mishra and Hagag debated the consistency of the  

issue, with Hagag noting that Bob and Owl use the same refund service  

endpoint, while Shishir Mishra confirmed that Owl does not display customer  

experiment allocation. Hagag and Shishir Mishra also discussed the  

difference between the Owl Orders tab, which uses the updated refund  

service like Bob, and the "error reporting" tab, which may use an older  

RabbitMQ topic for refund requests.





Suggested next steps





Beatrice Dimarucut will create another live order, refund it via the orders  

tab and cancel it as part of the BAU process, recording the screen, and  

keeping the group posted on the channel.



Hagag will check if the customer complaint service has any connection to  

the refund service and how it happens.



Shishir Mishra will talk to the appropriate team to ensure error reporting  

works the same as the refunds button.



Shishir Mishra will add Hagag to the channel to share the refunds endpoint.



Hagag will check who is responsible for the refund service from the RFC.
