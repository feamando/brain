Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Jenna O'Shea and Nikita Gorshkov discussed the immediate need to hire a mid-level designer for the Good Chop replacement position, with Jenna O'Shea preferring a mid-level role for long-term growth and Nikita Gorshkov emphasizing the candidate's need to be systematic. Regarding team management, Jenna O'Shea committed to being more hands-on and coaching Mega on stakeholder management, while they also decided to bundle design critiques for New Ventures and Shopping to promote knowledge transfer and suggested involving Nikita Gorshkov or Daniel in the hiring interviews. They also discussed Nikita Gorshkov’s concern over the VMS Shopify store's templated design and "lack of ownership," and established the Factor Form strategy of integrating it into Factor if the Shopify store fails.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Initial Check-in and AI Context Jenna O'Shea and Nikita Gorshkov started the meeting with a brief check-in, where Jenna O'Shea apologized for not accessing the AI pre-read due to connection issues at their new place. Nikita Gorshkov reassured them that the AI's current pre-reads may not be 100% accurate yet because it lacks past context, comparing it to a "baby Nikita" that is still learning and will become more accurate over time (00:00:00).

* Personal Update on Baby's Sleep Nikita Gorshkov shared positive news that they had managed to sleep at the same time as their baby during their shift for two consecutive days. They explained that the baby had initially refused to sleep on any flat surface, despite advice, but they found success with co-sleeping, with the baby taking "center stage" in the bed (00:01:05). Jenna O'Shea congratulated them, emphasizing that what works for their family is what matters, as not "everything is textbook" (00:02:11).

* Hiring Strategy for Good Chop Position Jenna O'Shea identified the key topic as hiring a replacement for David, and specifically, opening a mid-level position for Good Chop as soon as possible, with an intention to open it in January (00:02:11). Jenna O'Shea expressed a preference for hiring a mid-level designer to allow for long-term growth and avoid the cycle of quickly hiring and losing momentum with senior roles, given the team's seniority and the nature of the design work in that space (00:03:16).

* Team Strength and Management Strategy Jenna O'Shea observed that the design team is "really solid" and demonstrated a strong community, citing an example of Marina onboarding Shay onto tasks despite Katrina and Pedro being out, which Jenna O'Shea identified as a leadership issue. Jenna O'Shea is committed to being more hands-on to address "Yuri level frustrations," and intends to coach Mega on stakeholder management once they return in August (00:04:06). Nikita Gorshkov agreed with the mid-level hiring but emphasized the importance of the candidate being systematic in their work to avoid the previous problem of constantly designing new components instead of reusing existing ones (00:06:17).

* Recommendations for Design Collaboration and Hiring Process To ensure a systematic approach, Jenna O'Shea recommended bundling design critiques for New Ventures and Shopping together, anticipating "healthy friction" and knowledge transfer between the system-focused HelloFresh side and the more explorative New Ventures side. Regarding the hiring process for the mid-level role, Jenna O'Shea suggested involving Nikita Gorshkov or Daniel

Nikita Gorshkov: Um and then yeah with TPT honestly we have Katrina and I'm very happy with Katrina's work so far. So so far so good there. Uh, I think that's less of a prevalence. And then, yeah, uh, I'm gonna ping Shay to maybe ping you and also, you know, do a demo and things like that. What we need to solve for our factor forum subbrands are UX issues. And I think if you I don't know if you already went through some of the experiences and the funnel and things like that on factor forum. Um, but if you haven't, please do. That would be super helpful because I think you'll see what I'm talking about when me and Hamemed are saying that we need to fix the UX

Jenna O'Shea: Um,

Nikita Gorshkov: there.

Jenna O'Shea: so I already asked Michael, who's on factor form as point of contact, to go ahead and do an audit on that for us,

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah.

Jenna O'Shea: like a UX audit.

Nikita Gorshkov: Oh, yeah. Michael, sorry. Sorry, that was a mixup.

 

 

00:15:23

 

Nikita Gorshkov: Michael.

Jenna O'Shea: Yeah. So, I mean, uh,

Nikita Gorshkov: Yep.

Jenna O'Shea: feel free to to put Yumi and Michael into a conversation and like just kind of like a closing the loop kind of statement because that is really what I would expect him to do next. He said that he had done a UX audit for factor form when he started, but then this was spinning up la. Um, so let's actually have him put that effort into this because it sounds like he has a really big appetite to be a key voice in strategy and experience experience strategy here. also seems like he's pretty experienced, so let's leverage

Nikita Gorshkov: Nice. Perfect.

Jenna O'Shea: Sweet. Okay, I have nothing urgent from my side other than like I'm still newbie, still on boarding. If there's anything I'm getting wrong or anything I need to be learning while I'm being loud in these rooms, please let me know. If there are any other rooms that I'm supposed to be in that I'm not, please let me know. From a design perspective, you'll have a little bit more visibility over who's doing what uh than before. Uh cuz I realized that the new brand's Jira board is the one that I set up sometime around 2019 2020.

Nikita Gorshkov: Thanks. Awesome.

Invited Nikita Gorshkov Elysa Viti

Attachments Connect on CA B2B Shopify Integration 

Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Elysa Viti initiated a discussion with Nikita Gorshkov about the Canadian B2B site, which requires Shopify as middleware because no current systems, except Katana, support the necessary B2B functionality out of the box; the site aims to automate small business employee orders (Factor only), which are currently manual and error-prone. Nikita Gorshkov emphasized that the success of B2B depends on a strong sales presence, and confirmed that zero people are currently allocated to B2B development, with expectations that a dedicated B2B team may be pushed for around June, leading Elysa Viti to estimate a Q3 launch for the Shopify integration. The strategy for the first half of the year involves manually testing streams like sports teams and gyms, and Elysa Viti suggested a separate team should handle B2B.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Initial Scope and Technical Challenges for B2B in Canada Elysa Viti initiated the discussion to scope the work required for a B2B site in Canada, noting it seemed to involve more work than initially expected (00:00:00). Nikita Gorshkov explained the complexities, emphasizing that none of their current systems, except for Katana, support the required B2B functionality out of the box, necessitating the use of Shopify as a middleware solution for consolidation (00:03:20). They also detailed the need for extensive integration with retailers or businesses for order placement, inventory management, and the requirement for a CRM system, mentioning a possible transition to HubSpot (00:04:29).

* Sales Presence and Commercial Support for B2B Nikita Gorshkov stressed that the success of B2B, particularly for physical goods, heavily relies not on tech, but on a strong sales presence and field team to build relationships (00:04:29). Elysa Viti noted that the Canadian B2B initiative involves only them and their direct report, and they will not be doing fieldwork (00:05:38). Elysa Viti clarified that the main purpose of the Canadian B2B site is to facilitate small businesses placing orders for their employees (Factor only, not HelloFresh), with a current manual ordering system leading to errors and requiring a Shopify integration to automate the process. They do not foresee using it for retail immediately, aiming to unlock small businesses first (00:06:51).

* Timeline and Resource Allocation for B2B Development Elysa Viti plans to discuss the business case with Kieran to adapt it for Canada and determine a timeline for integration (00:07:55). Nikita Gorshkov revealed that there are currently zero people allocated to B2B within their funding, and they anticipate that Adam and Factor, along with Ed, may push for a dedicated B2B team around June (00:08:58). This timeline suggests that dedicated work on the B2B site would likely start in June. Elysa Viti estimated that the development, which they suggested might take about a month since it's based on the US system, means a realistic launch for the Shopify integration would be in Q3 (00:09:56) (00:13:46).

* Strategy and Team Structure for Canadian B2B Elysa Viti described their strategy for the first half of the year (until June), which includes manually testing streams like sports teams, gyms, and private retail locations (e.g., universities) (00:12:58). Elysa Viti expressed concern about managing both growth and revenue and suggested a separate team should handle B2B, similar

lready told you know our I don't know if you know Kevin he's our um our I think he's what's his title? What is Kevin's title? Hold on. Um I think he is he's a DM for Factor Canada. He's basically online.

Nikita Gorshkov: Uh, okay.

Elysa Viti: He's online.

Nikita Gorshkov: Okay.

Elysa Viti: He He's good with us testing out a few things until we get this Shopify integration going. So I'm just going to give him the timeline that you know we don't have a dedicated team to this right now who will be able to support in the first half of the year getting this online. So we're looking at it'll the work will start in June not finish it like this is this is K is submitted JAMA or the team takes it away I don't

Nikita Gorshkov: H.

Elysa Viti: know once you guys have it three four weeks I don't know how long it might take like a month

Nikita Gorshkov: Huh?

Elysa Viti: or so I'm guessing um because it's really just the same system as that exists in the US just copy paste for Canada I'm saying copy paste but I know it's not that easy

 

 

00:14:52

 

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah. Yeah. It's It never is.

Elysa Viti: u a version of that.

Nikita Gorshkov: It never is.

Elysa Viti: Um, so about a month after,

Nikita Gorshkov: Right.

Elysa Viti: so we're looking at realistically Q3.

Nikita Gorshkov: Okay.

Elysa Viti: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: I think that's I think that's okay.

Elysa Viti: Okay. Okay.

Nikita Gorshkov: I mean,

Elysa Viti: Got it.

Nikita Gorshkov: it's not unreasonable.

Elysa Viti: All right.

Nikita Gorshkov: There we go.

Elysa Viti: Yeah. Yeah. This is a lot of work um for both you and I at this point. So, I just need to set realistic expectations with SLT that, you know, we don't have the resources. Things can't get done as fast as they would like. We need more people. Yeah. Okay. All right.

Nikita Gorshkov: Nice.

Elysa Viti: I think um I think that's it for now from me. Um I'm going to forward all these notes over to Kevin to Cole, our director of growth,

Nikita Gorshkov: Mhm.

Elysa Viti: just for him to, you know, they can read up on it. If they have any questions, I'll let you know. But for now, I think we're okay. Okay. Thank you. And I'll keep you posted on income.

🛣️ Q2+Q3 Roadmap

Solenne, Ahmed, Tobias and I sat down and put our planned projects into a roadmap for Q2 and Q3. Tobias and Solenne presented this roadmap to Yoav and Annie and received good feedback about it. In the second tab of the spreadsheet we listed the priorities, with Porterhouse leading the list. Whenever we have to make a hard choice between two deliveries, we will decide for the one with the higher priority. That makes projects with lower priority more likely to be delayed than the ones with higher priority. If you have any concern of a high-priority project, please let Tobias and Solenne know as soon as possible.

💻 Tech Initiatives

                                                                                                                                    * The BFF migration in the mobile app is almost almost almost complete. We can expect the initiative to be complete early next week. There are still some cleaning up to do on web and mobile.

                                                                                                                                    * Last week we implemented a proof of concept of how we can migrate route access control to react components, and this we started with the migration of the access control function for the Cancellation page. By the end of next week, we should have also migrated the Delivery Tracking and RaF routes.

💸 Additional Vouchers

One of Engagement's sprint goals is to support Additional Vouchers in our price calculation logic for web and mobile. This week we started working on the website, refactoring the voucher Redux logic (🍝) and implementing the action to fetch a subscription's additional voucher info.

🔪 Killing Alice

This week we removed the last API call to Alice: update payment method in web. Before Alice is really killed in Intfood (expected mid April), we will need to do a force update of our mobile app to prevent users from using old versions that are still using the old endpoints.

🛒 Add-ons

The Happiness team started to implement some changes for Add-Ons, and was able to setup some add-ons SKUs in staging.

﻿Interview: Cheatdayeats

Influencer: Jessica Hirsch of Cheatdayeats

Main Socials: Instagram, Tiktok

Following Size: Instagram 559K, Tiktok: 114K

Content focus: Comfort food with with interesting twists and formats

Interview Date: Nov. 14, 2025

Part 1: Creator Background

* Primary Goal: Her main goal is building a strong community and establishing trust with her followers. She wants her content to be accessible, fun, and easy, focusing on recipes that are not overly complex (e.g., 5 ingredients, 15 minutes).

* Content & Platforms: Her content has evolved from featuring restaurants to focusing on her own recipes.

   * Her main platforms are Instagram and TikTok, but she is also building on YouTube, Facebook, and Threads.

   * She noted that her Instagram audience feels more like a "hardcore" community, while TikTok feels more random and driven by the "For You" page.

   * She tailors content, finding that TikTok performs better with longer, descriptive videos, whereas Instagram favors short, quick videos.

* Workflow & Tools: She works as a two-person team with her husband. He assists with filming and emails, while she handles most of the editing and community engagement. She uses Capcut and Premiere Pro for editing.

* Monetization: Her income is primarily from brand deals and creating UGC (User-Generated Content) for brands. She makes some money from the TikTok fund but finds the monetization rules across platforms to be confusing and hard to keep up with.

* Biggest Challenges:

   * The Algorithm: Her single biggest challenge is connecting with her audience due to the "ebb and flow" of platform algorithms. She struggles to know if low engagement is due to her content or the algorithm simply not showing it to her followers.

   * Time & Trends: As a small team, she finds it challenging to be consistent and invest time across all platforms. If she could delegate one task, it would be keeping up with all the different platform-specific trends, audios, and algorithm changes.

________________





Part 2: The HelloFresh Concept & Feedback

Value Proposition

* Her initial concern was cost and timeliness versus just using Instacart.

* However, she quickly saw the value in providing exact, pre-portioned ingredients, noting she has also bought an expensive spice just to use it once.

* She felt the concept would be especially powerful for recipes involving unique, expensive, or hard-to-find ingredients, like pistachio paste for the viral Dubai chocolate trend.

Ingredient Strategy & Value

The core value for users will come from the ingredients. Jessica stressed that the program must:

* Focus on Unique/Specialty Items: The program's biggest draw would be providing ingredients that are hard to find, expensive, or unique. This creates a clear value-add over a user just going to their local supermarket.

* Highlight Pre-Portioned Savings: The program should emphasize the value of providing exact portions of expensive ingredients (like saffron or pistachio paste) so the user doesn't have to buy a large, costly jar for a single recipe.

* Ensure High-Quality Ingredients: Jessica was very clear that the quality of the ingredients is critical. She noted that for recipes with few ingredients, the quality matters a lot (e.g., "which sharp cheddar" is being used).

Creator-Follower Connection

The program must be designed to enhance, not just use, the creator's existing community.

* Create a "Full Circle" Loop: Jessica suggested including a QR code or link in the box that directs the user back to the creator's original post, website, or

cess involved. Additionally a personal concern would be the minimum guarantees to commit to the ingredient supplier or subsequent overstocking issues due to poor recipe uptake.

[e]There needs to be a minimum number of recipes to start with for the offering to look meaningful

[f]While this is possible in the beginning when we are handholding recipe creation, in the long run this can become a scalability issue. I am curious, though what did she mean by vetting?

[g]I don't expect we would do this

[h]In the second interview, we also saw an assumption that we would pay for the effort to upload a recipe. If it comes up in the session today, I can dig into that a bit more and understand their perspective on that kind of pre-sales payment not being provided.

[i]Thanks. I think the idea of what we want to convey is that the more they get their followers to order the recipes, they more they earn.

[j]This is earning for outputs, not paying for inputs

[k]@katheryn.eckles@hellofresh.com - do we know for amazon storefront if amazon is paying any of the creators for the content or only based on commission?

[l]From all of the documentation around the amazon storefront that I have found, it looks like it is only based on commission. In future interviews I can probe into their experience with the amazon storefront though and see if there are any other experiences with it. And see how they feel about this program's compensation being structured like the Amazon storefront.

[m]Note that this is different from the expected payout method of the prior two participants who wanted an initial incentive for uploading/posting about the recipe, and commission on sales.

[n]With Kay I dove a little deeper into how her brand deals work to answer some of the questions around this that came up in our sync this week.

[o]Suggestion: For onboarding influencers to this program, a base fee might be the best route for early creators who have no evidence of what this may look like. Once we get enough data to provide examples and estimates, creators may be more comfortable investing time to see if it will work for them.

[p]If this would be a menu to choose from, yes, but for now the creator becomes the storefront so I dont see this as a problem

Problem Statement

Social media has become a primary hub for culinary inspiration, where people turn to influencers to discover new recipes. While Followers struggle to find the necessary ingredients and an easy way to re-cook them, Influencers look for new revenue streams to be more independent from the heavily controlled platforms and find new ways to expand their reach and engage with their audiences authentically and organically via food.





Opportunity:

Hellofresh sees a huge opportunity to serve both: by transforming influencers' inspiration (recipe) into a shoppable, cookable meal kit for the consumers. 

By bridging the gap as the Expert in operation, warehouses and logistics, we provide customers a way to enjoy these recipes easily and the influencer to serve their followers and create a new revenue stream. The social commerce market is growing rapidly and can represent a huge opportunity for us to attract new customers.





Why now:

We see the urgency to act now, because influencers are already trying to solve this problem with links to ingredient orders  via Instacart or Pinterest partners with Instacart to enable 1-click grocery list generation from saved pins. But today, shoppable content on social media within the food category is often limited to individual food items as opposed to a holistic offering where the ingredients for entire recipes and direct delivery can be purchased. 





The Core Ask 

WBD: Influencer Marketplace

Explore desired and viable vision for a curated recipe creator marketplace (1. influencer, 2. Aggregators) with the option of an  instant purchase as a meal kit ‘fulfilled by HelloFresh’.





Long-term Vision (Later) 

Transform HelloFresh into the “Spotify for food”  a platform where any creator can share a recipe that HelloFresh fulfills.

,Accessibility-2025 Program,,,,,,,,,,Recent action Items,,,,,,

,Welcome! The Accessibility-2025 Program will enable HelloFresh Group to complete HelloTech Objective #4 and comply with the modern level of accessibility for our customers driven by The European Accessibility Act (EAA). The program has two goals:,,,,,,,,,,🔄,"Resolve 90% of the P1 issues identified through Cypress that break 11 WCAG rules and manual audits in WEB.
Deadline: December 31st.",,,,,

,1,"Reduce the number of ""important"" Accessibility issues in HelloFresh, GreenChef, and Factor by 90% in WEB experiences by 28 June 2025, and in Mobile experiences by 31 Dec 2025.",,,,,,,,,🔄,"Resolve 90% of the P0 issues identified through Cypress that break 4 WCAG rules and manual audits in REACT NATIVE.
Deadline: December 31st.",,,,,

,2,Establish accessibility standards to support future HelloTech product development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Current P90 compliance,,,,,,source

,Background,,,,,,,,,,WEB,,,,MOBILE,,

,"The European Accessibility Act (EAA), which mandates that websites and mobile applications comply with WCAG 2.2 Level AA accessibility standards, will come into effect on June 28, 2025. The directive applies to all businesses in the EU, including HelloFresh. Non-compliance can result in penalties such as fines (ranging from 500–500k€) or, in some countries like Ireland, even prison sentences. Companies may also face legal action from disability advocacy groups.",,,,,,,,,,35%,,,,15%,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Remediating the risk of fines requires a company-wide collaboration, which is the background of launching this program. Apart from avoiding fines, improved Accessibility in our interfaces also gives us access to new potential customers (with disposable income) who previously may not have considered our product because they functionally were prevented from doing so. There is no calculated business case for the Group yet, but we plan to dig deeper into the opportunity in H2. The program will be driven by Foundations Alliance and involve all CFAs teams owning Front End TRE in mobile or web.",,,,,,,,,,2025 compliance target,,,,,,source

,,,,,,,,,,,WEB,,,,MOBILE,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Foundations Alliance made all Zest components compliant with EAA standards out of the box, however, this does not guarantee full compliance. To achieve full compliance by June 2025, all CFAs will review their journeys and modify them as needed. 

Foundations Alliance has provided the following inputs to enable CFAs to minimize their efforts:",,,,,,,,,,53%,,,,20%,,

Summary

Mario Konschake and Nikita Gorshkov discussed the definition and rollout of the AI-native Product Development Lifecycle (PDLC), with Mario Konschake expressing concern that product management will become a bottleneck as engineering and UX speed up without proper support for providing fast and better context. Nikita Gorshkov introduced their concept of context-driven product management, detailing a custom automated system that curates a knowledge base of entities and relationships to improve generative AI output, but raised concerns about scaling this approach due to the lack of consolidated infrastructure and the "nightmare" of locating the correct version of institutional knowledge across disparate tools. The participants compared AI models, with Nikita Gorshkov preferring Gemini over Claude for general text and deep research, and they agreed that high-value AI capabilities for product managers lie in data discovery and analysis—specifically, using CLI tools to quickly analyze data and identify optimization opportunities.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Golden Path for AI-Native PDLC and Product Management Bottlenecks Mario Konschake is working with PEP to define and roll out the golden path for an AI-native Product Development Lifecycle (PDLC) (00:00:00). Mario Konschake explained that while there is a good candidate for software engineers (cloud code spec machine) and initial ideas for UX designers, product management is likely to become the bottleneck if engineering and UX speed up. The challenge lies in effectively supporting product managers in providing better and faster context to feed the development pipeline (00:01:56).

* Context-Driven Product Management and Knowledge Curation Nikita Gorshkov introduced their concept of context-driven product management, which has evolved since its initial version (00:03:19). They believe that product management is highly interconnected, requiring a lift-and-shift transition in working methods rather than peacemeal automation to gain the full benefits of AI. Nikita Gorshkov has developed a custom system using cloud code across two machines to maintain their own knowledge base of entities and relationships, which continuously learns and adds context to improve the output quality of generative AI tools (00:04:48).

* Challenges with Scaling Context Management and Infrastructure Mario Konschake noted that Nikita Gorshkov's approach of curating a context knowledge base seems to be a common pattern among AI-engaged product managers (00:06:06). Nikita Gorshkov raised concerns about scaling this, emphasizing the need to define future infrastructure and tools, ideally for one to two years, to avoid multiplying inefficiencies. A critical challenge is the lack of a consolidated source of truth, as people are using various tools, making learning non-transferable and knowledge management a persistent problem (00:07:29).

* Need for Centralized Documentation and Access Nikita Gorshkov highlighted the difficulty in identifying the correct version of documentation across systems like Google Docs, Confluence, and Jira, calling it a "nightmare" that is exacerbated by AI (00:09:07). They noted that institutional knowledge often resides in disparate places—Slack, random Google Docs, and code—and there is no clear indicator of the most current or accurate information (00:11:42). Mario Konschake agreed that the challenge lies in making knowledge accessi

to a little bit

Nikita Gorshkov: Sounds good. And I'll probably as a at some point I'll update the documents that I uh at

 

 

00:27:24

 

Mario Konschake: more.

Nikita Gorshkov: least like I believe in the document I wrote uh before I was building it based on notebook essentially for so that people don't get scared about CLI tools and cursor and stuff like that. Um, I'll probably be updating it to like to that next step of okay, how do you then you do all of the processes that uh you want to automate but through like clock codes for example and then share it at least with my PMs and whoever wants to read it. Um,

Mario Konschake: Yeah,

Nikita Gorshkov: and there's a notebook to ask

Mario Konschake: it would also be good feedback for me to understand like how uh how that will work

Nikita Gorshkov: questions.

Mario Konschake: with your PMS kind of CLI, right? is that is something that they are struggling with or they like first of all are they like curious eager to try it out uh and then is that something that is difficult for them or is that actually something that they can learn if they want to so that's I think it's a very important data point for me at this point as

Nikita Gorshkov: I don't think it's that complic.

Mario Konschake: well

Nikita Gorshkov: It's just you need to get used to it. And yeah.

Mario Konschake: yeah I'm a little bit burned because with starters we've made the assumption that like people can learn git

Nikita Gorshkov: Um,

Mario Konschake: analyst And that was not right. Uh so they they struggle some like some part some uh some of them

Nikita Gorshkov: really

Mario Konschake: struggled with that quite significantly. So that was a bit of a hurdle that we had.

Nikita Gorshkov: interesting.

Mario Konschake: Yeah. But also kit can get really

Nikita Gorshkov: Oh, yeah. It's It's I was What is it?

Mario Konschake: difficult.

Nikita Gorshkov: I had a very simple thing recently. I wanted to have a public repo be created from a folder within my private repo. And then I started reading about these sub subcomponents uh or uh within git and I was like why is this so f****** complicated guys? It's not the hardest thing that we're trying to do here. Yeah.

,

,Q1 capitalization audit

,Please follow the instructions below 

Step 1,Go to the tab of your respective alliance

Step 2,"Verify Column G - Finance/Portfolio Decision , for the final decision on Capitalisation of the KR."

,"If you want to challenge this decision, please change Column H - Do you want to challenge the decision? to Yes. Provide supporting commentary in Column I - Comment."

Step 3,Verify Column J - Check Questions to understand which question you need to answer:

,A - Provide evidence this KR results in the creation of assets in Column I - Comment.

,"B - Check column L - B. Does the KR result in economic benefit?

If the cell is highlighted with ‘Oops, there is no YP strategy provided for this KR’  you need to provide the YP/QAR strategy this KR is associated with on the OKR Management Tool - Column AP (Input - Tech Strategy) or you need to explain why this KR is associated with a strategy with an economic benefit.

If the cell is highlighted with ‘This KR is associated with KTLO but we believe it delivers benefit and results in the creation of assets. Please advise',  you need to help us map this KR to an economic benefit.

If the cell is highlighted with ‘KR not found on the OKR Tool’, please help us map days reported to another KR."

,"C - Change value in column M - C. Percentage of work reported in cap activities YTD that is actually capitalisable if the KR is set to not meet or canceled, if it is partially capitalisable, or if there is need to ensure teams are not reporting non-capitalisable activities.

You can also use this column to correct the number of capitalisable days if there were mistakes in the reporting during the previous months (see FAQ 3 for more details)."

,"If the column is “-” there are no open question to address and if there are more than one item (i.e. B, C) please address both questions."

,Plan,Pricing Principles at Launch

,All,Max box price should be $250 

,Fresh/Topper/Mixed,Max freezer fill is 1/3 a small NYC apt freezer

,Fresh,Aim to price lower than TFD but only if we can make PC2 margins and economics work

,All,Charge shipping separate to box price

,All,Shipping free in first order

,All,Price per day for trial is same as for regular box before discount

,All,Price per lb does not need to decrease as calories increase within same plan although it should go in that general direction

,All,"If we ship the same amount of product, the price should be the same"

,,

,Step,Description

,1: Import costs,All costs by plan imported into pricing file

,2: Benchmark,Competitors benchmarked to build up their pricing curves

,3: Scenarios,"High level pricing scenarios chosen per plan - final scenarios chosen:
- Fresh: Match TFD prices excluding shipping fee. Fresh is headline price to fix rest to
- Mixed: Should be 5-15% below Fresh depending on size and margins
- Topper: Should be 55-62.5% of Fresh price for 50% of product depending on size and margins
- Dry: Should be lowest price and price at 38% margins"

,4: Smooth pricing,Scenarios lead to choppy pricing. This was then smoothed

,5: Check PC2 / ROIs,PC2 and ROI reviewed to increase prices and improve margins where they were low

,6: Make steps,"If giving the same qty of product for 2 or more different SKUs, the prices were matched to create some stepped pricing"

,,

,,

,Type,Elements to Change in Price Test

,Architecture issue,Ensure same amount of food in box is always the same price

,Architecture issue,Review price per Lb curves i.e. price per LB should go down as calories increase

,Architecture issue,Review PC2 margins by calories within plan; and PC2 margins across calories

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Air Dried price to have lower entry price point to increase TAM

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Fresh price to be more competitive with Farmers Dog & Ollie

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Mixed price to sit in appropriate area between Fresh & Air Dried (being wary where Pantry Fresh would be)

,Architecture issue,"Lower price for larger dogs more than smaller dogs to encourage share of larger, higher ROI dogs"

management----------Dear Friends and HelloFresh Family,After 10 years and  

being called a dinosaur multiple times, my meteor has finally struck, and I  

will be leaving HelloFresh on December 19th. I ordered the meteor myself  

with this app, and will start my next chapter there. It's been a pleasure  

and honour to have worked with all of you.I'll be doing a "goodbye thing"  

next Tuesday, 16th, from 17-19h @R16 Partere.I'm not really huge on  

throwing parties, so it would be amazing if none of you could make  

it.However, there is a rumor that @Justin Zinck will be playing his  

clarinet. If &gt;1 person accepts the invite that will follow, there will  

be drinks and pizza.Cheers!

### EMAIL: Notes: “Connect on CA B2B Shopify Integration” Dec 15, 2025

Notes from “Connect on CA B2B Shopify Integration”



These notes have been sent to invited guests in your organization.



Open meeting notes



The content was auto-generated on December 15, 2025, 5:47 PM CET and may  

contain errors.





Summary



Elysa Viti initiated a discussion with Nikita Gorshkov about the Canadian  

B2B site, which requires Shopify as middleware because no current systems,  

except Katana, support the necessary B2B functionality out of the box; the  

site aims to automate small business employee orders (Factor only), which  

are currently manual and error-prone. Nikita Gorshkov emphasized that the  

success of B2B depends on a strong sales presence, and confirmed that zero  

people are currently allocated to B2B development, with expectations that a  

dedicated B2B team may be pushed for around June, leading Elysa Viti to  

estimate a Q3 launch for the Shopify integration. The strategy for the  

first half of the year involves manually testing streams like sports teams  

and gyms, and Elysa Viti suggested a separate team should handle B2B.





Suggested next steps





Elysa Viti will talk to Kieran and have him send over his business case so  

that she can tweak it for Canada.



Elysa Viti will forward all meeting notes over to Kevin and Cole for them  

to read up on and will keep Nikita Gorshkov posted on any questions.

Summary



Jenna O'Shea and Nikita Gorshkov discussed the immediate need to hire a  

mid-level designer for the Good Chop replacement position, with Jenna  

O'Shea preferring a mid-level role for long-term growth and Nikita Gorshkov  

emphasizing the candidate's need to be systematic. Regarding team  

management, Jenna O'Shea committed to being more hands-on and coaching Mega  

on stakeholder management, while they also decided to bundle design  

critiques for New Ventures and Shopping to promote knowledge transfer and  

suggested involving Nikita Gorshkov or Daniel in the hiring interviews.  

They also discussed Nikita Gorshkov's concern over the VMS Shopify store's  

templated design and "lack of ownership," and established the Factor Form  

strategy of integrating it into Factor if the Shopify store fails.





Suggested next steps





Jenna O'Shea will refine the New Brand's Jira board with sprint goals for  

designers by January 5th.



Jenna O'Shea will look for opportunities to open the position for 'good  

chop' sooner than January.



Nikita Gorshkov will ping Shay to connect with Jenna O'Shea for a demo to  

address UX issues for the factor forum subbrands.



Jenna O'Shea will put Yumi and Michael into a conversation to close the  

loop on the UX audit for factor form.



Jenna O'Shea will look into other rooms that she's supposed to be in.



The group will bundle the design critiques for new ventures and shopping  

together.

Summary



Mario Konschake and Nikita Gorshkov discussed the definition and rollout of  

the AI-native Product Development Lifecycle (PDLC), with Mario Konschake  

expressing concern that product management will become a bottleneck as  

engineering and UX speed up without proper support for providing fast and  

better context. Nikita Gorshkov introduced their concept of context-driven  

product management, detailing a custom automated system that curates a  

knowledge base of entities and relationships to improve generative AI  

output, but raised concerns about scaling this approach due to the lack of  

consolidated infrastructure and the "nightmare" of locating the correct  

version of institutional knowledge across disparate tools. The participants  

compared AI models, with Nikita Gorshkov preferring Gemini over Claude for  

general text and deep research, and they agreed that high-value AI  

capabilities for product managers lie in data discovery and  

analysis—specifically, using CLI tools to quickly analyze data and identify  

optimization opportunities.





Suggested next steps





Nikita Gorshkov will update the context-driven product management documents  

to include how to automate processes using cloud code and share it with PMs.



Mario Konschake will provide a document with requirements to security to  

set something up for Slack access.



The group will focus on engineers when it comes to actually building things  

for GenAI enablement.
