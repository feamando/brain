﻿Summary

 `

Enabling One-Time-Purchase (OTP) Capabilities for HF Groups Customers

	Summary: One-time-purchases enable HelloFresh to address customer needs for order flexibility, accessibility and concerns around subscription commitment, while enabling new ways to engage with existing, new and past customers across a variety of different use cases. This PRD aims to consolidate all known use cases for OTP in 2025 for HFG to define a path forward towards implementation.

	Created At: Jun 2, 2025

	Last Updated: Jul 7, 2025

	Editor(s): Deo Nathaniel – POC & Workflow

	Strategy: 

Seasonal boxes and one-off ordering capability 2024 & beyond proposalCross-Selling: Enable HF US customers to purchase single order(s) or recurring Factor meals through a “Market Integration” experienceNV-2025-01: Good Chop: Move Towards Ecommerce ExperienceTwo-Way Marketplace: (Dropshipping Expansion) Leadership Steerco

[HOW TO READ] This document is structured based on three big parts:

1. Summary & High-Level Overview Tab: These tabs serve as the central strategic hub. It outlines context and brief customer flows for each major use case (e.g., Good Chop, Seasonal Boxes) to give a quick understanding of the customer journey. It also synthesizes the Key Functionalities that need to be built across all these different use cases.

2. Individual Use Case Tabs (e.g., "Experience - Good Chop", "Experience - Seasonal Boxes"): Each of these dedicated tabs dives deep into a specific product or initiative. They break down the requirements by Milestones (e.g., MVP - Milestone 1), providing a clear roadmap from a use case perspective. The requirements are listed with User Stories and Acceptance Criteria format.

3. Dependency Tab: These tabs are used to identify and detail any specific work or information required from dependent Tribes and alliances.

1. Summary View of the Solution Proposed

This initiative aims to deliver a One-Time-Purchase (OTP) capability experience across HelloFresh Group brands. As of June 2025, across HelloFresh, several use cases had been identified—such as event-themed seasonal boxes, curated selections of specialized items (e.g., premium meat and seafood from Good Chop), items from a broader marketplace of third-party CPG brands, or ready-to-eat meals from sister brands like Factor—as standalone purchases, without the necessity of an active weekly meal kit subscription for that particular transaction (though OTP may also complement existing subscriptions).

The solution involves creating a seamless OTP user flow within each participating brand's digital platform. This includes clear product discovery for OTP-eligible items, transparent pricing and benefits, distinct OTP cart and checkout processes, appropriate order management for both new and existing customers (subscribed, paused, or cancelled), and downstream capabilities such as delivery management and data.

This foundational OTP capability will initially be piloted and rolled out for:

1. 2025 Initiative Rollouts: 

   1. Seasonal Boxes across HelloFresh (similar to the ANZ model but integrated).

   2. Good Chop offerings for both prospects and actives.

   3. Factor Form item based OTP purchase

2. 2026 Potential Targets:

   1. A 2-Way Marketplace on a selected HelloFresh brand (e.g., Green Chef US pilot) (potential PoC in Q4 2025) 

   2. Cross-selling of Factor meals (as OTP) (iteration on the “Opt-in” Market Integration Model)

   3. Further discovery migh

create add-on menus, call another menu, etc. if we don't have to.

[bv]What about the other way around? Are we expecting an ability to use existing benefits (through loyalty program) for the seasonal boxes?

[bw]What does it actually mean? Can you drop an example?

[bx]wondering the same - @nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com what did you have in mind?

[by]@mabu@hellofresh.com lmk if this is clearer now @nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com

[bz]What's "GST charge"?

[ca]Goods and Service Fee - NZ is set at 15% and is normally baked into products sold and AU is 10% but there are different rules to consider in order to remain compliant.

[cb]Assuming this would be a separate payment for customers who may also be ordering a regular subscription box? Similarly to how we charge HFM currently?

[cc]Payment details are never stored in the HF system, hence, it is not possible to prefill payment details. What we can try doing is "use existing payment" which would be a reference to a payment token.

[cd]What do we mean by this?

[ce]@nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com i assume you mean all the payment methods?

[cf]Does it mean that the data of OTP should be a part of analytics and should be identifiable as OTP?

[cg]essential to note that customers who have already purchased a seasonal box to be excluded from future CRM emails (i.e. if someone bought a Christmas box at full price, should not get a Black Friday discount email)

[ch]check if this breaks given there are not recipes essentially.

[ci]How will errors and NPS be measured?

[cj]check for Taxes

[ck]ask Daniel

[cl]Check with Benefits if they need subscription ID

[cn]Check on Invoice

[co]@mabu@hellofresh.com to check

[cp]Check if account, delivery and payment information can be prefilled

[cq]Ask Leo

[cr]I think we can simplify this to just talk about Katana

[cs]Split between FE data and BE data

[ct]@mabu@hellofresh.com to help check

[cu]Forecasting? Or will we rely on business case assumptions to plan volumes. Concern here is waste and ordering accuracy.

[cv]Will we have individual landing pages per seasonal offering or a page for "gifting" and a page for "seasonal boxes" which has all current boxes. (ref point https://www.myfoodbag.co.nz/shop/)

﻿The Pets Table App v1: Notifications-First MVP

Date: 2025-12-11 Authors: Prateek Jajoo (PM), Nikita Gorshkov (Dir Product) Status: Proposal





________________





1. Purpose

The Pets Table (TPT) faces a critical retention challenge: our Average Order Rate (AOR) lags behind competitors like Farmer’s Dog and Ollie, largely due to the lack of proactive, mobile-first customer engagement. This proposal outlines a low-cost, high-velocity strategy to deploy a TPT native mobile app. By leveraging a "webview-first" architecture (React Native shell + existing web flows), we can bypass expensive native development to deliver v0 (Web Parity) and v1 (Push Notifications). The core value prop isn't the app interface itself, but the notification channel it unlocks—driving customers back to the service for order management and upsells, projected to generate ~$1.5M in annualized incremental revenue.

2. Current State / Problem

"Out of sight, out of mind."





* Lagging AOR: TPT’s AOR is trailing key competitors who utilize native apps to maintain persistent screen real estate and habituation.

* Reactive vs. Proactive: Our current web-only experience relies on customers remembering to visit our site or opening emails (20-25% open rate). We lack a direct, proactive trigger to prompt timely order management.

* Friction: Logging into a mobile website is high-friction compared to biometric app login, discouraging frequent "snacking" interactions where add-on upsells occur.

3. Strategic Solution

Build "The Notification Vehicle" Instead of a costly, multi-quarter native app build, we propose a Webview-First Hybrid App.





* Strategy: Use the Client Platform’s new React Native infrastructure to wrap our existing mobile web experience.

* Philosophy: "The app is a notification delivery vehicle with a dashboard face. Everything else is a webview."

* Cost/Speed: Minimizes engineering effort by reusing 90% of existing web code. Focuses native development strictly on the "Unlock" features: Push Notifications and Biometric Login.

Core Experiences: v0 vs v1

Detailed scope sheet: Google Sheet Link

4. Business Impact

Hypothesis: Notifications drive frequency; frequency drives AOR and AOV.

Benchmarks (Weekly TPT Updates)

* Current AOR: Lagging behind key competitors (Farmer's Dog, Ollie).

* Competitor Engagement: Apps drive ~2x session frequency vs. mobile web.

* Push Open Rates: 5-10x higher than Email.

Projected Lift (Annualized)

	Mechanism

	Conservative Impact

	Revenue Impact

	Order Recovery

	"Last chance to edit" & "Card failure" pushes

	+5% AOR (App Users)

	~$1.1M

	Add-on Upsell

	"New treat" & "Box shipping soon" pushes

	+$2 AOV (App Users)

	~$400K

	Total

	



	



	~$1.5M

	



Assumptions: ~50k Active Subs, 30% App Adoption, $80 Base AOV.

5. Technical Strategy

We will leverage the new HelloFresh Client Platform capabilities to avoid building from scratch.





* Shell: React Native "Container" provided by Client Platform.

* Bridge: Two-way communication between Native Shell and Webview (allowing the web page to trigger native push permission prompts).

* Notifications: Integrated with ABBA (HelloFresh's notification infrastructure) and Braze/CRM for campaign management.

* Documentation: Infrastructure Architecture

6. Recommendations

1. Proceed with v0/v1 Strategy: Prioritize the notification unlock over native feature parity to maximize speed to value.

2. Leverage Client Platform: Utilize the existing React Native shell infrastructure to minimize overhead.

3. Launch & Learn: Ship v1 to validate the +5% AOR hypothesis before investing in further native features (v2).

Meeting records Transcript Recording 





Summary

Nikita Gorshkov and Prateek Jajoo discussed in-office meeting etiquette, agreeing that active participation should occur in private spaces while passive listening is acceptable at the desk, with Prateek Jajoo noting the current calm environment. They talked about the contextdriven product management document, which Nikita Gorshkov is planning with Tabby for a "quantum like jump" transition across teams, and the use of AI in product development, where Prateek Jajoo questioned the practicality of short experimentation windows due to customer volume concerns. Nikita Gorshkov plans to send a draft markdown document for the TPT app to Prateek Jajoo, Maria, Ahmed, and DA for estimation of V0 and V1 features, and clarified that the app initiative is a broad opportunity for Prateek Jajoo to onboard and understand domains alongside Maria, before focusing narrowly on specific projects.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* In-Office Meeting Etiquette Nikita Gorshkov and Prateek Jajoo briefly discussed the shift in acceptable in-office behavior, noting that in the past, taking meetings from one's desk was common. They agreed that current practice favors taking active participation meetings in private spaces like phone booths or meeting rooms, while passive listening is acceptable at the desk (00:00:00). Prateek Jajoo commented that the current environment feels "much more calmer" compared to pre-remote work times (00:01:14).

* Context-Driven Product Management Prateek Jajoo expressed interest in the contextdriven product management document and their excitement about the company moving toward a single context-driven document. Nikita Gorshkov mentioned that the document represents an ideal state and requires a "quantum like jump" rather than an incremental change for the whole team to adopt new principles from product management to engineering and design (00:02:17). Nikita Gorshkov also stated they are working with Tabby to plan the transition from current operations to this new vision, while building out tools in parallel (00:03:49).

* AI and Product Development Workflows Nikita Gorshkov shared information about the active clan genen AI channel and mentioned Alex is posting cloud code skills there, while they posted their PM automation system (PMO) which is a CLI-managed system that generated the pre-read and recaps for the current meeting (00:03:49). Prateek Jajoo liked the idea of using AI to determine what not to build through experimentation, but they questioned the practicality of short experimentation windows given customer volume concerns (00:05:07). Nikita Gorshkov admitted the difficulty of accelerating experimentation without synthetic traffic to replicate customers and mentioned that experimentation teams are resistant to the synthetic traffic idea (00:06:28).

* Shortening Discovery and Scoping Work Nikita Gorshkov emphasized that the goal of the new document and AI-driven processes is to significantly shorten investigation, documentation, scoping, and corner case management loops between product, design, and engineering. The intent is to leverage the vast amount of knowledge and data available to use AI for guidance in building roadmaps and investigations within CPT (00:07:33). Prateek Jajoo provided an example from their work on the registration page, highlighting how engineering contribution on page usage can provide pre-insights for AI guidance (00:08:45).

Nikita Gorshkov: I mean to be fair I I uh put you on the app because you have some extra capacity and it's a good thing to get into like a bunch of topics. I again same as I did with Beatatric and Dio. Um my ask to uh you and Maria like look onboard yourself. Don't worry about who takes which projects right now. Um but in January get back to me and and

Prateek Jajoo: All

Nikita Gorshkov: um yeah see like uh tell me tell me what to do.

Prateek Jajoo: right.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah.

Prateek Jajoo: All right. I asked only because in my one-on ones there are some people who are focusing on retention like Reena specifically and she was like, "Oh, where are you going to focus on?" So I was

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah, the the business is going to be pushing on on a clean definition.

Prateek Jajoo: like,

Nikita Gorshkov: I am fine like I want us to be more focused on specific projects uh because I need both of you to know each other's domains.

Prateek Jajoo: Got it.

Nikita Gorshkov: Like I can't have a situation where somebody is so focused on their domain that they can't help out if something happens

Prateek Jajoo: Right.

Nikita Gorshkov: on the other side.

Prateek Jajoo: Right. Okay. Cool. Got it. Um. Yeah. All right. This is this is good for now.

Nikita Gorshkov: Sure.

Prateek Jajoo: Um, yeah. Last thing I actually just if you have a have a sec I wanted to know like the hierarchy of product management as well. So uh here there is just senior product manager staff. What's the difference between principal and

Nikita Gorshkov: Uh principal is the next level essentially.

Prateek Jajoo: staff?

Nikita Gorshkov: So uh principal is director level uh IC. So we introduce principles as uh individual contributors that are um essentially Leo as a principle uh for example and he works on initiatives that are probably HelloFresh group generic for example cross-selling um like that's a major initiative across factor across hellofresh has bigger implications for uh the overall holofresh group and he's there to be the ninja that Kai cuts through all the red tape and uh pushes it through

﻿TAM Product: GenAI Ways of Working

 

TAM Product: Context-driven Product Management

	Summary: In 2025, thanks to the growing maturity of AI-based tools and products, the tech industry shifted from theoretical possibility to practical necessity of integrating AI into the daily processes of employees; HelloFresh as well has actively engaged into the exploration, deployment and integration of AI-based tools into the workplace across functions. This document aims to offer each product manager within TAM an easy step-by-step guide and inspiration on how your daily workflow can (and should) change through the integration of AI into every step of your daily workflow.

Problem

Delivery, efficiency expectations of leadership across HelloFresh generally and HelloTech in particular is being recalibrated to address the reality of AI-augmented staff capabilities; simply put - more and faster will be expected from every team member; that would stretch everyone if not mitigated by automation of intelligence-based repetitive work through AI integration.





Principles

The principles for the new AI-enabled product manager ways of working are grounded in the core principles of the New Model proposed by Assaf Ronenon 16.09.2025: 

1. Customer First: Every decision must begin with the customer and be anchored in satisfaction, retention, and lifetime value.

2. One Global System: Wherever possible, we will converge on unified tools, processes, and standards, eliminating duplication.

3. Speed and Agility: We will shorten decision cycles and empower leaders to experiment, learn, and scale quickly.

4. Clear Accountability: Each decision will have a single owner with the authority and responsibility to deliver outcomes.

5. MD-Integrated Organization: Managing Directors (MDs) own the P&L for each geography. Central functions must be responsive, enabling local experimentation while ensuring it aligns with globally defined systems.





Solution

The solution to the growing problem of increased expectations is not only the training and learning of effective use of individual tools by product managers; but ensuring all individual tools can be combined into a comprehensive process, ensuring that core components, assets, artefacts, tools, best practices are reused, expanded, sustained and followed, empowering individuals to achieve peak performance within this new age. It’s important to establish a set of core principles that should be guiding your work: 





1. You are responsible: whatever you do and whatever you create and submit - there is no substitution from your personal responsibility, your content, data, findings, priorities etc. that might be generated by an AI are, at the end of the day, your responsibility. 

2. AI isn’t the end-all-be-all: AI can do some things well, others brilliantly, a lot - not so well, it is up to you to balance where to use AI, there is (despite the hype) no (and cannot be) any substitute for your creativity, passion, quality and communication - you are you with AI or without. 

3. Product principles are here to stay: our product principles, ways of thinking about customers and their problems, data and KPIs, goals, solutions and strategies are still as relevant as they were before - they will enable you to benefit from the new capabiliti

... [TRUNCATED: 153367 chars omitted to save context] ...

u are reporting out on - ensure that all MAR/QARs and tactical reports are added into the NotebookLM for your team - share the NotebookLM with the team and stakeholders. 









Conclusion

This document is not aimed to be comprehensive or cover every single aspect of product management and the SDLC process, this is not only impossible, but also would assume a static reality where processes and approaches would not change. Especially right now - that is not the case. We are all in a world where a new technology is changing the way we all work, this technology is in its infancy and lacks strong product cases, integrations and has existing limitations; this situation is similar to where product management was when the iPhone 1/2 were released - nobody knew where and how the technologies would evolve, how this changes product management and the products that we build; the key right now is for you to remain curious, flexible and quick - don’t focus too much on existing products and tools, focus on building your comfort level when working with GenAI, understand the fundamental benefits and limitations of the technology, ideate, experiment and try new things, build confidence when working with it and know where it’s particularly strong. 





Finally, the most important piece to remember is that this is just a technology, it’s up to us, humans to define how we use it and be responsible for the outcomes that we are able to achieve with it. Even in the last couple of weeks as this document was being written, more and more it became apparent that human input, guidance and effort is not going anywhere to ensure that we solve problems for other humans.









Temp: Notes

Note 1: add context-driven/spec driven development concepts





[a]Do you also mean by this that basically with making sure that everything is contextually described, the product manager should also know exactly what's in production because they can see the context that was used to generate certain production features?

[b]Yes, I don't expect that the product manager has the complete understanding of every single feature, but, I am expecting that a product manager orchestrates that the context of their domain is clear, maintained and relevant.

1. tl;dr

Context-driven Product Management is a GenAI-forward framework that redefines the role of the product manager to be the central "owner of context." As generative AI automates many traditional product management tasks—such as writing first-draft user stories, summarizing research, and creating project plans—the product manager's primary responsibility shifts from creating detailed, static documentation to curating and maintaining a rich, dynamic, and machine-readable "Project Context Document." This document becomes the single source of truth that guides both human teams and AI agents, transforming the PM from a "specifier" into a "context curator."

This approach fundamentally champions a "build-first" culture. It moves away from lengthy, theoretical debates over specifications and prioritizes rapid, interactive prototyping. The core philosophy is that the fastest way to learn is by building and testing something tangible. By leveraging AI to drastically reduce the cost and time of creating prototypes, we can validate ideas with real users faster than ever before. The ultimate goal is to accelerate decision-making, significantly increase development velocity, and ensure that all stakeholders—product, design, engineering, and business—are perpetually aligned around a shared, continuously updated understanding of the customer problem and the proposed solution.

2. Introduction

Context-driven Product Management is a modern approach designed for a technology landscape where generative AI is an active, collaborative participant in the product development lifecycle. It represents a necessary evolution away from the traditional, documentation-heavy product management methodologies prevalent in many large tech companies. Those legacy processes, designed to mitigate the high cost of engineering by ensuring exhaustive upfront alignment, often led to long development cycles, documents that quickly became outdated, and a rigid adherence to plans that inadvertently stifled innovation and responsiveness. The classic PRD, while well-intentioned, frequently became a bottleneck, a static artifact in a dynamic environment.

In the past, product managers spent a significant amount of time creating detailed Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and specifications to minimize ambiguity before development began. This was a necessary, albeit slow, process. With the advent of powerful coding assistants that can generate boilerplate code and generative UI tools that can create high-fidelity mockups from a simple text prompt, the cost and time required to create initial prototypes and MVPs have drastically decreased. Context-driven Product Management leverages this fundamental economic shift. Instead of asking "What should we build?" based on lengthy documents, it asks, "What should we not choose to build?" by rapidly and inexpensively testing tangible, interactive prototypes with users. The focus moves from meticulously defining a solution in text to building confidence in a solution through early, continuous, and cost-effective v

... [TRUNCATED: 12153 chars omitted to save context] ...

fine Documentation Standards: Move from prose-heavy, static documents to structured, machine-readable Project Context Documents. This transition requires establishing clear, shared templates and providing guidance on how to structure information for both human and machine readability. This initial investment in creating robust templates will pay significant dividends in automation and clarity down the line.

* Promote Cross-functional Collaboration: The Project Context Document is a shared asset, not a siloed product artifact. Foster a culture where engineering, design, and product all contribute to and maintain this single source of truth. It breaks down silos by creating a single, shared workspace where all disciplines contribute their expertise in real-time. For example, engineers can update the implementation context directly, while designers link to the latest Figma files in the solution context.[a][b]

* Start Small and Iterate: Begin by applying this new workflow to a single, well-defined project or a pilot team. Treat the adoption of this process like a product itself. Learn from the experience, gather feedback from the team to refine the process and templates, and then scale the new way of working across the organization with proven best practices and internal champions.

[a]I have some skepticism here on how the context document will be used in practice 





it's already the purpose of daily standups, design reviews, dev huddles, etc. to pool expertise and give the latest piece of context without the need to be over-updating documents; the main issue I've seen is once the initiatives are over, then a lot of historical context gets lost/forgotten





so to me the purpose of the context doc is less on the daily collaboration but more for knowledge preservation + traceability





I could imagine a workflow where meeting transcriptions or slack threads are inserted into something like NotebookLM to automatically document key decisions/info, however if after every live meeting, engineers & designers are also expected to update the living document, then it creates more work overall if everybody else was part of that discussion already

[b]^ah I see this comment is basically addressed in the longer version of the doc 





when I first read this it read as more that the context doc would replace some of these live problem-solving/collaboration meetings

﻿Proposal & Tech Breakdown for the All-Brands Base App (Project ABBA)





Author(s): Daniel Arias

	Last Updated: May 5, 2025

	Status: Approved

	WBD: Unification of Mobile App Tech Real Estate to Support All Brands

	Purpose

Scope

With a technical approach for the future state of our mobile app architecture now aligned, the purpose of this document is to more granularly audit all consumer-facing experiences across all HelloFresh Group mobile apps in order to assess the engineering effort and technical strategy teams should account for in their 2025 Yearly Planning when looking to contribute to RTE brands such as Factor.





For each consumer-facing experience, we will estimate the engineering cost of:

1. Updating existing core native iOS/Android modules to support RTE and related functionality 

2. Migrate existing React Native experiences to the Shared Modules cross-platform solution and extend functionality





Accounting for these engineering estimates, market-specific business needs and long-term team ownership, this document looks to propose a technical solution (ie: Extend Native Modules: vs. React Native) for each TRE along with an overall project timeline and resource costing proposal to help drive 2025 Yearly Planning dependency conversations across teams.

Context

In Q4 2024, Foundations alliance is leading a project to bootstrap the “Shared Modules” repository, which enables teams across HelloTech to create cross-platform mobile experiences via React Native and import them into native mobile apps powered by the existing Swift and Kotlin codebases. Through this Shared Modules solution and infrastructure changes on existing native Swift and Kotlin platforms planned for H1 2025, an “All-brands” mobile app architecture [source] will be available which supports cross-platform development and enables teams to contribute to all HFG brands’ iOS and Android mobile apps.





  







Figure: Swift & Kotlin repos import modules from the “Shared Modules” repo that are then compiled by unified release pipelines to publish native iOS & Android apps across all brands in the organization





With the option of cross-platform mobile development now unlocked across teams in 2025, consumer-facing alliances are now looking to be informed on engineering resources and strategies they should allocate for in their 2025 roadmaps in order to support RTE brands. 

________________





Proposed Project Roadmap





The following project roadmap and timeline was derived from product team roadmaps and engineering effort estimations (see Effort Breakdown) from all impacted alliances.

Timeline

Milestones listed here are further described in the following Milestones section. This timeline might be adjusted as teams re-evaluate effort estimates and align on work stream start dates.

﻿2026 Strategy

FTEs: 8 devs (3 parental fill, 2 backfills) → Q2 7 FE devs (+ 1EM +2 POs) + [new] 2 FE devs + 1 BE 

Q1: 7 FE devs (Himash, Becca, Romi, Pame, Nvard, Chi, Madeeha)

Q2: +2 FE devs, +Bolo & Richa back (11 total FEs), 1 BE (TBD)

H2 2025 Reflection

In H2 2025, our product strategy was designed to address unrecovered Conversion Rates (CR) and declining Active Order Rates (AOR). For CR, we successfully launched the Reactivation page revamp and are on progress to launch the One Time Purchase experiment. On the AOR side, we drove Free Add-on take rates to over 90% consistently by closing gaps in the selection and persistence experience, and launched Charge at Checkout.

1. Reactivation Page Revamp. We launched a new, mobile-first reactivation page that reduces the page length by one third with improvements on information architecture and clearer call to action. Also, customers can now choose their free add-ons directly on the reactivation page, instead of after reactivating their accounts. These changes are foundational to run more free for life reactivation campaigns including turkeys on Thanksgiving  (+20% CR YoY). However, some critical features were de-prioritized such as the ability to change cadence and reschedule directly on the reactivation page. 

2. One-Time Purchases (OTP). The technical solution for OTP pivoted from the initial MVP hack to the proper solution due to a technical blocker from CRM as well as higher confidence in the new endpoint following HF rollouts. While this solution saves time in the long-term, the launch week is delayed (likely W2’2026 - TBC) due to additional time for another technical investigation and (unplanned) capacity constraints.

3. Closing Free Add-on Take Rate. By October we finally reached +90% free add-on take rate for both new and active users consistently. Persisting free add-ons (+40% active TR), developing the multi-add-on pop-up on funnel and reactivation (+5% TR), and migrating bundle offers to Wallet (4.2k customers). While it’s great that we finally closed down the Wallet take rate gap, a significant portion of Q3 engineering capacity was allocated, which was not originally accounted for in the H2 roadmap.

4. Charge at Checkout. By charging customers at checkout instead of at cut-off, we aim to improve empty conversions and acceptance rates, thereby positively impacting overall delivered orders.





Learnings: 

* Better resource planning for adhoc and technical initiatives needed: We only executed on 2 out of 5 key strategies referenced in the previous strategy document with projects such as the Pricing Value Experiment getting pushed to next year. When planning for H2 2025, we did not initially account for initiatives such as Subscribable free add ons, as well as more tactical initiatives like 2-week cadence or legal compliance initiatives in the (cancellation) funnel. Engineering capacity was also impacted around September-October due to personnel changes, including one transfer to TPT and two individuals taking parental leave. We also need to proactively account for resourcing technical initiatives such as endpoint deprecations and migrations.

* More space needed for iterations: there are initiatives such as Seamless and Search with clear next iterations, however instead of building these we focused on building new initiatives. This delays implementing these learnings and therefore realization of business value. Doing these next iterations with too much time in between can also lengthen development as the team has to re-learn the technical context for the next iter

[e]More directly in our control: Payment failures experience in Actives experience





refer back to separate Payments discussions eg payment re-try

[f]We had discussed the delivery date picker test. Similarly, testing faster shipping to increase CVR

[g]it's here below the line

[h]plan in OTP for Actives? small lift if it's just about re-directing to a Plans page and exposing an OTP option only?

[i]if the results are positive, we'd still need significant effort to make it scalable from the data perspective. right now we'd be driving in the blind and rely on adhoc analysis, which is fine for the test but not ok for scaling marketing. basically it fully kills bob attribution based on vouchers

bigger upside for %-based discounts

[l]Ideally we only take this up once funnel clean up is done

[m]currently placed below the line despite bigger BC than Raf because we have already seen some improvements this year (+19% in Gross RR YoY, +14% in Net RR YoY)

[n]is it due to the new page? do we have pre/post?

[o]i think this should be dependent on OTP leads results

[p]how come? I don't think the learnings from Leads test will necessarily transfer





It could work better because cancelled customers might have already experienced first-hand that subscription does not work 





We could even think about targeting specifically customers that have churned due to delivery frequency reasons

,A - Provide evidence this KR results in the creation of assets in Column I - Comment.

,"B - Check column L - B. Does the KR result in economic benefit?

If the cell is highlighted with ‘Oops, there is no YP strategy provided for this KR’  you need to provide the YP/QAR strategy this KR is associated with on the OKR Management Tool - Column AP (Input - Tech Strategy) or you need to explain why this KR is associated with a strategy with an economic benefit.

If the cell is highlighted with ‘This KR is associated with KTLO but we believe it delivers benefit and results in the creation of assets. Please advise',  you need to help us map this KR to an economic benefit.

If the cell is highlighted with ‘KR not found on the OKR Tool’, please help us map days reported to another KR."

,"C - Change value in column M - C. Percentage of work reported in cap activities YTD that is actually capitalisable if the KR is set to not meet or canceled, if it is partially capitalisable, or if there is need to ensure teams are not reporting non-capitalisable activities.

You can also use this column to correct the number of capitalisable days if there were mistakes in the reporting during the previous months (see FAQ 3 for more details)."

,"If the column is “-” there are no open question to address and if there are more than one item (i.e. B, C) please address both questions."

Summary



Nikita Gorshkov and Prateek Jajoo discussed in-office meeting etiquette,  

agreeing that active participation should occur in private spaces while  

passive listening is acceptable at the desk, with Prateek Jajoo noting the  

current calm environment. They talked about the *contextdriven product  

management* document, which Nikita Gorshkov is planning with Tabby for  

a "quantum like jump" transition across teams, and the use of AI in product  

development, where Prateek Jajoo questioned the practicality of short  

experimentation windows due to customer volume concerns. Nikita Gorshkov  

plans to send a draft markdown document for the TPT app to Prateek Jajoo,  

Maria, Ahmed, and DA for estimation of V0 and V1 features, and clarified  

that the app initiative is a broad opportunity for Prateek Jajoo to onboard  

and understand domains alongside Maria, before focusing narrowly on  

specific projects.





Suggested next steps





Prateek Jajoo will try to use the format of the context-driven product  

management document for the registration page document being worked on.



Nikita Gorshkov will edit the draft markdown document for the TPT app and  

send it to Prateek Jajoo, Maria, Ahmed, and DA for an estimation.



Nikita Gorshkov will review the V0 and V1 estimations for the TT app and  

ask DA to consolidate the estimation FT for those versions.

Hi Nikita,



 



For today’s product teams, when you roll out a new feature, how quickly can you tell if it’s actually driving the impact you intended ?



 



On 14th January, join Max Taylor, Senior Solutions Engineer at Mixpanel, as he walks through a practical approach to turning the user behavior data you already collect into clear, confident answers about every release. No extra setup. Just faster, sharper insights.



 



In this webinar, you’ll learn how to:



* Bring analytics and experimentation closer together to ship the right features

* Build a culture of validating decisions early instead of guessing late

*

Run smarter, faster experiments using the data already at your fingertips

This won’t be a high-level conversation. It’s a hands-on walkthrough designed to help product and data teams move from insight to validated impact with far less friction.
