﻿Meeting Series: Eva:Nikita 1:1

Cadence: Recurring

[2025-12-09] Upcoming Meeting

Eva:Nikita 1:1 Pre-Read

Type: 1on1





________________





1. Context/Why

This 1:1 provides an opportunity to follow up on key strategic initiatives and ongoing projects discussed in our previous meeting. We aim to review progress, address any emerging challenges, and align on next steps for critical areas such as the Tishi headcount conversion, Simon's involvement in development, and the VMS error metric report.





________________





2. Participant Notes

* Eva Martínez Romero: Leading strategic initiatives related to team bandwidth, development prioritization, and metric reporting to support business needs.

* Nikita Gorshkov: Providing strategic oversight, exploring funding avenues, and reviewing key reports to enable broader team support.





________________





3. Last Meeting Recap (December 4, 2025)

Our last 1:1 focused on two main strategic points:





* Tishi Headcount Conversion: Eva proposed a business case to convert Tishi's existing freelancer headcount to a permanent or temporary contract to address bandwidth needs for TPT and Good shop. Nikita supported this, suggesting funding could come from Good shop and TPT, and noted a PA might be a more cost-effective solution than a contractor.

   * Key Action: Nikita planned to discuss this with Yuri and Lauron to initiate the conversation, considering a temporary contract as a viable interim solution.

* Involving Simon in Road Mapping & Development: Eva outlined plans to involve Simon more closely in road mapping and development, including handing over the development of the perfect order rate. This was driven by recurrent prioritization issues in the shopping experience's lithium release impacting local markets.

   * Key Action: Eva also suggested, and both agreed, that Simon should create an extended report on the VMS error metric (to include Good shop and TPT data) for Nikita to review, aiming to bolster support for Alexia.





________________





4. Agenda Suggestions

1. Follow-up on Tishi Headcount Conversion: Update on discussions with Yuri and Lauron, and next steps.

2. Simon's Involvement: Progress on integrating Simon into road mapping and the handover of perfect order rate development.

3. VMS Error Metric Report: Review of Simon's extended report, initial findings, and next steps for leveraging it.

4. Strategic Alignment: Discuss any new priorities or emergent blockers related to current initiatives.

5. Open Discussion / AOB.





________________





5. Key Questions

* What was the outcome of your discussion with Yuri and Lauron regarding the Tishi headcount conversion? Are there any updates on potential funding from Good shop and TPT?

* What is the current status of Simon's involvement in road mapping, and has the handover of the perfect order rate development begun?

* Has Simon's extended report on the VMS error metric been completed or are there any initial insights? How can we best utilize this report to support Alexia?

* Are there any new critical issues or developments stemming from the shopping experience's lithium release that require attention?

* Are there any other topics or challenges you'd like to discuss that could impact our current strategic objectives?

﻿Summary

 `

Enabling One-Time-Purchase (OTP) Capabilities for HF Groups Customers

	Summary: One-time-purchases enable HelloFresh to address customer needs for order flexibility, accessibility and concerns around subscription commitment, while enabling new ways to engage with existing, new and past customers across a variety of different use cases. This PRD aims to consolidate all known use cases for OTP in 2025 for HFG to define a path forward towards implementation.

[HOW TO READ] This document is structured based on three big parts:

1. Summary & High-Level Overview Tab: These tabs serve as the central strategic hub. It outlines context and brief customer flows for each major use case (e.g., Good Chop, Seasonal Boxes) to give a quick understanding of the customer journey. It also synthesizes the Key Functionalities that need to be built across all these different use cases.

2. Individual Use Case Tabs (e.g., "Experience - Good Chop", "Experience - Seasonal Boxes"): Each of these dedicated tabs dives deep into a specific product or initiative. They break down the requirements by Milestones (e.g., MVP - Milestone 1), providing a clear roadmap from a use case perspective. The requirements are listed with User Stories and Acceptance Criteria format.

3. Dependency Tab: These tabs are used to identify and detail any specific work or information required from dependent Tribes and alliances.

1. Summary View of the Solution Proposed

This initiative aims to deliver a One-Time-Purchase (OTP) capability experience across HelloFresh Group brands. As of June 2025, across HelloFresh, several use cases had been identified—such as event-themed seasonal boxes, curated selections of specialized items (e.g., premium meat and seafood from Good Chop), items from a broader marketplace of third-party CPG brands, or ready-to-eat meals from sister brands like Factor—as standalone purchases, without the necessity of an active weekly meal kit subscription for that particular transaction (though OTP may also complement existing subscriptions).

The solution involves creating a seamless OTP user flow within each participating brand's digital platform. This includes clear product discovery for OTP-eligible items, transparent pricing and benefits, distinct OTP cart[a] and checkout processes, appropriate order management for both new and existing customers (subscribed, paused, or cancelled), and downstream capabilities such as delivery management and data.

This foundational OTP capability will initially be piloted and rolled out for:

1. 2025 Initiative Rollouts: 

   1. Seasonal Boxes across HelloFresh (similar to the ANZ model but integrated).

   2. Good Chop offerings for both prospects and actives.

   3. Factor Form item based OTP purchase

2. 2026 Potential Targets:

   1. A 2-Way Marketplace on a selected HelloFresh brand (e.g., Green Chef US pilot) (potential PoC in Q4 2025)

Meeting records Transcript Recording 





Summary

Prateek Jajoo experienced a Confluence page access issue, which was resolved by Nikita Gorshkov granting access to anonymous users, who also clarified the meeting's purpose is for Prateek Jajoo’s personal development, unblocking, and issue escalation, asking them to manage ETAs for the login page and app documentation. Prateek Jajoo updated on prioritizing login page features like text box visibility and language enhancement for conversion before Katrina's absence, seeking reviews from Nikita Gorshkov and Laura Doas this week, and also discussed deprioritizing social logins while raising concerns about the lack of recipe selection transparency on the checkout page, which Nikita Gorshkov agreed to test if inexpensive. Additionally, Prateek Jajoo sought clarity on the design review process with Laura Doas, with Nikita Gorshkov advising to consult Maria about the TPT experience preview or set up a separate small design review.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Access to Confluence Page Prateek Jajoo reported difficulty accessing the new tribe in Slide page on Confluence despite receiving an email confirming access (00:00:00). Nikita Gorshkov resolved the issue by granting access to anonymous users, which Prateek Jajoo found to be a "big relief" (00:01:13).

* Personal Development and Project Management Nikita Gorshkov clarified that the purpose of their standing meeting is to discuss Prateek Jajoo’s personal development, unblock them, and escalate issues. They requested Prateek Jajoo to manage expectations regarding the ETA for work on the login page and the app documentation and plan (00:03:09).

* Login Page Feature Prioritization and Review Prateek Jajoo provided an update on the login page work, focusing on frontloaded efforts due to Katrina's upcoming absence, which involved creating and prioritizing a list of features to improve conversion rates (00:04:25). The primary features prioritized for one sprint's work include improving the text box's visibility and making it more action-oriented, as well as enhancing the language's intent with emotional appeal and social proof (00:05:52). Prateek Jajoo intends to secure reviews from Nikita Gorshkov and Laura Doas this week to finalize designs before Katrina's departure, aiming for development in the second sprint (00:04:25).

* Deprioritization of Social Login and Recipe Transparency Prateek Jajoo mentioned the deprioritization of social logins, citing data from other brands and the older demographic of their customer base as factors. They are, however, deep-diving into more data and plan to detail the rationale in a one-pager. Additionally, Prateek Jajoo raised a concern about the lack of recipe selection display on the checkout or payment page, proposing that adding transparency might improve completion rates (00:09:19). Nikita Gorshkov suggested the lack of display may have been due to complexity, but agreed that testing the feature, if inexpensive, would be worthwhile, as displaying the recipes could build additional confidence for customers at the point of highest commitment (00:10:29) (00:13:43).

* Process for Design Review Prateek Jajoo sought clarity on the process for reviewing designs with the broader team, specifically requesting feedback from Laura Doas while Katrina is still available. Nikita Gorshkov advised checking with Maria about the TPT experience preview or setting up an independent small design re

... [TRUNCATED: 12704 chars omitted to save context] ...

e customer or reduces the transparency or creates doubt kind of can lead the customer to uh not make the purchase but also we don't want to overload the customer as well. So that was a bit surprising but again I just wanted to understand the reasoning of it. So if you're right uh if it's in inexpensive maybe we can try to see if we can do right.

Nikita Gorshkov: I agree and honestly like you can display it in the sidebar and it's a feature that doesn't necessarily distract but essentially like I know the distraction argument but in this case I don't think it's necessarily applicable.

 

 

00:15:08

 

Prateek Jajoo: I think some things are expected and that expectation not meeting could lead to drop off.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah, exactly.

Prateek Jajoo: Right. Uh okay cool. Uh I'll look into it uh get more transparent in into that argument. And uh the my question is look Katrina is going I think we are already to something and I want to make sure that uh she's able to provide us her time uh this week before going but I want

Nikita Gorshkov: H. Yep.

Prateek Jajoo: to uh understand the process of how do we review or bring it to the broader team right I want uh Laura Das to give us the feedback so that any feedback could be actioned on before she goes so that we can we are good to go. Even if she doesn't have the time, we'll know what need what's the feedback.

Nikita Gorshkov: So we should be having uh so check with Maria regarding the TPT uh experience preview. Else you can set it up with Laurand Dovas etc. just on your own uh for a small design review. In some cases like in this case like it might be sufficient to have this async. So basically provide them give a justification and get their feedback that way. But if you want to do it live feel free. You also need to establish those relationships. So it's worth it uh doing it live.

Prateek Jajoo: Perfect. I'm I'm I'm anyway meeting with Doas today.

Nikita Gorshkov: Nice.

Prateek Jajoo: So I'll get some feedback and then share it with the based on uh his viewpoint either if it's very concrete and we are all aligned. Uh I can just put 30 minutes to just socialize it. It would be my first so it would be great. So yeah. Cool. Awesome.

Summary

Nikita Gorshkov and Beatrice Dimarucut discussed "charge at checkout" refunds, noting that a week is too long for the process and that tracking refunded customers separately may be necessary, and they agreed to consult with Kag to clarify how refunds and cancellations are individually tracked in the AL system for paid orders. Nikita Gorshkov is introducing Beatrice Dimarucut to the Spur founders, whose competitive analysis tool addresses tracking and comparing flows to an ideal state, and they have financial approval to procure them as a supplier. Furthermore, Nikita Gorshkov is opening a CS5 role for Beatrice Dimarucut to mentor, providing career development and shoring up work with Yuri following Dio's departure, and assured Beatrice Dimarucut that potential resistance from Annie would be minimal due to the defined headcount structure and involvement of key people like John, Yuri, Seb, Alex, DA, and external folks from payments and customer care.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Discussion on Charge at Checkout Refunds Nikita Gorshkov and Beatrice Dimarucut discussed the issue with refunds for customers who use "charge at checkout." Nikita Gorshkov expressed concern that a week is too long for a refund process (00:01:00), and they explored the possibility of tracking customers who ask for refunds separately on their end (00:01:56). Beatrice Dimarucut confirmed that refunds work via AL (a system) for charged at checkout customers, but the problem arises when non-charged at checkout customers call to cancel their first box before the cut-off (00:03:25).

* Clarification of Refund and Cancellation Process in AL Nikita Gorshkov questioned whether a paid order via charge at checkout should ever be in the status "canceled" in AL. Beatrice Dimarucut thought it should be possible to cancel a paid box if it is not yet in shipping status, but they were unsure if the status would be "canceled and refunded" (00:07:54). They agreed that they need to ask Kag if refunds and cancellations are tracked individually (00:11:48), and they discussed the need for a mechanism to check for paid "charge at checkout" orders that are merely in the "canceled" status to ensure a refund is processed and avoid customer complaints (00:09:54).

* Spur Call and Competitive Analysis Tool Nikita Gorshkov explained that the "spur call" is to introduce Beatrice Dimarucut to the Spur founders, who have developed a new agent for competitive analysis. This new tool, developed after they proposed the use case to Spur, addresses how to track and compare different flows to an ideal state, which was a challenge Nikita Gorshkov faced with a previous personal project (00:13:56). The tool is an external service for internal workflows, and the team has received financial approval to procure them as a supplier (00:15:18).

* Career Development and Team Structure Beatrice Dimarucut mentioned that they haven't had a career development call recently, and Nikita Gorshkov recalled giving feedback on areas for them to work on, specifically how to shore up work with Yuri in a more long-term thinking perspective, especially with Dio leaving (00:16:33). Nikita Gorshkov confirmed that adding headcount is proceeding with alignment across multiple VPs. They plan to open a CS5 role that Beatrice Dimarucut will start mentoring, which will establish a "brilliant setup" (00:17:37).

* Discussing Potential Resistance from Annie Bea

going to be a uh uh CS5

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: live uh so that you also start mentoring more junior members of the team uh going forward.

 

 

00:18:52

 

Beatrice Dimarucut: Okay, sounds good.

Nikita Gorshkov: And then we have a brilliant setup.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Okay, nice. Um, do you think like I mean I don't have like any touch points with Annie or so like do you think she might be like difficult to Okay.

Nikita Gorshkov: It shouldn't be the case. Um, I mean it's worthwhile. Is it worthwhile?

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah. You tell me. I don't know as in like I mean I don't have any natural touch points with her so I just don't know if there's going to be any like resistance or so like if in the end I guess her

Nikita Gorshkov: Sorry, it say no.

Beatrice Dimarucut: approval is needed. I don't know.

Nikita Gorshkov: No. Uh look, at the end of the day, you're going to have uh John, myself, Yuri, Seb, uh Alex, uh DA, and we'll take a bunch of uh folks uh external that you've been interacting with. So, off of payments, uh um customer care here, we'll think about who else to bring onto the board uh uh onto this discussion.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah.

 

 

00:20:04

 

Beatrice Dimarucut: Okay. Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: It's really yeah should be fine.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah. That's okay. Mhm. All right. Sounds good. Cool. Then

Nikita Gorshkov: Like I'm not going to say no but I agree that there are no natural touch points. Moreover, you're working on the main objective uh document that's reporting into Dominic outside of like her structure. Your headcounts is also defined outside of her structure. Um, well, because it's New Ventures, it it's tough to find like an artificial, "Oh, Annie, let's go for a coffee."

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: Like, sure, but also I I don't think it's like if we figure out what if there's a big dependency, but for Q1, we don't have any big dependencies, honestly.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah. Yeah, I mean intentionally so as well I think. But um no, I mean I don't need to like force it. It's more just so like I don't know if if we think it's going to be a risk that it might be a blocker then Yeah. Okay. Okay. Cool.

💡 Meeting Notes [To be filled after the Review Meeting by the YP Document Owner and sent out via email to attendees. This section does not impact the maximum number of pages]

Review Meeting Date: Oct 16, 2025

Attendees: Jama MusseCho HwangAnnie MeininghausCho HwangHolger HammelDominik RichterEd BoyesAssaf RonenLaurent GuillemainSeb TronFabien SimonAdriana VillarBrian Leung





Key Takeaways, Decisions, and Next Steps:

1. Alignment needed with Adam Park on plan for Factor Programs, as it fell below the line for Q4 and Q1. Does this need to be reprioritized? Done, we have agreed to keep momentum on physical product as well as planning ahead of Q2 development relaunch 

2. Factor Tech prioritization list created by Adam Park needs to be reviewed against the backlog of the MD squad. Done, we have reviewed the incremental asks, and have pulled them into Ed squad prioritization, and flagged items already in YP’s 

3. Lack of analytics resourcing was highlighted as risk for New Ventures, Annie and Jama to take away and come back with Analytics resourcing plans for New Ventures We have added 1 incremental PA resource to the New Ventures domain space, and will be looking to move additional temporary capacity to reduce the outstanding backlog 

4. Factor Form should better connect their products to customers  goals to create a “personalized performance stack”. Jama to connect with Adam Park on this plan We have added this for exploration in Q3 plan 

5. An aligned strategy should be created on how Loyalty should work for the New Ventures, and should this connect to the New Loyalty strategy set to launch in Q2-Q3 We will be looking to leverage the New Loyalty program when it launches, so we have therefore moved loyalty for Pets Table back by 1 quarter into Q3   

6. Cross Selling for other brands outside of HelloFresh and Factor is below the line for 2026 to be revisited for 2027 planning









Changes requested to the Yearly Plan during Draft Reviews. Please update before submission for final YP approval:  

* Move Loyalty on Pets Table by 1 quarter to Q3 to leverage  New Loyalty program launch 

* App Launch for Pets Table to become contingent on results of Elysium and ABBA app launches (both financial and performance KPIs)













	I. Organizational Overview

Mission and Focus areas

[h]what would you like to see here but aren't right now? @lgui@thepetstable.com

_Assigned to lgui@thepetstable.com_

[i]1. Multipet checkout improvements (direct impact on improving AOR)

2. Increasing add on % of net revenue through add on subscribe & save, product marketing & UX (goal to increase add ons as a % of NR from 1% to 5% in 2026)

3. Other CVR initiatives e.g. testing other qus in the quiz (previous pet food, neutered/spayed, etc), personalised value reinforcing stats, etc

4. RAF initiatives on Tiered credit based on loyalty; RAF social proof & CVR improvements -> one of our goals for 2026 is to step change RAF





The team have this long list of initiatives and we will prioritise them through our quarterly planning.





The key thing is that we are resourced to tackle the vast majority of these and we've aligned on the resourcing for that. I can share with you in our call on Tuesday

[j]Aligned with Laurent on this, we have a good understanding of the overall capacity needs with the team based on the available initiative roadmap; this particular table/format was not aimed to be exhaustive of all of the work we aim to deliver in 2026.

one stream that's not present in here but we have as part of objectives and currently actively exploring is modernized CX leveraging AI: we are now looking at a few solutions that would augment CC, support sales funnel with live Q&A as well as retention flow (i.e. replace cancellation flow with native chat experience and go off the cancellation reason - solution) - this would need team support (data ingestion, PM steering, etc)

### DOC: GoC H1 2026 Product Prioritization - WIP

﻿2026 Strategy

FTEs: 8 devs (3 parental fill, 2 backfills) → Q2 7 FE devs (+ 1EM +2 POs) + [new] 2 FE devs + 1 BE 

Q1: 7 FE devs (Himash, Becca, Romi, Pame, Nvard, Chi, Madeeha)

Q2: +2 FE devs, Bolo & Richa back (11 total FEs), 1 BE (TBD)

H2 2025 Reflection

In H2 2025, our product strategy was designed to address unrecovered Conversion Rates (CR) and declining Active Order Rates (AOR). For CR, we successfully launched the Reactivation page revamp and are on progress to launch the One Time Purchase experiment. On the AOR side, we drove Free Add-on take rates to over 90% consistently by closing gaps in the selection and persistence experience, and launched Charge at Checkout.

1. Reactivation Page Revamp. We launched a new, mobile-first reactivation page that reduces the page length by one third with improvements on information architecture and clearer call to action. Also, customers can now choose their free add-ons directly on the reactivation page, instead of after reactivating their accounts. These changes are foundational to run more free for life reactivation campaigns including turkeys on Thanksgiving  (+20% CR YoY). However, some critical features were de-prioritized such as the ability to change cadence and reschedule directly on the reactivation page. 

2. One-Time Purchases (OTP). The technical solution for OTP pivoted from the initial MVP hack to the proper solution due to a technical blocker from CRM as well as higher confidence in the new endpoint following HF rollouts. While this solution saves time in the long-term, the launch week is delayed (likely W2’2026 - TBC) due to additional time for another technical investigation and (unplanned) capacity constraints.

3. Closing Free Add-on Take Rate. By October we finally reached +90% free add-on take rate for both new and active users consistently. Persisting free add-ons (+40% active TR), developing the multi-add-on pop-up on funnel and reactivation (+5% TR), and migrating bundle offers to Wallet (4.2k customers). While it’s great that we finally closed down the Wallet take rate gap, a significant portion of Q3 engineering capacity was allocated, which was not originally accounted for in the H2 roadmap.

4. Charge at Checkout. By charging customers at checkout instead of at cut-off, we aim to improve empty conversions and acceptance rates, thereby positively impacting overall delivered orders.





Learnings: 

* Better resource planning for adhoc and technical initiatives needed: We only executed on 2 out of 5 key strategies referenced in the previous strategy document with projects such as the Pricing Value Experiment getting pushed to next year. When planning for H2 2025, we did not initially account for initiatives such as Subscribable free add ons, as well as more tactical initiatives like 2-week cadence or legal compliance initiatives in the (cancellation) funnel. Engineering capacity was also impacted around September-October due to personnel changes, including one transfer to TPT and two individuals taking parental leave. We also need to proactively account for resourcing technical initiatives such as endpoint deprecations and migrations.

* More space needed for iterations: there are initiatives such as Seamless and Search with clear next iterations, however instead of building these we focused on building new initiatives. This delays implementing these learnings and therefore realization of business value. Doing these next iterations with too much time in between can also lengthen development as the team has to re-learn the technical context for the next itera

It could work better because cancelled customers might have already experienced first-hand that subscription does not work

Accessibility-2025 Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Accessibility-2025 Program,,,,,,,,,,Recent action Items,,,,,,

,Welcome! The Accessibility-2025 Program will enable HelloFresh Group to complete HelloTech Objective #4 and comply with the modern level of accessibility for our customers driven by The European Accessibility Act (EAA). The program has two goals:,,,,,,,,,,🔄,"Resolve 90% of the P1 issues identified through Cypress that break 11 WCAG rules and manual audits in WEB.
Deadline: December 31st.",,,,,

,1,"Reduce the number of ""important"" Accessibility issues in HelloFresh, GreenChef, and Factor by 90% in WEB experiences by 28 June 2025, and in Mobile experiences by 31 Dec 2025.",,,,,,,,,🔄,"Resolve 90% of the P0 issues identified through Cypress that break 4 WCAG rules and manual audits in REACT NATIVE.
Deadline: December 31st.",,,,,

,2,Establish accessibility standards to support future HelloTech product development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Current P90 compliance,,,,,,source

,Background,,,,,,,,,,WEB,,,,MOBILE,,

,"The European Accessibility Act (EAA), which mandates that websites and mobile applications comply with WCAG 2.2 Level AA accessibility standards, will come into effect on June 28, 2025. The directive applies to all businesses in the EU, including HelloFresh. Non-compliance can result in penalties such as fines (ranging from 500–500k€) or, in some countries like Ireland, even prison sentences. Companies may also face legal action from disability advocacy groups.",,,,,,,,,,33%,,,,15%,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Remediating the risk of fines requires a company-wide collaboration, which is the background of launching this program. Apart from avoiding fines, improved Accessibility in our interfaces also gives us access to new potential customers (with disposable income) who previously may not have considered our product because they functionally were prevented from doing so. There is no calculated business case for the Group yet, but we plan to dig deeper into the opportunity in H2. The program will be driven by Foundations Alliance and involve all CFAs teams owning Front End TRE in mobile or web.",,,,,,,,,,2025 compliance target,,,,,,source

,,,,,,,,,,,WEB,,,,MOBILE,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Foundations Alliance made all Zest components compliant with EAA standards out of the box, however, this does not guarantee full compliance. To achieve full compliance by June 2025, all CFAs will review their journeys and modify them as needed. 

Foundations Alliance has provided the following inputs to enable CFAs to minimize their efforts:",,,,,,,,,,53%,,,,20%,,

, ☑️,"Improved Zest Design System components for iOS, Android, Web, and React Native platforms to have complete compliance with accessibility guidelines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,Created and maintain solution-oriented Accessibility Guidelines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,"Align, Define and Report upon an Accessibility Compliance Score.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,Automated the identification of code-driven accessibility issues based on the automated end-to-end UI Tests,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,"Provided results of a 3rd-party Accessibility Audit for HelloFresh, GreenChef, and Factor brands across web and mobile platforms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

﻿Final YP





💡 Meeting Notes [To be filled after the Review Meeting by the YP Document Owner and sent out via email to attendees. This section does not impact the maximum number of pages]

Review Meeting Date: Oct 16, 2025

Attendees: Ed Boyes Assaf Ronen Dominik Richter Holger Hammel,Cho HwangAnnie MeininghausDina MehrezThomas GrieselFabien SimonMarlene RosnerBrian LeungAdriana VillarEvan WeintraubJama Musse





Key Takeaways, Decisions, and Next Steps:

1. Clarify how menu expansion plans, personalization roll outs  and app features come together: 

   * Elysium (new store and homepage in the app) roll out is fast followed by new app feature which benefits users  irrespective of menu ranking roll out (most notably merchandising widgets for marketing,  recommendation widgets,bringing search to apps, populating “most popular, “trending” widgets - details)

   * Menu ranking roll out: At the same time there is a roll out plan for menu ranking models which prioritizes P500 readiness in Q4/Q1 as well as Penguin for Factor US. Food Systems is trying to expedite Penguin for INTL if possible, prioritized after p500. Fall back is to launch Penguin Harp personalization to INTL markets expanding in Q1.  Other RTE markets in H2.

2. Share prioritization framework  for Project 5M. The prioritization is heavily influenced by successful companies and features observed (direct or indirect competitors) as well as through an internal workshop. This revealed a consistent and significant behavioral gap: Users enthusiastically save recipes (often from social media) but rarely act on them. This indicates a high desire for inspiration but a significant friction point in execution. This led to the prioritization of the recipe bridge in Q4/Q1. If requested we can  walk through the detailed methodology.

3. Decouple forecasting from personalization models. Food Systems to define technical interfaces enabling independent iteration. Once validated, assess org impact in Q1–Q2.

4. Reconcile marketing RAF plan with tech YP.  We have addressed the  gap between Marketing and Consumer growth targets. Share squad will focus on strengthening the Refer-a-Friend (RAF) program while building new in-product sharing loops to drive organic growth. prioritizing foundational fixes — improving data visibility, customer experience, and operational agility — to make the RAF program self-sufficient and easier to optimize without tech dependencies. 

5. Variable pricing is an urgently requested feature by markets. We added it  to the Market Innovation squad backlog H2. Will define long-term ownership before initiation as we are currently moving pricing ownership to growth MA. 





Changes requested to the Yearly Plan during Draft Reviews. Please update before submission for final YP approval:  

* Should we invest into an AOV-focused squad? Yes we will self fund a new AOV driven squad in Q2 with a dedicated KPI. Focus in Q1  is first to roll out the new personalized core journey including widgets and then layer in more upselling components. 

* Loyalty strategy across markets: We decided to reserve a small team to  maintain and improve the existing  program while implementing  the new vendor based loyalty program to launch first in  the US . See Loyalty Strategy SMT Shareout.

* Double check if all Factor requirements are in the plan: All documents were collected and integrated into the Market Innovation backlog. To be signed off by Ed Boyes

Problem Statement

Social media has become a primary hub for culinary inspiration, where people turn to influencers to discover new recipes. While Followers struggle to find the necessary ingredients and an easy way to re-cook them, Influencers look for new revenue streams to be more independent from the heavily controlled platforms and find new ways to expand their reach and engage with their audiences authentically and organically via food.





Opportunity:

Hellofresh sees a huge opportunity to serve both: by transforming influencers' inspiration (recipe) into a shoppable, cookable meal kit for the consumers. 

By bridging the gap as the Expert in operation, warehouses and logistics, we provide customers a way to enjoy these recipes easily and the influencer to serve their followers and create a new revenue stream. The social commerce market is growing rapidly and can represent a huge opportunity for us to attract new customers.





Why now:

We see the urgency to act now, because influencers are already trying to solve this problem with links to ingredient orders  via Instacart or Pinterest partners with Instacart to enable 1-click grocery list generation from saved pins. But today, shoppable content on social media within the food category is often limited to individual food items as opposed to a holistic offering where the ingredients for entire recipes and direct delivery can be purchased. 





The Core Ask 

WBD: Influencer Marketplace

Explore desired and viable vision for a curated recipe creator marketplace (1. influencer, 2. Aggregators) with the option of an  instant purchase as a meal kit ‘fulfilled by HelloFresh’.





Long-term Vision (Later) 

Transform HelloFresh into the “Spotify for food”  a platform where any creator can share a recipe that HelloFresh fulfills.

Prototype Test

Prototype for evaluating the concept













[a]I think in the script we can keep the intro we are already using and maybe shorten the section about them and their content. I think it would be important to get some context still on their content and background but maybe we just trim that down from what we had before so it doesn't take up as much time.

[b]Do we want to continue to cover anything from the previous sessions? I think getting some more data on how they follow trends might be helpful and I do want to ask about their pricing expectations around the 'set your own price' idea. I know they said they don't need data on it, but I think it would still be helpful to gather some since we won't have many opportunities to speak with influencers.

[c]@katheryn.eckles@hellofresh.com i would leave this up to you

[d]@katheryn.eckles@hellofresh.com this could be also part of the intro to answer some questions beforehand

[e]@katheryn.eckles@hellofresh.com this as well for the beginning

[f]@katheryn.eckles@hellofresh.com this as well

[g]@katheryn.eckles@hellofresh.com Do we need this?

[h]@katheryn.eckles@hellofresh.com would you rather do a feature cart sorting?

[i]would we need to create a hellofresh shop with all influencer recipes to shop and the influencer itself advertise it?

	  Cross Brands Account Switching - User Stories & Notes

	Overview





The Mealkit Expansion and Support Squad is currently building the crossbrands passwordless signup experience for HelloFresh US customers which checkout through the Factor US signup funnel [RFC]. This experience is planned to extend for active Hellofresh US customers through an entry point. [Figma]





  



Opt in banner experience for Active HF US customers





For Hellofresh US customers engaging with this flow, they will be following the same experience as the crossbrands passwordless signup experience using a magic link. Before engaging with the magic link, the users will be redirected to the new Factor signup funnel where they would initially select meals, which will be later patched when subscription is created. The timeline for this initiative is late Q3 2024.



  



Proposed User Flow





  

[a][b]

Precheckout meal selection for Factor US





Technical Solution





Note: [c][d]

1. In case the Hellofresh US customer is already a deactivated Factor US Customer, they should be routed to the Reactivations page.

2. In case the Hellofresh US customer is already logged in on Factor US, they should be routed to the Factor My Deliveries page.

The solution can be implemented in multiple domains depending on the requirements and timelines:

1. Backend-based Solution (Not recommended)[e][f]

There are two options available:

   1. Customer Recurring Selection Service (CRS) 

Squad:  #nv-backend (NVB)  PoC (Ahmed WagdiMorteza Pourkazemi)

The NVB team implemented changes for the precheckout meal selection functionality supporting Goodchop brand earlier this year (H1 2024). The functionality in itself can be used for all brands for precheckout meal selection. The caveat here is that Goodchop uses static menu every week and therefore the then solution built was enmeshed with precheckout meal selection and recurring selection service, essentially preserving users precheckout meal selection to the current as well as future weeks of their subscription.

The details of the initiatives can be found here: 

      1. Epic

      2. RFC ticket

                Pros:

                The solution is readily available with an existing brand and can be extended for Factor US customers[g][h][i]

                

Cons:

The solution built by NVB team is temporary with the above mentioned caveat and will be sunsetted in favor of yearly planning agreement with Cart Foundation Squad (#​​squad-cart-foundation)



Effort Estimate: ~1 sprint 1 FTE (including Progress Bar changes)

Note: This is a very rough guesstimate as NVB effort estimate is unknown yet. We can assume medium for now.  I will check with their team (Our guess is that until NVB can prioritize and finish the work, option 1b will be already available, so this temporary solution will become obsolete)

So, we choose the higher end of the estimation

                

      2. Cart Foundation Squad

Squad: #​​squad-cart-foundation PoC (Tales PaduaLaura Mneimneh)

The Cart foundation squad had agreed as a part of yearly planning to provide an endpoint for the New Ventures team that would replace the requirement of CRS and could be extended to multiple brands. 

The details of the agreement can be found here:

         1. YP agreement (Row 37/ FOO-T-35)

Pros:

Use a solution bu

... [TRUNCATED: 4079 chars omitted to save context] ...

only choose from public menu

[j]are there any workarounds for this endpoint, or are we blocked until it becomes available?

[k]Yes, we are blocked until this endpoint becomes available or CRS is updated to handle multiple countries and CRS is disintegrated as precehckout meal selection and recurring meal selection for Goodchop

[l]Does the current solution account for the filterDeliveryMoments/firstDeliveryDate RCS setting that is commonly used on Factor US for demand steering?

[m]We haven't accounted for this. Do you foresee any potential issues?

[n]Since new Factor users can have their first order in a number of future weeks, you need to allow them to make preselections that are in the menu for their first order.  And then if they change their first delivery week before check out, they would invalidate their selections.  So, this challenge isn't exclusive to demand steering.

1 total reaction

Wanderley Teixeira reacted with ➕ at 2024-09-11 18:58 PM

[o]Why did the GoC team move away from this solution to use CRS?

[p]Added the reason as a con for the solution

[q]Would the idea be to duplicate the existing GoodChop solution or to  simply modify existing implementation?





Is the solution responsive? Will we be replacing the Single Question Flow with this pre-checkout meal selection flow too?

[r]The FJ solution can reuse majority of the existing Goodchop solution.





There should be no change to the single question flow as the precheckout meal selection is followed by Select Plan followed by magic link signup in the Progress Bar





@claire.wang@hellofresh.com correct me if otherwise

[s]Would we need to at least update the header/progress bar? I don't recall if the progress bar in SingleQuestionFlow is the same as the one in web

[t]This estimate includes creating a new meal selection page for the checkout flow ONLY if they are customer redirected from HF? Seems like this would add to a total time estimate > 1.5 sprints, imo (not by much, but probably a touch more than what is listed here)

[u]Or maybe includes repurposing GoodChop's solution for all brands? Feels like it still might be a bit more than 1.5 sprints but we'll see once a dev takes a closer investigation into building tickets

[v]The frontend precheckout meal selection will be repurposing the Goodchop frontend solution. 





Do you still see more effort estimate than what is listed?

﻿Pilot: Connie (Crlhuth)

Participant Details

Name: Connie

HelloFresh Experience: Has had HF in the past (she slipped through the screener)

Saves Recipes on Social Media: Daily

Cooks Recipes from Creators: A few times a week

# Food/Cooking Creators they Follow: More than 10





Current Habits

* Social Media Usage: Connie is a heavy social media user, primarily on Threads, Instagram, and TikTok. She consumes a significant amount of food content daily.

* Cooking Habits: She frequently cooks recipes found online (2–3 times a week), often modifying them or buying cookbooks from creators (e.g., B. Dylan Hollis, Joshua Weissman) to get clear written instructions.

* HelloFresh History: She is a former customer who loved the ingredient quality and service but canceled due to a lack of recipe variety.

* Household Needs: She cooks for a large household with the appetite equivalent of five adults.

________________





Reaction to the Concept

Connie’s overall reaction to the marketplace concept was highly positive, calling it "very innovative" and "exciting".

* Solves Key Pain Points: The concept addresses her two main issues:

   * Ingredient Waste: It eliminates the need to buy entire bottles of niche ingredients (e.g., red wine vinegar) for a single recipe.

   * Variety: It solves the boredom issue that originally caused her to leave HelloFresh by allowing her to curate a menu based on her favorite creators.

________________





Key Findings & Feedback

1. Pricing Sensitivity

* Cost Concern: Pricing is her primary concern. Because she feeds five adults, a significant price hike would make the service prohibitive.

* Expectation: She is willing to pay a "minor increase" for the influencer collaboration but stated she would not participate if the cost was significantly higher (e.g., a third higher) than standard meal kits.

* Creator Pricing: She is comfortable with creators setting their own margins, trusting that the creators she follows would price things fairly for their community.

2. Trust and Quality Control

* Vetting Process: Connie validates recipes by watching the video content first. If a creator is disorganized or unclear in a video, she assumes the written recipe will be poor and avoids it.

* Division of Responsibility: She expects HelloFresh to handle ingredient quality (which she already trusts) but believes the recipe quality is the influencer's responsibility.[a]

3. Feature Requests & UX Preferences

* Digital Cookbook: She desires a feature to consolidate and save recipes into a "digital cookbook" within the platform.

* Feedback Systems: She distinguishes between two types of communication:

   * Comments: For asking questions before cooking (on the recipe page).

      * She does not think recipe feedback would make sense to be added to the original social media post

   * Ratings: For providing feedback after cooking, which the influencer should use to adjust recipes.

* Curation Tools: She wants the ability to "heart" or follow specific creators and, crucially, a "mute" or "not interested" button to block specific creators and cuisines she dislikes.

* Video Integration: She expects the original video to be linked directly on the HelloFresh recipe page for reference.





Barinder (Bizzy-B)

Participant Details

Name: Barinder

HelloFresh Experience: Has tried Chefs Plate but not HelloFresh

Saves Recipes on Social Media: Several times a week

Cooks Recipes from Creators: A few times a month

# Food/Cooking Creators they Follow: More than 10





1. Social Media Habits

* Usage: Barinder describes her u

... [TRUNCATED: 16209 chars omitted to save context] ...

tyle book" or "Rolodex" where saved recipes are organized, specifically in alphabetical order.

   * Why she recommends it: She cooks based on "feeling" or cravings, so she needs an organized way to browse what she has saved previously.

   * Evidence: "I think like a Rolodex kind of like all the different recipes that you've saved and putting it in, you know, alphabetical order so you can come back and do it".

* Push Notification Reminders

   * What she wants: Configurable push notifications (or texts/emails) that nudge her to cook a saved recipe after a set time (e.g., 1 week, 2 weeks).

   * Why she recommends it: She saves recipes but forgets about them; she wants the app to ask, "You favorited this recipe two weeks ago. Did you want to order it?"

   * Evidence: "Having the ability to say, remind me in one week, remind me in two weeks... I think it would be helpful".

* Beginner-Friendly "Tips" & Instruction

   * What she wants: Extremely detailed instructions ("how to cut veggies"), videos, and basic cooking tips included with the kit.

   * Why she recommends it: She wants the instructions to be so clear that someone with zero experience (like her son) could make it without help.

   * Evidence: "If I could hand this to a person who's never looked at a pan... and they can do it... Like a really good step by step with pictures and videos".

* Ingredient & Protein Filters

   * What she wants: Filters to sort by "Main Course" (Protein type) and filters to exclude specific ingredients (e.g., "No onions").

   * Why she recommends it: She wants to navigate the marketplace based on what she feels like eating that night (e.g., Chicken).

   * Evidence: "Have it separated by the type of protein... seeing, like, if you want chicken that night... having filters... if you don't like, you know, onions".

* QR Code to Social Media

   * What she wants: A QR code on the physical recipe card that links back to the influencer's original social media video/profile.

   * Why she recommends it: To "connect the collaboration" and allow her to see the video tutorial and read other user comments while cooking.

   * Evidence: "When the recipe comes out, have QR codes that take you to their Instagram... so that you can pull up the video... and also see the videos with all the, you know, people at the bottom leaving those comments".

New Ventures Operational Overhead calculation



"How it works

This sheet provides the percentage of operational overhead (i.e. KTLO work per month). Each team has a dedicated tab. For this to work, you need to
* add the label KTLO to all Jira tickets that you consider KTLO work
* Make sure all tickets that move into the “resolved” state have assigned story points. Add the actual story point in hindsight for accurate operational overhead calculation
A cron job runs every night and updates this sheet. It used the resolved date to include a ticket in the calculation for a specific month.

Dec 5, 2025 | Hamed:Nikita 1:1

Attendees: Nikita Gorshkov Hamed Karimian





Notes

* OTP Launch → decision: to have FF turn on in W02, but everything should be ready by EOY





Options

	Pros

	Cons

	Decision

	Launch W50

	More time before AD/ND

Time to iterate if issues

Time to rollout gradually





	Won’t make it! 

Less time for e2e testing

	No Go

	Launch W51 (To 90% of users)

	Original plan

On-track from dev pov

Captures business value earlier (~$15k in revenue)





	Super risky as most devs are out (Jordon, Jan, Edwin, Emily, Daniel, Travis)

Super close to EOY

Might break something on Factor

Not enough time for gradual rollout

On-calls: Emily Stanek (W50), Paul Andrews (W51/52)

	Maybe

	Launch W51 

(To only 10%)

	Mitigates the risk

Collects some feedback before the peak

	Still risky (Not enough devs to support)

Limited business impact





	No Go

	Launch W02

(To 90% of users)

	Less risky (Devs available for support)

Still before the actual peak

Won’t break anything on Factor/FF

	Delayed launch

Opportunity cost





	Go! 

	  W46 2024 - W04 2025 → The market is pretty soft over the last few weeks of the year

* Mobile app prototype

   * Who’s the owner of Factor App? → Shopping experience () & Merchandizing (Elisa Marku Laura Mneimneh) 

* Early & Often slides

* Shopify redirects → We might change that in the future depending on the number of redirects

   * Net New users: from legacy to shopify

   * RTE users: from Shopify to legacy

ckable only — no code).





Recruit 10–15 representative users (existing customers or target personas).





Ask them to choose between:





Current “build-your-own” flow





The new “plan-based” flow





Ask follow-ups:





Which feels more tailored to you?





Which would you trust more?





How likely are you to purchase?





✅ Advantages: Fast qualitative signal; surfaces objections early.

💡 Tip: Use Figma Analytics or Maze metrics (time on screen, clicks) for light quant data.





Option 3: “Fake Door” Test in Live Site





Goal: Measure real interest from actual users without building full functionality.





On your live PLP or homepage, add a new section or banner:





“Introducing our new lifestyle plans — Performance, Focus, and Foundation.”

CTA: “Explore Plans.”





When users click, send them to a “Coming Soon” page or a short survey:





“We’re launching soon — tell us which plan interests you most.”





Measure clicks, plan preference, and sign-ups for early access.





✅ Advantages: True behavioral data from live traffic.

💡 Tip: Works well if your current site already gets meaningful volume.





Option 4: Email or CRM Campaign Test





Goal: Validate resonance of messaging and pricing.





Segment your customer base (athletes, busy professionals, general wellness).





Send A/B email variants — one promoting current product set, one promoting “plans.”





Measure CTR, click-to-checkout, or pre-order intent.





✅ Advantages: Zero dev time, quick pulse check on messaging effectiveness.





📊 How to Evaluate Results

Metric        Signal        Success Criteria

CTR / engagement        Do users click into plan-based offers more than product-based ones?        +15–20% vs. baseline

Intent (survey or fake door)        Are users more likely to say they’d subscribe?        Majority (>60%) positive

AOV (simulated)        When choosing a plan, is average intended spend higher?        +10–15% lift

Qualitative sentiment        Do users say the plan feels easier, more relevant, or trustworthy?        Positive pattern emerges





If 2–3 of these indicators trend positively, that’s a green light to justify design + dev investment for a live experiment.





🚀 Recommended Next Step (Low-Effort, High-Insight)





Build a simple Figma prototype with your three plans + “Choose Plan” CTA, and test it via qualitative plan. (Option 2)

,,

,Plan,Pricing Principles at Launch

,All,Max box price should be $250 

,Fresh/Topper/Mixed,Max freezer fill is 1/3 a small NYC apt freezer

,Fresh,Aim to price lower than TFD but only if we can make PC2 margins and economics work

,All,Charge shipping separate to box price

,All,Shipping free in first order

,All,Price per day for trial is same as for regular box before discount

,All,Price per lb does not need to decrease as calories increase within same plan although it should go in that general direction

,All,"If we ship the same amount of product, the price should be the same"

,,

,Step,Description

,1: Import costs,All costs by plan imported into pricing file

,2: Benchmark,Competitors benchmarked to build up their pricing curves

,3: Scenarios,"High level pricing scenarios chosen per plan - final scenarios chosen:
- Fresh: Match TFD prices excluding shipping fee. Fresh is headline price to fix rest to
- Mixed: Should be 5-15% below Fresh depending on size and margins
- Topper: Should be 55-62.5% of Fresh price for 50% of product depending on size and margins
- Dry: Should be lowest price and price at 38% margins"

,4: Smooth pricing,Scenarios lead to choppy pricing. This was then smoothed

,5: Check PC2 / ROIs,PC2 and ROI reviewed to increase prices and improve margins where they were low

,6: Make steps,"If giving the same qty of product for 2 or more different SKUs, the prices were matched to create some stepped pricing"

,,

,,

,Type,Elements to Change in Price Test

,Architecture issue,Ensure same amount of food in box is always the same price

,Architecture issue,Review price per Lb curves i.e. price per LB should go down as calories increase

,Architecture issue,Review PC2 margins by calories within plan; and PC2 margins across calories

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Air Dried price to have lower entry price point to increase TAM

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Fresh price to be more competitive with Farmers Dog & Ollie

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Mixed price to sit in appropriate area between Fresh & Air Dried (being wary where Pantry Fresh would be)

,Architecture issue,"Lower price for larger dogs more than smaller dogs to encourage share of larger, higher ROI dogs"

________________





Section I 

This section outlines the business problem, the metrics that you need to measure success, and the analytical use cases. This helps analytics and (if needed) data teams understand the details of the problem and evaluate if the existing data assets are sufficient to address the problem or do we need more data. 

1. Business Problem and Feature Overview

HelloFresh Group is addressing key challenges in its business by introducing One-Time-Purchase (OTP) capabilities, moving beyond its traditional subscription-only model. The company recognizes that limited purchasing flexibility has deterred potential new customers and past subscribers who are hesitant about long-term commitments. Furthermore, existing methods for one-off sales, such as those for seasonal boxes, have often relied on separate microsites or legacy internal systems, leading to a fragmented customer experience, operational inefficiencies, and increased costs. This new OTP initiative aims to streamline these processes and capture a wider market by offering greater flexibility, enabling new opportunities like cross-selling Factor meals, integrating Good Chop offerings, and supporting a future two-way marketplace, all while providing a more seamless and intuitive experience for both new and existing customers.





The core of the proposed solution involves creating a unified OTP user flow across HelloFresh Group brands, complete with transparent pricing, distinct cart and checkout processes, and integrated order management for all customer types. Key functionalities to be built include robust SKU management, differentiated menu configurations, automated order confirmations and tracking, and comprehensive backend integration for operations, logistics, and financial reporting. This strategic shift is projected to unlock significant incremental revenue, with estimates ranging from €24.7M to €28.8M in Total Customer Value Added (TCVA), driven by seasonal boxes[a][b] and Good Chop OTP experiments, as well as an anticipated increase in Average Order Value (AOV) from Factor cross-selling. The initiative also focuses on enhancing customer care support for OTP orders[c] and improving data analytics capabilities to monitor performance effectively.

[bn]Hi @ferran.punet@hellofresh.com kind reminder to complete the review the otp success metrics. This will help us move to the next step of planning for making those available.

[bp]thank you for the reminder! just went through it and left a few comments/questions

[bq]HI @sameer.doda@hellofresh.ca kind reminder to complete the review the otp success metrics. This will help us move to the next step of planning for making those available.

_Assigned to sameer.doda@hellofresh.ca_

[br]What FE tracking do we need to determine if someone is an OTP prospect?

[bs]We would need to create a parameter to check if users have an otp order.

[bt]@akar@hellofresh.com I added the OTP order rate here too for visibility, we can remove / rename later. I gave it a new status with 'under review'

_Assigned to akar@hellofresh.com_

[bu]This metric could also apply for reactivations IMO

[bv]Agree

[bw]What's the reason to not combine this with the mac table but stick to the order history table? 

Also, how do we treat users that convert on a subscription but do not end up getting a box? Based on the text here I assume we ignore them but then maybe we could state that in order to graduate to a subscription the user has to have had at least one box on said subscription

[bx]Very good point on empty activations. I will add that we will only count net activations.On the other point you made the tables listed here are to indicate the otp data availability and not how exactly we will calculate the metics. So for this one indeed we can join with mac :)

[by]These metrics can already be calculated using order_line_item table

[bz]Can be calculated already!

[ca]Since it is one-time purchase so what is the point of customer lifetime value

[cb]what cadence should we send when the user selects one time box? cadence is used for subscriptions only

[cc]Hi @crui@hellofresh.com will we have the delivery handle at this stage? Or is it related to address?

[cd]@akar@hellofresh.com can you help specify all of the events we need to add the box_type parameter? We need it to implement

Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Nikita Gorshkov outlined a plan to include a banner suggesting users try the marketplace beta for meat, featuring a one-off box for delivery with express checkout, to be included in the next delivery of dashboards. The team, including Beatrice Dimarucut and Nikita Gorshkov, discussed the technical implementation of one-time purchases (OTP) for active customers, weighing the ease of transferring addresses and choosing between using a proper endpoint or a redirect to Shopify. The main talking points focused on enabling OTP for active customers due to its low cost and potential revenue, which Beatrice Dimarucut agreed to move forward with using minimal UI work and a redirect to a plans page, pending confirmation with Alex.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Dashboards Delivery and Marketplace Banner Nikita Gorshkov introduced a plan for the next delivery involving dashboards, which would feature a banner suggesting users try the marketplace beta for meat earlier, leading to a full menu. The plan includes a specific banner for customers from a particular URL redirect that offers a one-off box for delivery in two days. Ideally, customer details like the address would transfer at checkout, potentially utilizing Shop Pay for express checkout (00:00:00).

* Technical Implementation for One-Time Purchases (OTP) Beatrice Dimarucut questioned the ease of transferring addresses and raised the choice between directing customers to Shopify or using a proper endpoint for one-time purchases (OTP) (00:00:00). Nikita Gorshkov preferred using a proper endpoint if the effort was the same as directing to Shopify (00:01:22), though they noted that if using a redirect to Shopify was significantly cheaper (e.g., 20% of the cost) it would be worthwhile (00:02:18). Beatrice Dimarucut confirmed that if it is faster, they would use the redirect, but expressed concerns about order management and needing to keep an entry point to direct customers back from Shopify (00:01:22).

* Leveraging Existing Prospect Experience Beatrice Dimarucut noted that the prospect experience already includes a component that redirects users with a one-time purchase order back to the plans page to order another box or subscribe. They concluded that after implementing this work for prospects, it would not be a significant effort to do the same for active customers if no UI changes are needed (00:02:18). Beatrice Dimarucut suggested it would be easier to do the implementation with the endpoint unless linking to specific occasion or preset boxes was required, which would involve more work (00:03:37).

* Capability of OTP for Active Customers The team discussed setting the OTP for active customers as a deliverable for Q1, which Nikita Gorshkov confirmed was already planned. Beatrice Dimarucut expressed lower confidence in the impact compared to the former customer use case, but Nikita Gorshkov emphasized that if the capability is cheap to deliver, it should be enabled, especially since they already support OTP for prospects and ex-customers. Nikita Gorshkov concluded that enabling OTP for active customers is "pure money," as it can potentially earn revenue without extra spending, even from a small number of customers (00:05:15). Beatrice Dimarucut agreed to move forward with the minimal UI work and redirect to a plans page with the OTP option as the first iteration, which they would confirm with Alex (00:05:15).

.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah. So I yeah I I I think I just didn't outline it in the the doc because like formers and prospects seems like in my view like the yeah the bigger use cases but there's nothing stopping us I think.

 

 

00:05:15

 

Beatrice Dimarucut: Um why did you have this in mind that like to set it as a deliverable for H1 I mean like

Nikita Gorshkov: Well, it already for Q1. Yeah, it was already there, but it's okay. Um, yeah. Fine.

Beatrice Dimarucut: yeah I from a technical perspective I don't think it's much work it's more just like I think from the use case perspective like I have I know I have lower confidence that it would do better than for example like former's use case.

Nikita Gorshkov: I think it's the wrong way to think about maybe I would think about this as sure the impact might not be there but I think the capability if it's cheap to deliver it the capability should be there if

Beatrice Dimarucut: Mhm.

Nikita Gorshkov: you have already the possibility to have OTP for prospects so for new customers or for ex customers. There's absolutely zero reason for you not to enable it for um uh for activives, especially if we don't have and we don't have any support for um uh for activives uh sorry for for discounts. Any customer, even if it's two customers, it's still 700 bucks potentially that you could earn without spending a dime.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Mhm. Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: It's pure money.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah. Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: Um, and we can work and see and get feedback from customers. That's my

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah. So I I I think if like the very first iteration is literally just to like expose this like minimal UI work and then you know redirect them back to um a plans page with the OTP option. Like I don't think that's a big lift. I can double check with Alex. If we're trying to link it with like maybe a slightly different product, so you know, occasion boxes, preset boxes, then that would be more work. But for the first one, like yeah, fair enough. I think we could do it first.

Nikita Gorshkov: Nice.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Okay, let me have a think where to place that. All right. Okay. Anything else?

Nikita Gorshkov: Cool. Nope.

﻿Final SOLUTION (WIP)

HelloFresh NL Premium Tier & Green Chef Migration - Solution Design Review





 Author(s): Vimal GargJolanta CariovaJoão Cheffer Prado

Last Update: Sep 25, 2025

Status: Draft | In Review | Final

Project Overview

This project consists of two sequential phases:

* M1: Green Chef NL to HelloFresh NL Migration

* M2: Premium Tier A/B Test for HelloFresh NL, BE & LU Active Customers

Key Questions

#

	Question

	Answer

	1

	How do we ensure seamless credential transition without requiring customers to create new passwords?

	We won’t reuse auth tokens. Customers will receive a magic link (or similar one-time login) to activate their new HelloFresh NL account, avoiding password creation at migration) however, they would still need to reset their password in case they log out from HF NL again since we cannot migrate password. We could support this with a clear password reset flow alongside the magic link.[a][b][c][d][e][f]

	2

	What's our approach for handling customers with existing HelloFresh accounts?[g]

	We could attach Premium Tier product-family to existing HF accounts with the same email instead of creating duplicates. This is technically feasible but would depend on a product (and legal) decision before implementation. All we need to do is basically changing their subscription plan to the newly created product-family for the premium tier.

João Cheffer Prado

	4

	What's the rollback plan if migration issues occur during W7 2026 delivery window?

	Customers would remain active on Green Chef, so rollback is essentially stopping the migration[h][i] job or just basically delete the “duplicated” account on HF NL or either require confirmation by email to validate before activation. Exact flow should be aligned with Product, but technically all options are possible.

	5

	How do we handle GDPR compliance[j] during the data migration process?

	Customer data is duplicated only for active NL customers with clear business purpose (service continuity) such as addresses and the payment token. Migration will follow GDPR principles: purpose limitation, data minimization (no historical orders[k][l][m]), audit trail, and secure handling in staging/production)

	6

	Green Chef Migration - Legal & Customer Segmentation?

* Can we migrate all active GC customers to Premium, or do we need consent-based opt-in due to BNL legal sensitivities?[n]

* How do we handle vegan/vegetarian customers where HF doesn't offer comparable options? (potential breach of dietary commitments)[o]

	



	7

	Pricing & Customer List Ownership

* MISSING: List of "high value" GC customers to be migrated[p] (who provides this list?)

	



	8

	Migration

* Cash credits / Hellocredit[q][r][s] migration approach - confirmed?

	



	9

	Preferences (to check with Katrien Oosterom) 

-  Can we have multiple different premium preferences (e.g., "Classic Premium" and "Healthy Premium")?

- any other challenges on preferences?[t]

	



	10

	Elysium[u] Dependencies & implications on timelines

- Jolanta Cariovato check if UX needs adjustments[v][w]

	



	11

	Experiment Allocation & Segmentation

* CDP or Statsig?

	



	12

	Data & Analytics

Tere Ledesma to define use cases and secure validation from the tech team. 





	



	13

	Technical[x] handover 

1. João Cheffer Pradoto cover how migration can work (POC done in the past[y][z][aa][ab])

2. Any other details on UX estimation /solution design

[hu]Alright, thanks!

[hv]@ra@hellofresh.com @gc@hellofresh.com can you please give feedback on this solution approach to enable preference management for NZ Saver plan

[hw]to check all the preference strings or the market default?

[hx]What is the market default?

[hy]@elyse.hill@hellofresh.co.nz who can answer this?

[hz]@rebecca.sukadana@hellofresh.com.au please can you confirm what the NZ Market default preference string is? TIA!

[ia]We currently in classic box have:

chefschoice (Classic - no choice)

family

veggie

quick

lowcalorie

lowcarb

protein

flexitarian





In saver plan

chefschoice (Classic - no choice)

[ib]I think there is also the use case of CC going in BOB or other CC tools and being able to change the preferences. Perhaps #squad-shopping-platform who own configuring the preferences in the backend know which clients consume them? Not sure if possible.

[ic]will check. I know in Bob and we are covering this in CC agent briefing.

[id]From our side, we do not need this. If the string is the same, the string is the same.

[ie]👍

[if]Theoretically no customer will have other pteference than chefchoice right? So this is rather a fallback in case they get a new preference somehow?

[ig]correct.

[ih]Why do we need this? Point f is a new feature (config hardcode). Shouldn't we trust that saver plan customers can only be allocated one preference?

[ii]agreed. removed it.

[ij]It should be totally fine.

[ik]👍

[il]1 total reaction

João Cheffer Prado reacted with 👍 at 2025-05-14 09:31 AM

[im]@jolanta.cariova@hellofresh.com can you check in context of NZ Saver if we need to communicate to customers that Saver plan comes with limited choice on the menu and explain what does having 1 option under preference mean?

1 total reaction

João Cheffer Prado reacted with 👍 at 2025-05-14 09:31 AM

[in]This is a valid risk, especially on the reactivation page where toggling plans affects menu preference visibility. We intentionally removed the single menu preference from the Saver plan on reactivation to avoid confusion as there would be no possibility to select anything, assuming that limited menu variety will be clear.

The Settings page offers more clarity, switching between plans shows 1 or 8 preferences, each with preference descriptions.

Let’s monitor this interaction and gather feedback to improve it if needed.

🛣️ Q2+Q3 Roadmap

Solenne, Ahmed, Tobias and I sat down and put our planned projects into a roadmap for Q2 and Q3. Tobias and Solenne presented this roadmap to Yoav and Annie and received good feedback about it. In the second tab of the spreadsheet we listed the priorities, with Porterhouse leading the list. Whenever we have to make a hard choice between two deliveries, we will decide for the one with the higher priority. That makes projects with lower priority more likely to be delayed than the ones with higher priority. If you have any concern of a high-priority project, please let Tobias and Solenne know as soon as possible.

💻 Tech Initiatives

                                                                                                                                    * The BFF migration in the mobile app is almost almost almost complete. We can expect the initiative to be complete early next week. There are still some cleaning up to do on web and mobile.

                                                                                                                                    * Last week we implemented a proof of concept of how we can migrate route access control to react components, and this we started with the migration of the access control function for the Cancellation page. By the end of next week, we should have also migrated the Delivery Tracking and RaF routes.

💸 Additional Vouchers

One of Engagement's sprint goals is to support Additional Vouchers in our price calculation logic for web and mobile. This week we started working on the website, refactoring the voucher Redux logic (🍝) and implementing the action to fetch a subscription's additional voucher info.

🔪 Killing Alice

This week we removed the last API call to Alice: update payment method in web. Before Alice is really killed in Intfood (expected mid April), we will need to do a force update of our mobile app to prevent users from using old versions that are still using the old endpoints.

🛒 Add-ons

The Happiness team started to implement some changes for Add-Ons, and was able to setup some add-ons SKUs in staging.

Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Laura Titherington, Jacob Gabiam - InComm, Nikita Gorshkov, Oliver Vicente, Phillip Pidoux-Koronya, and Elaine Tobin, among others, discussed the integration process and roles for HelloFresh’s new retail gift card program with InComm, covering the transferred value activation process, value management, and the use of PINs for redemption. Key technical and business requirements were debated, including InComm's ability to create custom-prefixed PINs, the data available in reporting for analytics (such as merchant name and location), and error handling with specific timeout thresholds and retry/cancel recommendations for "get status" and "redeem" requests. Participants also addressed the scope of integration, noting the preference for a variable load product from Elysa Viti and the need to finalize economics, particularly for the Costco program and the creation of separate or combined Canadian and US contracts, with Laura Titherington agreeing to inquire about a single North American agreement to simplify legal review for Elaine Tobin.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Meeting Setup and Introductions Laura Titherington addressed initial technical issues with Jacob Gabiam - InComm's audio connection (00:00:00). After resolving the audio problem, Laura Titherington stated that the purpose of the call was to discuss the transferred value integration and introduced Jacob Gabiam - InComm, who would answer questions, and Nikita Gorshkov, who would lead the discussion (00:01:25). A round of introductions followed, with attendees including Nikita Gorshkov (leading new ventures at HelloFresh) (00:02:29), Jacob Gabiam - InComm (Solutions Consultant at InComm) (00:03:29), Laura Titherington (Business Development for InComm Canada) (00:02:29), Oliver Vicente (Lead Channel Manager at InComm), Phillip Pidoux-Koronya (Director of Account Management at InComm Canada) (00:03:29), and Elaine Tobin (running gift cards and flyers for HelloFresh US/Factor) (00:04:36).

* Integration Process and Roles Jacob Gabiam - InComm outlined the steps for the integration, explaining that they would gather requirements and then send them out for PM assignment, with Oliver Vicente providing additional support until a Project Manager is assigned (00:03:29). Phillip Pidoux-Koronya clarified that their team will manage the relationship with HelloFresh, launch the product, and manage the program going forward after Laura Titherington hands off the contract. Elaine Tobin noted that HelloFresh is working as a North America unit to scope out and onboard with InComm for a new retail gift card program (00:04:36).

* Transferred Value Gift Card Activation Jacob Gabiam - InComm described the transferred value process for physical gift cards, where HelloFresh is not involved in the initial activation (00:05:38). The process involves the retailer scanning the IAB barcode, which InComm uses to mark the card as active for the requested amount. The consumer then uses the PIN on the back of the card to send a request to InComm via HelloFresh to validate the PIN and purchase; upon success, HelloFresh sends a redemption request, transferring the value. Nikita Gorshkov confirmed that the verification h

though um and see see what they if there's an opportunity to do a North American agreement for this. I I'm just not hopeful because they it hasn't been done in the past.

 

 

00:41:01

 

Elysa Viti: Okay. Like we're okay to have two different so it just like the main portion of the MSA usually is the same for both North um both countries.

Laura Titherington: Totally understand. Not typically how we do it. I will I will ask the question though.

Elysa Viti: Okay. Yeah. See if what your team can do. If not, like you said, if there was a red line version, you guys can provide. We just don't want that much. We don't want to create too much work for a procurement team, unnecessary extra work. Uh, and we don't want the US to have to launch a lot later than Canada.

Laura Titherington: Yeah.

Elysa Viti: We'd like to launch like similar timelines.

Elaine Tobin: Yeah.

Laura Titherington: Yeah, understood. So, let me take that back. Um, let me take that back. I I don't have an answer right now because I have to ask

Elysa Viti: Okay. All right.

Elaine Tobin: Yeah, I think the other thing of note is like given this request is going in after December 1st, I know our legal team isn't even going to like be able to review and finalize anything until like January. I think anything that we need signed off and reviewed the end of year was due a week ago. So like that's already setting our team back. If that means like Canada won't get finalized until sometime in January, then how long will it take for us, you know? So I think in terms of us like getting business case resourcing like US is just a much higher spend market. So we kind of need to be running in tandem for things to move on the Canadian side.

Laura Titherington: No problem. Let me see what we can do on our side.

Elaine Tobin: Okay.

Laura Titherington: All right.

Elysa Viti: Okay, we'll wait for the contract from you, Laura, and then if we have any questions.

Laura Titherington: Good. Yeah. So, I may hold on that until I get the answer of because there's no point in sending and unless, you know, because right now it as it stands, it's just a Canadian contract.

Elysa Viti: Yeah. Yeah. Okay, great. Awesome.

Elaine Tobin: Thank you.

Summary



Prateek Jajoo experienced a Confluence page access issue, which was  

resolved by Nikita Gorshkov granting access to anonymous users, who also  

clarified the meeting's purpose is for Prateek Jajoo's personal  

development, unblocking, and issue escalation, asking them to manage ETAs  

for the login page and app documentation. Prateek Jajoo updated on  

prioritizing login page features like text box visibility and language  

enhancement for conversion before Katrina's absence, seeking reviews from  

Nikita Gorshkov and Laura Doas this week, and also discussed deprioritizing  

social logins while raising concerns about the lack of recipe selection  

transparency on the checkout page, which Nikita Gorshkov agreed to test if  

inexpensive. Additionally, Prateek Jajoo sought clarity on the design  

review process with Laura Doas, with Nikita Gorshkov advising to consult  

Maria about the TPT experience preview or set up a separate small design  

review.





Suggested next steps





Prateek Jajoo will manage Nikita Gorshkov's expectations regarding the ETA  

for the plan and documents related to the login page and the app.



Prateek Jajoo will catch up with the PM who has more information on social  

login and include the reasons fo

... [TRUNCATED: 107 chars omitted] ...

e  

payment or checkout page by checking if the information is available and if  

there are customer complaints related to a lack of transparency.



Prateek Jajoo will check with Maria regarding the TPT experience preview or  

set up a small design review with Laurand Dovas to get feedback on the  

design changes.



Prateek Jajoo will get feedback from Doas today and, if concrete and  

aligned, will set up 30 minutes to socialize the design.



Prateek Jajoo will check again for access to the groups needed, after  

getting access to the new tribe new in Slide page.



Prateek Jajoo will raise a support request if the confluence page access  

issue is not resolved.

Summary



Nikita Gorshkov and Beatrice Dimarucut discussed "charge at checkout"  

refunds, noting that a week is too long for the process and that tracking  

refunded customers separately may be necessary, and they agreed to consult  

with Kag to clarify how refunds and cancellations are individually tracked  

in the AL system for paid orders. Nikita Gorshkov is introducing Beatrice  

Dimarucut to the Spur founders, whose competitive analysis tool addresses  

tracking and comparing flows to an ideal state, and they have financial  

approval to procure them as a supplier. Furthermore, Nikita Gorshkov is  

opening a CS5 role for Beatrice Dimarucut to mentor, providing career  

development and shoring up work with Yuri following Dio's departure, and  

assured Beatrice Dimarucut that potential resistance from Annie would be  

minimal due to the defined headcount structure and involvement of key  

people like John, Yuri, Seb, Alex, DA, and external folks from payments and  

customer care.





Suggested next steps





Beatrice Dimarucut will summarize the owl issues for Nikita Gorshkov.



Nikita Gorshkov will formalize the career development plan for Beatrice  

Dimarucut.



Nikita Gorshkov will create the promo case for the new headcount and talk  

with Jamba about the candidate to open the CS5 role.



The group will ask Kag if refunds and cancelled are individually tracked.

Here is our generic presentation deck:

In any case, we can have a zoom call first and/or meet up in person. How is

your availability next week?



Best,

Hi team,





HelloFresh 2025 Week 47 resulted in an overall menu score of 3.41 (-0.09 target

score of 3.50, -0.10 vs planned menu score of 3.51).





CPI Commentary: Scores this week were still greatly impacted by the

broccoli shortage with nearly 20% of all comments received mentioning

missing broccoli. Other recipes that missed included: Meatloaf a la mom

(commentary that gravy recipe was bad), super-quick market recipes

(currently being addressed by product team) and 2 recipes for side dishes

that ran as Thanksgiving specials.

Weekly Call-Outs:



   - SKU Launches:

      - R31 - steak was tough and fatty - DC TI: 28/252 | DC NJ: 24/252 |

      DC NW: 4/252; demand was 9.3 suggesting the concept is appealing but the

      meat quality was a detractor from overall score

Summary



Nikita Gorshkov outlined a plan to include a banner suggesting users try  

the marketplace beta for meat, featuring a one-off box for delivery with  

express checkout, to be included in the next delivery of dashboards. The  

team, including Beatrice Dimarucut and Nikita Gorshkov, discussed the  

technical implementation of one-time purchases (OTP) for active customers,  

weighing the ease of transferring addresses and choosing between using a  

proper endpoint or a redirect to Shopify. The main talking points focused  

on enabling OTP for active customers due to its low cost and potential  

revenue, which Beatrice Dimarucut agreed to move forward with using minimal  

UI work and a redirect to a plans page, pending confirmation with Alex.





Suggested next steps





Beatrice Dimarucut will clarify with Alex whether it will be easier to use  

the proper endpoint for the OTP flow and confirm the required work to link  

it with different products, such as occasion or preset boxes.



Beatrice Dimarucut will determine where to place the minimal UI work to  

expose the OTP entry point in the subscription flow and redirect users back  

to a plans page with the OTP option.



Nikita Gorshkov and Beatrice Dimarucut will work on seeing and getting  

feedback from customers.

Summary



Laura Titherington, Jacob Gabiam - InComm, Nikita Gorshkov, Oliver Vicente,  

Phillip Pidoux-Koronya, and Elaine Tobin, among others, discussed the  

integration process and roles for HelloFresh's new retail gift card program  

with InComm, covering the transferred value activation process, value  

management, and the use of PINs for redemption. Key technical and business  

requirements were debated, including InComm's ability to create  

custom-prefixed PINs, the data available in reporting for analytics (such  

as merchant name and location), and error handling with specific timeout  

thresholds and retry/cancel recommendations for "get status" and "redeem"  

requests. Participants also addressed the scope of integration, noting the  

preference for a variable load product from Elysa Viti and the need to  

finalize economics, particularly for the Costco program and the creation of  

separate or combined Canadian and US contracts, with Laura Titherington  

agreeing to inquire about a single North American agreement to simplify  

legal review for Elaine Tobin.





Suggested next steps





Laura Titherington will review the agreement and send it over as a draft to  

Elysa Viti and Aniva Lu today.



Laura Titherington will inquire about the level of interest from Walmart in  

working with HelloFresh on the gift card program for the 2026 launch.



Elysa Viti and Aniva Lu will go back with the analytics team after the call  

to figure out the pin requirements, including any prefix, and let Jacob  

Gabiam - InComm know.



Jacob Gabiam - InComm will send a quick recap email after the meeting and  

pinpoint where to find the list of response codes that are applicable to  

the transferred value integration.



Laura Titherington will follow up with the HelloFresh team regarding a  

potential North American agreement or a red line version of the contract  

and send the Canadian contract for their review.
