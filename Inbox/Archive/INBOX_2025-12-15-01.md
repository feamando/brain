﻿🚀 Recommendation and MVP Scope

Strategic Recommendation and MVP Scope[a]

Authors:  Annette MvdE (Design & Strategy), Katheryn Eckles (Research & Strategy)

Reviewers: 

Last updated: Dec 15, 2025



Table of content:

Executive Summary



1.0 The Problem

1.1 Recipe developers currently struggle with high effort and low returns on social media – the Marketplace could be the solution.

1.2 The audience, enthusiastic about the diversity and sources of inspiration, has difficulty with execution and is unsure who to trust.



2.0 Concept validation

2.1 Strong evidence for the initial assumptions

2.2 Creators request focus on three main areas: workflow efficiency, platform transparency/data, and maintaining quality control to protect their brand trust.

2.3 Customers have high expectations for the marketplace's UX, quality control, and pricing model. These features are critical for building trust and daily usability.



3.0 Solution: From MVP to Vision

3.1 MVP Creator: The most critical omission in the MVP should be complex features like automated recipe vetting and sophisticated AI trend analysis. Focus on the simple, high-impact features first.

3.2 MVP Customer: The MVP should focus on solving the core problems of ingredient access and recipe reliability while offering a flexible transactional model.

3.3 Vision Creator

3.4 Vision Customer





________________





Executive Summary





The goal of this strategic phase was to evaluate the desirability for a new business opportunity in the B2B2C sector and assess the risk before we start the experimental phase.

We’ve compiled research and insights with Food influencers (Hobbycooks – Chefs) and HelloFresh Prospects, fitting the profile segment of the Efficient Inspired and a high usage of social media for cooking and food content, to plan the vision and mvp path forward grounded in the needs and pains of our future customers and partners.





Overall, our research and user testing to date validates the interest and strategic value in providing for creators as well as customers (inspiration-execution gap).





________________









1.0 The Problem





1.1 Recipe developers currently struggle with high effort and low returns on social media – the Marketplace could be the solution.

Creators are spending huge amounts of time creating high-demand content (recipes) but are seeing low financial return and low audience conversion due to algorithm instability and logistical hurdles.



* Social Media Volatility: Creators operate in an environment where discoverability and audience connection are unreliable due to constantly changing platform algorithms.

* Operational Overload: Creators are overburdened by time constraints (5/6 mentions), struggling to keep up with content creation, trends, and business administration, which limits their consistency.

* Monetization Risk: Income is inconsistent and too reliant on external brand deals and declining ad revenue, creating a critical need for stable, diversified income streams.





1.2 The audience, enthusiastic about the diversity and sources of inspiration, has difficulty with execution and is unsure who to trust.

People who follow these creators have a high desire for the recipes (saves/shares), but the friction of execution (sourcing ingredients, waste, cost) stops the follower from actually cooking.

* Ingredient access and waste: The single most cited problem. Users hate buying large containers of niche or special ingredients (e.g., miso paste, red wine vinegar) for a recipe that only calls for a tablespoon, leading to pantry

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Score recipes based on clear formatting and completeness, and surface this as a reliability meter.

Step 3,Verify Column J - Check Questions to understand which question you need to answer:

,A - Provide evidence this KR results in the creation of assets in Column I - Comment.

,"B - Check column L - B. Does the KR result in economic benefit?

If the cell is highlighted with ‘Oops, there is no YP strategy provided for this KR’  you need to provide the YP/QAR strategy this KR is associated with on the OKR Management Tool - Column AP (Input - Tech Strategy) or you need to explain why this KR is associated with a strategy with an economic benefit.

If the cell is highlighted with ‘This KR is associated with KTLO but we believe it delivers benefit and results in the creation of assets. Please advise',  you need to help us map this KR to an economic benefit.

If the cell is highlighted with ‘KR not found on the OKR Tool’, please help us map days reported to another KR."

,"C - Change value in column M - C. Percentage of work reported in cap activities YTD that is actually capitalisable if the KR is set to not meet or canceled, if it is partially capitalisable, or if there is need to ensure teams are not reporting non-capitalisable activities.

Adam

   * Past 2 weeks: little has been done, most of the focus was solely on YP and re-org people ops

   * Small win: Created a /qa-test Claude Code command that is able to generate a test plan scenario (e.g. given a list of all the prices for specific zones, create a test report showing where are there pricing display errors)

   * Booked for 50% of AI Office Hours this week without re-announcement

   * Needed from the group: need feedback from people testing the /qa-test command - where it falls short, etc..

   * What’s in focus next? 

   * Introducing AI Bytes Office Hours to a wider audience of product managers & designers

   * Claude Code for Product Management Workshop w/ Ebrahim[a]

   * v0 procurement & next steps for how might we shift to a prototype first culture for consumer facing experiences

   * @Ebrahim/@Pep methodology of spec-driven development core concepts intro rotation? Sup? [b][c][d][e][f]

   * Also can we be a bit more specific of the goals of the teams’ you’re onboarding? 

   * I believe the focus right now should solely be on getting teams going with spec-driven development vs. whatever they’re doing themselves right now

   * What I need help with: 

   * Streamlining outbound efforts: templating our outbound efforts (e.g. daily tips, daily office hours, monthly workshop, weekly learning & development sources, weekly spotlight, etc..)

   * What I want us to focus on next:

   * Getting to AI-assisted PDLC faster - how can we split the effort of packaging since curation seems to have a lot of friction?[g][h]

n start slicing and dicing to creating effective tooling for - there are certain big rock efforts being made but there could be a bit more we could to speed up if we split it between us

[k]Connect with Srishti and Harneet on this

[l]OH MY THIS IS NICE! :)

[m]let's discuss in our 1:1 this week then briefly but my take on focus first would be on getting value out of it first then deciding if that value's worth keeping or moving over to an alternative product

[n]For which team? Consumer? Yarra and Abdel? (there's lots of taste profile teams haha

[o]@priscila.machado@hellofresh.com

[p]What's missing here?

[q]Out of curiosity, how often do we need to do competitive analysis?

[r]If we think this is really important I would DM people asking if they have something to share. If yes why they are not sharing it. Historically, I had way more survey answers when messaging people direct and trying to figure out why they where not answering it.

[s]Could we have access to the files @ekar@hellofresh.com ?

_Assigned to ekar@hellofresh.com_

[t]@adam.ghanem@hellofresh.com idea: could we video record these session, and later on create some snap shot videos (like Youtube shorts) and post it in the channel

_Assigned to adam.ghanem@hellofresh.com_

[u]Can we schedule a demo

[ab]Sounds good - let's see what we could do

[ac]This would be great for the strategizer agent

[ad]@nikita.gorshkov@hellofresh.com should we give this to AI lab ppl to run and scale, since its going to be used by all teams?

### EMAIL: Farewell
ID: 19b220b56412d7c9
From: Karolina Zak <kza@hellofresh.com>
----------------------------------------

Dear all,



After nearly a decade, it’s time for me to say goodbye. It’s been an

incredible and fast-paced journey, full of twists, challenges, and

memorable moments along the way. Meeting so many great people and working

on such interesting problems has shaped me in ways I’ll always carry with

me, both professionally and personally.



Thank you for being part of this long ride. I’m truly grateful for the time

we’ve shared.



If you’d like to say goodbye in person, I’ll be around on *Thursday at AHM

and the CMA Afterparty*. And of course, we can stay in touch online:

LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/karolinazak/

Email: kkarolinazak@gmail.com



I’m staying in Berlin, so hopefully our paths will cross again someday 🙂



Karo.

### EMAIL: [ACTION REQUIRED] Roadrunner deprecation – we need your input
ID: 19b220aca816268b
From: Konstantin Rohleder <kro@hellofresh.com>
----------------------------------------

Hi everyone,



As part of the larger monolith deprecation, we’re starting the replacement

of Roadrunner (the service that copies data from the Bob database into S3

(PII and non-PII tables like customer, subscription, sales_order, etc.)).



Over the next months we’ll replace these tables with data coming from new

sources (for example Kafka topics), and we’re now entering the discovery

phase.



What do we need from you?



👉 If you or your team rely on any of the Roadrunner / Bob tables in S3

<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_OxIXKj1nW7fQOWXAnL7g92NEEas0HQScUR2B7OBvtw/edit?gid=903236197#gid=903236197>,

please reach out in #roadrunner-replacement

<https://hellofresh.slack.com/archives/C0A36GCUE7L> or ping me directly, so

that we have a dedicated point of contact.



We will set up a session to gather your input on:



   -



   which fields/tables you use

   -



   how critical they are

   -



   any specific access or market restrictions you depend on





There is no immediate shutdown, but we want to avoid surprises later by

mapping all active use cases now.



Thanks a lot for your help!



Best,



--
