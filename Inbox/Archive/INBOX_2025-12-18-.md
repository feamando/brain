Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

The team, including Shishir Mishra and Michael Lucero, discussed the target process for pre-cut off order cancellations and refunds via the AL system, with Shishir Mishra confirming the ideal process is to mark the order as "not shipped" and cancel the payment, a process known to agents. Gangadharan Khoteeswarun (Ganga) identified a bug in the payments domain, affecting automatic refund reconciliation for CNC orders and partially paid orders using process out, which means refunds only occur after the cut off, and stated that a fix is being tested for deployment to production soon. Participants including someone in Lower Feast Side (United States-NYCHQ, 7), Shishir Mishra, and Hagag discussed agent processes, clarifying that cancellations do not happen via ART, and also addressed the confusion surrounding payment status and refund visibility for CNC orders before and after cutoff.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Target State for Cancellation and Refund The team discussed the desired process for canceling and refunding initial orders pre-cut off via the AL system, which is the target state, moving away from Bob. Shishir Mishra confirmed that the ideal process involves marking the order as "not shipped" and canceling the payment (00:03:15) (00:08:01), noting this process is known by agents and replicates Bob's behavior (00:08:01) (00:12:07). Michael Lucero noted an earlier understanding was to market as "shipped" and then cancel payment, indicating some confusion around the correct steps (00:01:02).

* Bug Affecting Auto Reconciliation and Refund Timing Gangadharan Khoteeswarun (Ganga) identified a bug in the payments domain related to the new payment service provider, process out, where automatic refund reconciliation is missing in the configuration (00:02:11) (00:05:02). This means that without the fix, the refund will only be received after cut off, even if delivery is canceled (00:04:05) (00:19:49). The issue primarily affects charge at checkout (CNC) orders and any partially paid orders that require an automatic refund through process out (00:05:02).

* Bug Resolution and Deployment Timeline Gangadharan Khoteeswarun stated that the fix is currently being tested in staging and they expect to be able to move it to production tomorrow, despite a delivery freeze, confirming after testing is complete (00:06:55). This fix, which is only for the auto-refund cases after the cutoff, is expected to unblock the cancellation and refund process for pre-cut off CNC orders, though the refund will still only occur after cutoff (00:27:14).

* Agent Processes and Error Reporting Someone in Lower Feast Side (United States-NYCHQ, 7) raised the question of whether agents should use the Error Reporting Tool (ART) for cancellations and refunds, but Shishir Mishra clarified that cancellations do not happen via ART (00:01:02) (00:03:15). Shishir Mishra emphasized that the target process is the mark as "not shipped" and cancel payment method (00:03:15) (00:08:01), which agents are already trained on from the Bob system (00:13:40). Hagag explained the difference between canceling an order and canceling a payment operation, noting that "Mark order is not as not shipped" prevents deliv

ads up because there is no order on payment

 

 

00:27:14

 

Lower Feast Side (United States-NYCHQ, 7): Okay.

Gangadharan Khoteeswarun: side.

Lower Feast Side (United States-NYCHQ, 7): So, is it an extra step to expose those transactions via owl or it should work out of the box once the bug fix is

Hagag: Gotcha.

Lower Feast Side (United States-NYCHQ, 7): done?

Gangadharan Khoteeswarun: No. uh that needs to be adapted on the owl to call this endpoint and show the information in whatever needed form. The bug fix is only for auto refund cases after the cutff.

Lower Feast Side (United States-NYCHQ, 7): Okay. Okay, then. So,

Nikita Gorshkov: It's another action point.

Lower Feast Side (United States-NYCHQ, 7): we'll p Yeah, let's put that as a second action point. Correct me if I'm wrong,

Nikita Gorshkov: Mhm.

Lower Feast Side (United States-NYCHQ, 7): but it sounds like as soon as the bug fix is done and at least like this should unblock us, right? like cancellation and refund will work. There might it's still maybe like not the clearest for agents to see, but like um from what I can tell basically what will happen is that the delivery status changes to like that dash instead of running and then payment status is is canled.

 

 

00:28:18

 

Lower Feast Side (United States-NYCHQ, 7): So that should tell the agent that it worked but still we will need like they will get money back only after cut off even after the fix. Yeah. So like that's a known limitation we can live with I think right now. So it's like three weeks out max. Yeah. But yeah I think this is otherwise it will require more changes to Yeah. like secondation.

Nikita Gorshkov: But it's something we can maybe address and I don't think that this will affect too many customers.

Lower Feast Side (United States-NYCHQ, 7): Yes.

Nikita Gorshkov: Um so yeah it's it's manageable but yeah the second one ideally we would also address going forward.

Lower Feast Side (United States-NYCHQ, 7): Okay. Okay. So, in case I done once you're done on production, please let us know. We'll double check again with live order and see how it works.

Gangadharan Khoteeswarun: Yep, I'll do

Lower Feast Side (United States-NYCHQ, 7): Yeah.

Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Ian Brooks initiated a discussion about launching a Shopify store in Canada to block out competition, with planned resources for March from Ian Brooks and Kevin to handle sales. Nikita Gorshkov detailed resource constraints due to the GC Netherlands migration blocking the implementation team until February, making a "lift and shift" of the US B2B Shopify store setup using Anata the most straightforward approach. Ian Brooks confirmed that a minimal integration pilot, focusing on a simple storefront and data output without SCM integrations for small volumes, would be sufficient to proceed, and Nikita Gorshkov noted that existing contracts with the US entity for factor, covering Shopify and Anata, would likely allow the Canadian business to piggyback on them.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Canadian Shopify Store Launch and Competition Ian Brooks initiated the discussion regarding the launch of a Shopify store in Canada, motivated by an approach from a competitor and an existing interest in blocking out competition. They mentioned that they and Kevin had been planning resources for March to handle the sales side, believing the timing was right and the break-even point was not "crazy". Nikita Gorshkov cautioned about the complexities of the launch, noting that the most straightforward approach would involve using Anata, who handled the US B2B Shopify store for factor, to "lift and shift" the setup for Canada (00:00:58).

* Resource Constraints and Technical Challenges for Canada Launch Nikita Gorshkov detailed resource constraints, explaining that the team capable of implementing the Canada country launch would be blocked throughout January and into February due to the GC Netherlands migration, which has a deadline of the 30th to deliver all migrated GC customers to HelloFresh (00:00:58). The technical difficulty involves disabling and stripping out existing US functionality, such as katana integrations, and confirming if the fulfillment systems and DC setups are the same between the US and Canada. Nikita Gorshkov clarified that the storefront is the easiest piece, but the fulfillment method is the key challenge (00:02:11).

* Minimal Integration Requirement for Pilot Ian Brooks emphasized that for an early stage pilot with small volumes (break-even at 450 meals a week), all they require is the storefront and a simple data output, like an Excel spreadsheet or a database query, with "no integrations on the SCM". They stated that the US tends to make these things unnecessarily difficult and suggested they could rely on Danielle's team or Jigger for manual production plan manipulation for the small volume pilot (00:02:11). Ian Brooks proposed that if the pilot takes off, they would then have a business case to allocate resources for full integrations (00:03:24).

* Vendor and Contract Status for Shopify Store Nikita Gorshkov shared that a PM could handle a simple storefront setup with minimal engineering support, using knowledge gained from the VMS store launch and the upcoming Good Shop store launch in January. However, they pointed out that contracts only exist with the US entity for factor at the moment, covering Shopify and Anata (00:04:33). Ian Brooks learned that Anata manages the storefront setup, CRM systems, design work, and integration with endpoints, while the internal team handles URL setup, tracking pipelines, and internal system integrations (00:05:38). Ian Brooks suggested that as an

on the back end, but they will fulfill 100% of orders on time. And if we get something out of this, then we get something out of this. The sales guys are basically saying, you know, we should not be selling weekly subscriptions here. We're selling annual subscriptions. So, this is an annual sale with weekly uh potentially

Nikita Gorshkov: H

Ian Brooks: meal selection. Or I might even say, you know what, we're going to send them our menu every month. And then like we we we will Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: because that's what works, right?

Ian Brooks: So we need to make this easy on all sides and we need to think differently on it. But anyway, okay. I will leave it with you. Um we're going to run this sales What's

Nikita Gorshkov: I'll get back to you by Friday. Uh,

Ian Brooks: that?

Nikita Gorshkov: I'll get back to you by Friday. We have the our meeting on Friday.

Ian Brooks: Thank you.

 

 

00:09:27

 

Ian Brooks: We're going to run this sales pilot, Nikita, no matter what. Okay. Um but I want it to succeed.

Nikita Gorshkov: H

Ian Brooks: And so I think if we can bring a shopfront online um sometime in January um that would be an ideal case.

Nikita Gorshkov: Mhm.

Ian Brooks: Um but as I said I need no integration behind the

Nikita Gorshkov: Mhm. Okay.

Ian Brooks: scenes.

Nikita Gorshkov: What I'll do in the meantime, uh, and I'll intro you to Nurev, uh, who's the chairman for the agency. Let's just ask him for, hey guys, like this is what we need, how much it will cost, just to give us a a a price.

Ian Brooks: You

Nikita Gorshkov: And then we we've able to actually negotiate the price down to by 30% on the good shop

Ian Brooks: know,

Nikita Gorshkov: side just as a thing by cutting corners here and there. Uh so I think it's um it's not unfeasible or 25. Um and then uh yeah,

Ian Brooks: Okay.

Nikita Gorshkov: let's get the price from them. In the meantime, I'll get back to you from what Samir and Ally told me. I'll talk with Ally today and she'll start digging here as well.

Ian Brooks: Okay, man. Appreciate you. Yes, that's fine. We're We are an associated business of the US. We can probably just piggyback the contract. Most likely the contract will cover us anyways.

Problem Statement

Social media has become a primary hub for culinary inspiration, where people turn to influencers to discover new recipes. While Followers struggle to find the necessary ingredients and an easy way to re-cook them, Influencers look for new revenue streams to be more independent from the heavily controlled platforms and find new ways to expand their reach and engage with their audiences authentically and organically via food.





Opportunity:

Hellofresh sees a huge opportunity to serve both: by transforming influencers' inspiration (recipe) into a shoppable, cookable meal kit for the consumers. 

By bridging the gap as the Expert in operation, warehouses and logistics, we provide customers a way to enjoy these recipes easily and the influencer to serve their followers and create a new revenue stream. The social commerce market is growing rapidly and can represent a huge opportunity for us to attract new customers.





Why now:

We see the urgency to act now, because influencers are already trying to solve this problem with links to ingredient orders  via Instacart or Pinterest partners with Instacart to enable 1-click grocery list generation from saved pins. But today, shoppable content on social media within the food category is often limited to individual food items as opposed to a holistic offering where the ingredients for entire recipes and direct delivery can be purchased. 





The Core Ask 

WBD: Influencer Marketplace

Explore desired and viable vision for a curated recipe creator marketplace (1. influencer, 2. Aggregators) with the option of an  instant purchase as a meal kit ‘fulfilled by HelloFresh’.





Long-term Vision (Later) 

Transform HelloFresh into the “Spotify for food”  a platform where any creator can share a recipe that HelloFresh fulfills.

﻿Interview: Cheatdayeats

Influencer: Jessica Hirsch of Cheatdayeats

Main Socials: Instagram, Tiktok

Following Size: Instagram 559K, Tiktok: 114K

Content focus: Comfort food with with interesting twists and formats

Interview Date: Nov. 14, 2025

Part 1: Creator Background

* Primary Goal: Her main goal is building a strong community and establishing trust with her followers. She wants her content to be accessible, fun, and easy, focusing on recipes that are not overly complex (e.g., 5 ingredients, 15 minutes).

* Content & Platforms: Her content has evolved from featuring restaurants to focusing on her own recipes.

   * Her main platforms are Instagram and TikTok, but she is also building on YouTube, Facebook, and Threads.

   * She noted that her Instagram audience feels more like a "hardcore" community, while TikTok feels more random and driven by the "For You" page.

   * She tailors content, finding that TikTok performs better with longer, descriptive videos, whereas Instagram favors short, quick videos.

* Workflow & Tools: She works as a two-person team with her husband. He assists with filming and emails, while she handles most of the editing and community engagement. She uses Capcut and Premiere Pro for editing.

* Monetization: Her income is primarily from brand deals and creating UGC (User-Generated Content) for brands. She makes some money from the TikTok fund but finds the monetization rules across platforms to be confusing and hard to keep up with.

* Biggest Challenges:

   * The Algorithm: Her single biggest challenge is connecting with her audience due to the "ebb and flow" of platform algorithms. She struggles to know if low engagement is due to her content or the algorithm simply not showing it to her followers.

   * Time & Trends: As a small team, she finds it challenging to be consistent and invest time across all platforms. If she could delegate one task, it would be keeping up with all the different platform-specific trends, audios, and algorithm changes.

________________





Part 2: The HelloFresh Concept & Feedback

Value Proposition

* Her initial concern was cost and timeliness versus just using Instacart.

* However, she quickly saw the value in providing exact, pre-portioned ingredients, noting she has also bought an expensive spice just to use it once.

* She felt the concept would be especially powerful for recipes involving unique, expensive, or hard-to-find ingredients, like pistachio paste for the viral Dubai chocolate trend.

Ingredient Strategy & Value

The core value for users will come from the ingredients. Jessica stressed that the program must:

* Focus on Unique/Specialty Items: The program's biggest draw would be providing ingredients that are hard to find, expensive, or unique. This creates a clear value-add over a user just going to their local supermarket.

* Highlight Pre-Portioned Savings: The program should emphasize the value of providing exact portions of expensive ingredients (like saffron or pistachio paste) so the user doesn't have to buy a large, costly jar for a single recipe.

* Ensure High-Quality Ingredients: Jessica was very clear that the quality of the ingredients is critical. She noted that for recipes with few ingredients, the quality matters a lot (e.g., "which sharp cheddar" is being used).

Creator-Follower Connection

The program must be designed to enhance, not just use, the creator's existing community.

* Create a "Full Circle" Loop: Jessica suggested including a QR code or link in the box that directs the user back to the creator's original post, website, or

his would be a menu to choose from, yes, but for now the creator becomes the storefront so I dont see this as a problem

[s]But this is valuable, of course I want to get on the recipe page and not the overview page, we could have created a screen before

[t]We saw this reaction in the other interview as well

[u]We saw this in the last interview as well

[v]This is a question that keeps popping up. 





Some questions that are commonly brought up are: 

How would we do that exactly? 

Would the video need captions with the full recipe in them? 

What happens if it is not accurate?

[w]this was mentioned before in a different interview

[x]Similar feedback from the interview with Shadi as well

[y]This feedback keeps coming up

[z]Wanting more ways to sort the recipes on this page and identify allergens is a common comment here whether that is adding more categories, filtering options, or additional tags with info on the cards.

[aa]This is a common concern on this page. Most expect and want it to be calculated (which I think we would since we already have that capability internally)

[ab]This keeps coming up here

[ac]Something the recipe creator could think of doing variations of the recipe for vegan/gluten-free options

[ad]this is valuable concern, that needs to be put into contract details but also on the landingpage for creators to understand the offering

[ae]I think this part is all about how to sell the platform, that this is her store online, not the hellofresh platform

[af]concerns we had as well. Balancing information and tunnel view in their creativity

[ag]Maybe more interesting trend data by looking at their types of recipes and suggesting interest from users

[ah]reasonable, i wonder if this creator would be a fit for the platform. She stated already creating recipes most people do not like, with special ingredients hard to get

[ai]This is a consistent comment here

[aj]we do that

[l]OH MY THIS IS NICE! :)

[m]let's discuss in our 1:1 this week then briefly but my take on focus first would be on getting value out of it first then deciding if that value's worth keeping or moving over to an alternative product

----------------------------------------

﻿Discount Communication Presets

Contributors: Ipek KalenderAnastasiya BelkinaShay Ben Yacov

Context

Discount communication presets are predefined fields that allow marketing teams to display discount-related messages or offers on various parts of the website. These presets control the content that appears at key customer touchpoints, located on pages such as Landing Pages, Plans Page, Checkout, Reactivation pages.

Marketing Teams can customize the discount messages based on the field presets e.g. Team can decide to display Free Dessert for Life for some users and Free Snacks for life for others. Each preset field controls specific touchpoints on the site, ensuring a consistent and clear message to customers across the user journey.

Touchpoints itself are owned by different product teams, who manage the placement and configuration of the fields, while marketing handles the content. 

All touchpoints integrated with Communication Presets are listed in documentation.

Governance Process for Adding New Discount Communication Touchpoints

The ownership of discount communication is spread across multiple teams product teams own the touchpoints, while marketing teams handle the benefit communication. This requires teams to be aligned on all available fields. Whenever a new field is introduced, it is critical that the team responsible for that section ensures alignment with marketing.

Notification when new field is added

1. Notification to Marketing & Product Teams via Slack

Each time a team plans to add a new discount communication field, they are required to send a message in a dedicated Slack channel (e.g., #discount-communications-updates). This notification will contain the following information:

Slack Message Template:

* Subject: New Discount Communication Touchpoint Field

* Team: [Insert team name]

* Brand: [Insert Brand (All/ HelloFresh/RTE/Mealkit]

* Field Details:

   * Field Name: [e.g., Discount_Slogan]

   * Field Description: [Briefly describe the purpose and content of the field, e.g., "A promotional slogan displayed on the landing page."]

   * Touchpoint Location: [Specify the page and exact location, e.g., "Landing Page - Banner Section."]

   * Content Guidelines (if applicable): [Any limitations, e.g., "Max 50 characters; no special characters."]

   * Link to Documentation: [Link to the updated internal documentation, which should include a screenshot of where the touchpoint is located on the website.]

* Planned day of Roll Out: [e.g., 23-Sep]

* Expectations from Marketing: [e.g., for this field to be filled out for all Activation presets that are in use]

2. Confirmation 

Upon posting in Slack, P&D Teams must confirm receipt of the message and ensure they:

* Understand the new field’s purpose and placement.

* Have coordinated and finalized updating marketing strategies/content to include the new touchpoint.

* Acknowledge any guidelines, limitations, or formatting rules.

[!] Please wait until both 1 POC from both NA and International P&D to confirm they are aligned with the changes.

3. Documentation Update

Update the documentation for the new field. Documentation must include:

* Field name and description

* Page(s) and sections where the touchpoint is active

* A screenshot or visual aid highlighting where the new touchpoint is located.

* Usage guidelines, including length, format, and content rules

* Clear directions on how marketing can use the new field

4. How to implement a new field

[k]@anb@hellofresh.com should we break this down as there will be 4 different inputs under this section?

_Assigned to anb@hellofresh.com_

[l]It seems as if this was a shared module over Contentful and this has resulted in Tommy's experiment causing our title to change. Should we also mark these shared modules over Contentful w/ Kiran's support?

[m]@harneet.singh@hellofresh.com Can we de-preciate this field or it is always re-used for experimentation?

_Assigned to harneet.singh@hellofresh.com_

[n]I would like to keep it, it's always reused for experiments

[o]Should we actually consider separating Activation and Reactivation presets? I think this causes a lot of confusion

[p]Yes, this would be a good idea if we see a lot of dedicated fields per customer journey

[q]Was created for an A/B test. No longer actively in use, but can be "recycled" for a future test

[r]Note both this field and the one for F4X limited time will add a "+" between the organic modal message and the F4X claim. 





This copy will also apply to the exit intent modal

[s]Is there a visualized documentation I can find on Reactivation input fields?

[t]I didn't fully understand - currently the experimentation on green banner is available?

[u]not in use after the overlaps with the other landing pages

[v]@anb@hellofresh.com are we confident with these experiments that they didn't bring an uplift? Also were these experiments tested with presets or w/o presets? I am curious on understanding the set-up

,Accessibility-2025 Program,,,,,,,,,,Recent action Items,,,,,,

,Welcome! The Accessibility-2025 Program will enable HelloFresh Group to complete HelloTech Objective #4 and comply with the modern level of accessibility for our customers driven by The European Accessibility Act (EAA). The program has two goals:,,,,,,,,,,🔄,"Resolve 90% of the P1 issues identified through Cypress that break 11 WCAG rules and manual audits in WEB.
Deadline: December 31st.",,,,,

,1,"Reduce the number of ""important"" Accessibility issues in HelloFresh, GreenChef, and Factor by 90% in WEB experiences by 28 June 2025, and in Mobile experiences by 31 Dec 2025.",,,,,,,,,🔄,"Resolve 90% of the P0 issues identified through Cypress that break 4 WCAG rules and manual audits in REACT NATIVE.
Deadline: December 31st.",,,,,

,2,Establish accessibility standards to support future HelloTech product development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Current P90 compliance,,,,,,source

,Background,,,,,,,,,,WEB,,,,MOBILE,,

,"The European Accessibility Act (EAA), which mandates that websites and mobile applications comply with WCAG 2.2 Level AA accessibility standards, will come into effect on June 28, 2025. The directive applies to all businesses in the EU, including HelloFresh. Non-compliance can result in penalties such as fines (ranging from 500–500k€) or, in some countries like Ireland, even prison sentences. Companies may also face legal action from disability advocacy groups.",,,,,,,,,,35%,,,,15%,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Remediating the risk of fines requires a company-wide collaboration, which is the background of launching this program. Apart from avoiding fines, improved Accessibility in our interfaces also gives us access to new potential customers (with disposable income) who previously may not have considered our product because they functionally were prevented from doing so. There is no calculated business case for the Group yet, but we plan to dig deeper into the opportunity in H2. The program will be driven by Foundations Alliance and involve all CFAs teams owning Front End TRE in mobile or web.",,,,,,,,,,2025 compliance target,,,,,,source

,,,,,,,,,,,WEB,,,,MOBILE,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Foundations Alliance made all Zest components compliant with EAA standards out of the box, however, this does not guarantee full compliance. To achieve full compliance by June 2025, all CFAs will review their journeys and modify them as needed. 

Foundations Alliance has provided the following inputs to enable CFAs to minimize their efforts:",,,,,,,,,,53%,,,,20%,,

, ☑️,"Improved Zest Design System components for iOS, Android, Web, and React Native platforms to have complete compliance with accessibility guidelines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New Ventures Operational Overhead calculation



"How it works

This sheet provides the percentage of operational overhead (i.e. KTLO work per month). Each team has a dedicated tab. For this to work, you need to
* add the label KTLO to all Jira tickets that you consider KTLO work
* Make sure all tickets that move into the “resolved” state have assigned story points. Add the actual story point in hindsight for accurate operational overhead calculation
A cron job runs every night and updates this sheet. It used the resolved date to include a ticket in the calculation for a specific month.

[w]@nikita.gorshkov@hellofresh.com to talk to @mateusz.borowiak@hellofresh.com

[x]Note for Self: they are modifying the conversion event.

[y]@aw@hellofresh.com

[z]@lgui@hellofresh.com FYI for updates

[aa]Replied under each question

[ab]Thansk Ahmed!

[ad]https://hellofresh.atlassian.net/browse/TPT-480

[ae]@anisha.chandra@hellofresh.com do you agree this is the right statement for AAFCO?





@dovas@hellofresh.com FYI

_Assigned to anisha.chandra@hellofresh.com_

[af]This is the official statement "formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the

AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials) Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for All Life Stages, including growth of large size dogs (70 lbs. or more as an adult)"

[ag]If we need shorter, then I'm ok shortening to what NOM Nom have in their FAQ which is "Recipes meet standards set by AAFCO’s Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for all life stages."

[ah]@wellney.yarra@hellofresh.com - does it all go through you, or we can also add tix?

[ai]should we move the existing UI fix tickets to this epic?

[aj]@bowang.dai@hellofresh.ca have you had a chance to check this one?

_Assigned to _

[ak]Sorry, didn't get a chance to speak to this yesterday! Yes! I have reach out to squad consumer core. They have updated the reporting tab is no longer a supported feature. They only way to see recent conversions is via the DWH.

[al]I am currently reaching out to global BI to see how this information is pulled from DWH and which report pulls this information.

[am]FYI @dovas@hellofresh.com 





Thanks Bo!!

[an]gotcha - thanks you. maybe you can check if we can use "marketing report extract" from tableau?

[ao]Sorry team for missing this meeting as I was off. @dovas@hellofresh.com and @wellney.yarra@hellofresh.com is this the finalized RAF Values? 50% off the trial box and 20% off on the next two boxes? Is this correct?

[ap]Hey! Nope these were just example of the first box discount. For RAF it will be 100% off trial box, just pay for shipping and a TBD credit customer will earn for successful referrals

________________





Section I 

This section outlines the business problem, the metrics that you need to measure success, and the analytical use cases. This helps analytics and (if needed) data teams understand the details of the problem and evaluate if the existing data assets are sufficient to address the problem or do we need more data. 

1. Business Problem and Feature Overview

HelloFresh Group is addressing key challenges in its business by introducing One-Time-Purchase (OTP) capabilities, moving beyond its traditional subscription-only model. The company recognizes that limited purchasing flexibility has deterred potential new customers and past subscribers who are hesitant about long-term commitments. Furthermore, existing methods for one-off sales, such as those for seasonal boxes, have often relied on separate microsites or legacy internal systems, leading to a fragmented customer experience, operational inefficiencies, and increased costs. This new OTP initiative aims to streamline these processes and capture a wider market by offering greater flexibility, enabling new opportunities like cross-selling Factor meals, integrating Good Chop offerings, and supporting a future two-way marketplace, all while providing a more seamless and intuitive experience for both new and existing customers.





The core of the proposed solution involves creating a unified OTP user flow across HelloFresh Group brands, complete with transparent pricing, distinct cart and checkout processes, and integrated order management for all customer types. Key functionalities to be built include robust SKU management, differentiated menu configurations, automated order confirmations and tracking, and comprehensive backend integration for operations, logistics, and financial reporting. This strategic shift is projected to unlock significant incremental revenue, with estimates ranging from €24.7M to €28.8M in Total Customer Value Added (TCVA), driven by seasonal boxes[a][b] and Good Chop OTP experiments, as well as an anticipated increase in Average Order Value (AOV) from Factor cross-selling. The initiative also focuses on enhancing customer care support for OTP orders[c] and improving data analytics capabilities to monitor performance effectively.





Refer to this doc for product requirements: PRD: Enabling One-Time-Purchase (OTP) Capabilities for HelloFresh Group

Technical Implementation plan: OTP Proposal

2025 OKRs





PACO-NV-5 : Profitably scale Good Chop marketing spend towards $180m ARR by EY 2025

[bn]Hi @ferran.punet@hellofresh.com kind reminder to complete the review the otp success metrics. This will help us move to the next step of planning for making those available.

_Assigned to ferran.punet@hellofresh.com_

[bo]Hi @dvo@hellofresh.com kind reminder to complete the review the otp success metrics. This will help us move to the next step of planning for making those available.

_Assigned to dvo@hellofresh.com_

[bp]thank you for the reminder! just went through it and left a few comments/questions

[bq]HI @sameer.doda@hellofresh.ca kind reminder to complete the review the otp success metrics. This will help us move to the next step of planning for making those available.

_Assigned to sameer.doda@hellofresh.ca_

[br]What FE tracking do we need to determine if someone is an OTP prospect?

[bs]We would need to create a parameter to check if users have an otp order.

[bt]@akar@hellofresh.com I added the OTP order rate here too for visibility, we can remove / rename later. I gave it a new status with 'under review'

_Assigned to akar@hellofresh.com_

[bu]This metric could also apply for reactivations IMO

[bv]Agree

[bw]What's the reason to not combine this with the mac table but stick to the order history table? 

Also, how do we treat users that convert on a subscription but do not end up getting a box? Based on the text here I assume we ignore them but then maybe we could state that in order to graduate to a subscription the user has to have had at least one box on said subscription

[bx]Very good point on empty activations. I will add that we will only count net activations.On the other point you made the tables listed here are to indicate the otp data availability and not how exactly we will calculate the metics. So for this one indeed we can join with mac :)

[by]These metrics can already be calculated using order_line_item table

[bz]Can be calculated already!

[ca]Since it is one-time purchase so what is the point of customer lifetime value

[cb]what cadence should we send when the user selects one time box? cadence is used for subscriptions only

[cc]Hi @crui@hellofresh.com will we have the delivery handle at this stage? Or is it related to address?

[cd]@akar@hellofresh.com can you help specify all of the events we need to add the box_type parameter? We need it to implement

Meeting records Recording 





Summary

Someone in Cobbler Hill (United States-NYCHQ, 7) identified an issue where a voucher remained applied after clearing attempts, causing the plan menu to disappear upon selecting a "one time box" option, and noted a configuration discrepancy where a necessary setting was missing on live but present on staging, which also caused the wrong menu to display. Someone in Cobbler Hill (United States-NYCHQ, 7) plans to prepare the necessary work to merge the required configuration setting into the live environment today and will ask someone from the town team to review the issue.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Voucher Application and Plan Removal Issue Someone in Cobbler Hill (United States-NYCHQ, 7) observed a problem where a voucher was consistently applied, even after attempting to clear it, and found that the plan menu disappeared after clicking on a "one time box" option. They noted that the price was initially zero despite a voucher being present, and they also saw the voucher value of minus 50. Someone in Cobbler Hill (United States-NYCHQ, 7) highlighted that on staging, unlike in the current environment, the plans would typically remain available after selecting a one-time box, allowing for the voucher to be removed.

* Menu and Allocation Configuration Discrepancies Someone in Cobbler Hill (United States-NYCHQ, 7) noticed that the system was recognizing a W52 menu, but the menu still showed 'classic box free cut' instead of a GPU-specific one, indicating a potential issue with menu request or allocation. They explored whether the problem was related to CCM or a syncing issue, confirming that menus set up on live sync to staging the next day. Someone in Cobbler Hill (United States-NYCHQ, 7) then found a configuration difference: a necessary setting was present on staging but missing on live.

* Resolution Plan for Missing Configuration Someone in Cobbler Hill (United States-NYCHQ, 7) confirmed the need to merge something inside the code to resolve the configuration issue. They agreed to prepare the necessary work today to merge the required configuration setting into the live environment. Someone in Cobbler Hill (United States-NYCHQ, 7) decided to ask someone from the town team to review the issue and confirmed they would leave the matter with them.

[r]We don't have designs yet

[s]@alexander.matlin@hellofresh.com - we need to adjust the behaviour, but this depends on the number of customers impacted (if this will skew experiment results), if exposure is limited i am not confident we need to change this now.

[t]We don't show cut selection for preset plans on dashboard.

[z]YT: the header jumps between Framer and actual WL. can we make consistent?

[ag]1. See where we can minimise white space to make sure that CTA is above the fold

2. Make CTA sticky

﻿2026 Strategy

FTEs: 8 devs (3 parental fill, 2 backfills) → Q2 7 FE devs (+ 1EM +2 POs) + [new] 2 FE devs + 1 BE 

Q1: 7 FE devs (Himash, Becca, Romi, Pame, Nvard, Chi, Madeeha)

Q2: +2 FE devs, +Bolo & Richa back (11 total FEs), 1 BE (TBD)

H2 2025 Reflection

In H2 2025, our product strategy was designed to address unrecovered Conversion Rates (CR) and declining Active Order Rates (AOR). For CR, we successfully launched the Reactivation page revamp and are on progress to launch the One Time Purchase experiment. On the AOR side, we drove Free Add-on take rates to over 90% consistently by closing gaps in the selection and persistence experience, and launched Charge at Checkout.

1. Reactivation Page Revamp. We launched a new, mobile-first reactivation page that reduces the page length by one third with improvements on information architecture and clearer call to action. Also, customers can now choose their free add-ons directly on the reactivation page, instead of after reactivating their accounts. These changes are foundational to run more free for life reactivation campaigns including turkeys on Thanksgiving  (+20% CR YoY). However, some critical features were de-prioritized such as the ability to change cadence and reschedule directly on the reactivation page. 

2. One-Time Purchases (OTP). The technical solution for OTP pivoted from the initial MVP hack to the proper solution due to a technical blocker from CRM as well as higher confidence in the new endpoint following HF rollouts. While this solution saves time in the long-term, the launch week is delayed (likely W2’2026 - TBC) due to additional time for another technical investigation and (unplanned) capacity constraints.

3. Closing Free Add-on Take Rate. By October we finally reached +90% free add-on take rate for both new and active users consistently. Persisting free add-ons (+40% active TR), developing the multi-add-on pop-up on funnel and reactivation (+5% TR), and migrating bundle offers to Wallet (4.2k customers). While it’s great that we finally closed down the Wallet take rate gap, a significant portion of Q3 engineering capacity was allocated, which was not originally accounted for in the H2 roadmap.

4. Charge at Checkout. By charging customers at checkout instead of at cut-off, we aim to improve empty conversions and acceptance rates, thereby positively impacting overall delivered orders.





Learnings: 

* Better resource planning for adhoc and technical initiatives needed: We only executed on 2 out of 5 key strategies referenced in the previous strategy document with projects such as the Pricing Value Experiment getting pushed to next year. When planning for H2 2025, we did not initially account for initiatives such as Subscribable free add ons, as well as more tactical initiatives like 2-week cadence or legal compliance initiatives in the (cancellation) funnel. Engineering capacity was also impacted around September-October due to personnel changes, including one transfer to TPT and two individuals taking parental leave. We also need to proactively account for resourcing technical initiatives such as endpoint deprecations and migrations.

* More space needed for iterations: there are initiatives such as Seamless and Search with clear next iterations, however instead of building these we focused on building new initiatives. This delays implementing these learnings and therefore realization of business value. Doing these next iterations with too much time in between can also lengthen development as the team has to re-learn the technical context for the next iter

payment initiatives we should add?

[c]bnpl? :eyes:

[d]does ProcessOut unlock better capabilities (eg express checkout; bnpl)?





tbc cc @nikita.gorshkov@hellofresh.com

[e]More directly in our control: Payment failures experience in Actives experience





refer back to separate Payments discussions eg payment re-try

[f]We had discussed the delivery date picker test. Similarly, testing faster shipping to increase CVR

[g]it's here below the line

[h]plan in OTP for Actives? small lift if it's just about re-directing to a Plans page and exposing an OTP option only?

[i]if the results are positive, we'd still need significant effort to make it scalable from the data perspective. right now we'd be driving in the blind and rely on adhoc analysis, which is fine for the test but not ok for scaling marketing. basically it fully kills bob attribution based on vouchers

[j]depending on estimations we might de-prio this 





bigger upside for %-based discounts 





data on how many LL0 customers add Deals/Premium after?

[k]pre-requisite for later removing Plans page

[l]Ideally we only take this up once funnel clean up is done

[m]currently placed below the line despite bigger BC than Raf because we have already seen some improvements this year (+19% in Gross RR YoY, +14% in Net RR YoY)

[n]is it due to the new page? do we have pre/post?

[o]+ audience overlap

[p]i think this should be dependent on OTP leads results

[q]how come? I don't think the learnings from Leads test will necessarily transfer





It could work better because cancelled customers might have already experienced first-hand that subscription does not work 





We could even think about targeting specifically customers that have churned due to delivery frequency reasons

[r]-> hesitation more from a BC perspective + no ability to discount





-> refer to HF test learnings

[s]~10% cancel for "lifestyle" reason (="sub doens't work for me")

,,

,Plan,Pricing Principles at Launch

,All,Max box price should be $250 

,Fresh/Topper/Mixed,Max freezer fill is 1/3 a small NYC apt freezer

,Fresh,Aim to price lower than TFD but only if we can make PC2 margins and economics work

,All,Charge shipping separate to box price

,All,Shipping free in first order

,All,Price per day for trial is same as for regular box before discount

,All,Price per lb does not need to decrease as calories increase within same plan although it should go in that general direction

,All,"If we ship the same amount of product, the price should be the same"

,,

,Step,Description

,1: Import costs,All costs by plan imported into pricing file

,2: Benchmark,Competitors benchmarked to build up their pricing curves

,3: Scenarios,"High level pricing scenarios chosen per plan - final scenarios chosen:
- Fresh: Match TFD prices excluding shipping fee. Fresh is headline price to fix rest to
- Mixed: Should be 5-15% below Fresh depending on size and margins
- Topper: Should be 55-62.5% of Fresh price for 50% of product depending on size and margins
- Dry: Should be lowest price and price at 38% margins"

,4: Smooth pricing,Scenarios lead to choppy pricing. This was then smoothed

,5: Check PC2 / ROIs,PC2 and ROI reviewed to increase prices and improve margins where they were low

,6: Make steps,"If giving the same qty of product for 2 or more different SKUs, the prices were matched to create some stepped pricing"

,,

,,

,Type,Elements to Change in Price Test

,Architecture issue,Ensure same amount of food in box is always the same price

,Architecture issue,Review price per Lb curves i.e. price per LB should go down as calories increase

,Architecture issue,Review PC2 margins by calories within plan; and PC2 margins across calories

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Air Dried price to have lower entry price point to increase TAM

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Fresh price to be more competitive with Farmers Dog & Ollie

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Mixed price to sit in appropriate area between Fresh & Air Dried (being wary where Pantry Fresh would be)

,Architecture issue,"Lower price for larger dogs more than smaller dogs to encourage share of larger, higher ROI dogs"

Options

	Pros

	Cons

	Decision

	Launch W50

	More time before AD/ND

Time to iterate if issues

Time to rollout gradually





	Won’t make it! 

Less time for e2e testing

	No Go

	Launch W51 (To 90% of users)

	Original plan

On-track from dev pov

Captures business value earlier (~$15k in revenue)





	Super risky as most devs are out (Jordon, Jan, Edwin, Emily, Daniel, Travis)

Super close to EOY

Might break something on Factor

Not enough time for gradual rollout

On-calls: Emily Stanek (W50), Paul Andrews (W51/52)

	Maybe

	Launch W51 

(To only 10%)

	Mitigates the risk

Collects some feedback before the peak

	Still risky (Not enough devs to support)

Limited business impact





	No Go

	Launch W02

(To 90% of users)

	Less risky (Devs available for support)

Still before the actual peak

Won’t break anything on Factor/FF

	Delayed launch

Opportunity cost

### DOC:  HelloTech FAQ: HelloTech employee hub in Poland
ID: 1blbnYkSAP-T8E7E-7wDCSwei2Uj9BUIa9njDG--AdqM

﻿HelloTech FAQ: HelloTech employee hub in Poland

Employee Experience

How will this change impact me, my role, and my responsibilities?

Only roles created through natural attrition within our organization will be centralized in Poland. Adding another hub will not affect your current roles or responsibilities as we already work across multiple hubs with team members in different locations. 





Given the Hybrid working policy for SE employees and others, how should we navigate the implications of having a more physically distributed team?

The decision to open a new hub in Poland doesn’t change our stance on hybrid work—employees in Poland will follow the same 3-day in-office hybrid practices as other sites. As we do today, some employees or leaders may be required to travel between locations hosting hybrid team-building activities, and others to ensure everyone feels part of the team, regardless of their contractual workplace.





What factors are considered when choosing where to hire?

We expect to leverage natural attrition to jump-start our Poland site. The quality of talent in Poland allows us to maintain our development capacity and support critical business needs in a cost effective manner. As we have shared in other communications, we have ambitious plans for reducing Cost to Serve. Our Poland site allows us to backfill roles and enables us to deliver our Key Strategies. Berlin will continue to be the HQ of HelloTech and we will continue backfilling roles  in other Tech hubs based on business needs, talent availability, and cost considerations.

Company Strategy

What are the key business drivers for this strategic move?

Opening a presence in Wrocław is a key step in our strategy to improve efficiency, achieve sustainable success, and better meet our business goals while enhancing our capabilities. This step also helps us to  support our financial goals by backfilling roles in locations like Poland, where lower costs allow us to operate more efficiently. 





We are focused on achieving significant cost savings over the next few years, so we can invest more in our product. 

The new hub in Wrocław will not only help us meet these financial objectives but also provide access to a strong talent pool, with key skillsets, and complement our existing hubs.





How will the establishment of the Wrocław hub support our long-term business strategy beyond Tech. Have other locations been reviewed?

When evaluating opportunities, we do a comprehensive review, considering factors like location stability, talent availability, cost efficiency, growth potential, and scalability. Wrocław checks all these boxes, making it an excellent choice for long-term expansion.

Line Management

As a line manager, what can I expect from this change, and what is expected of me?

As a leader at HelloFresh, your role in driving this change is critical. Focus on building a collaborative, unified culture that works efficiently and delivers strong results. Clear and effective communication is vital, especially across sites. Ensure your team understands the context, reasoning, and how their work contributes to HelloFresh's overall success. Uphold the HelloFresh Group values, foster a positive work environment, and respect corporate policies as well as local nuances.





Lastly, when it comes to recruitment, please note that the steps of the hiring process will be BAU, however, now including Poland. If you currently have open roles or questions about recruitment in Poland, please reach out to Juliana de Carvalho Nogueira and work with your Alliance leader to determine the logistical next steps.

﻿4 customer questions

1. Who is the primary customer?  

Factor Form prospective customers who are interested in trying out the products but not interested in committing to a subscription for various reasons: 

* Want to trial products before committing to a subscription

* Prefer purchasing supplements as needed rather than on a recurring basis

* Are hesitant about subscription commitments due to past negative experiences

* Have irregular supplement consumption patterns

2. What is the customer problem or opportunity? 

Most consumers in the US still tend to approach supplement purchases with more flexibility, buying products on an as-needed basis. Nearly half of Gen Z (49%) and more than half of Millennials (53%) buy supplements when required, 58% of Gen X and 57% of Baby Boomers. 



As of today, Factor Form is only available as a subscription. As a result, we are not serving the needs of most of our target customers, or force them into a subscription only for them to cancel later on. 

13.3% of Factor Form customers cancel due to having excess product, another 9.4% cancel due to delivery frequency.





3. What is the solution? What is the customer experience? 

Every product offered on Factor Form will be available for purchase as a subscription as well as a one-time purchase. We will position subscriptions first and offer them at a lower price, as we would like to incentivize customers to stick to the habit in order to see results from the products and stay for subsequent orders. However, one-time purchase will still be available for customers who prioritize their flexibility, albeit at a higher price.

4. What is the most important customer benefit?  

The ability to buy Factor Form products without committing to a subscription or worrying about getting unwanted orders. 













PRD

[PRD] Factor Form | One-Time Purchase Option





Last updated: Jun 10, 2025

Author: Wellney Yarra

Status: Ready for stakeholder feedback and project kick off





Note: This PRD focuses on OTP for Factor Form, including more nuance and business context. For the PRD on how OTP should generally work across different brands for HelloFresh Group, refer to PRD: Enabling One-Time-Purchase (OTP) Capabilities for HelloFresh Group.





Context





Factor Form currently operates on a subscription-only model. This PRD outlines the requirements for introducing one-time purchase options to expand our total addressable market (TAM) and capture customers who prefer transactional purchases over recurring subscriptions.





The current subscription-only model creates barriers for potential customers who:

* Want to trial products before committing to a subscription

* Prefer purchasing supplements as needed rather than on a recurring basis

* Are hesitant about subscription commitments due to past negative experiences

* Have irregular supplement consumption patterns





This limitation reduces our market penetration and customer acquisition potential in the growing supplement market.





Opportunity





The global dietary supplements market is valued at over $150 billion, with over 50% of consumers preferring one-time purchases for product trials and flexibility. By offering one-time purchases, we can:

- Increase conversion rates from prospects to customers

- Capture market share from competitors offering flexible purchase options

- Generate incremental revenue from existing customers making additional purchases

- Reduce customer acquisition friction and expand our funnel





Success Metrics

* Revenue impact: 15% increase in total Factor For

[o]NOTE: couple with increased OTP purchase price of protein to $39.99

[p]requires CRM comms to active protein customers

[q]Discussion with Vitalii and Ani from Benefits:





We can likely do a CSV upload for discount setting





- some basic setup

- skus / box number / etc. can be CSV uploaded

[r]re: reactivation our team can create a discount setting and campaign for CC to use for reactivations

[s]expiration dates - unlimited is being phased out - specific date expiration or after attachment how many days can that exist





reason: legacy campaigns with no expiration can't be managed so there's more auditability - expiration can always be updated





we should still set an expiration, e.g. 2 years, and can adjust

---





SKU based -> default -> inherited (applies when we add new products) -> so what is our migration strategy when we add new products? we need to be clear on what the use cases are and ts&cs

---

POC validating our use cases so we can confirm that csv upload can do what we need

[t]Action Items





[ ] POC on staging -> csv upload for a 40% + 20% / 20% + 10% -> 52wks





[ ] Define strategy for reactivations (CC + CRM + onsite + etc)





[ ] Define strategy for new product additions (based on constraint that applied voucher won't update to new SKUs)





[ ] Define SOP for voucher maintenance -> identifying customers with a lapsed voucher / updating the duration of the discount setting on a routine basis (yearly?)

[u]updated with consolidated details:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gmUgitE31-hBHjZ8fXeJB4HCEA3szf9DzdIN4aobDOQ/edit?tab=t.ie2yvqvgmh1d#heading=h.se0i2kcyzm1t

[v]We might have to rethink the single vs double sub selector on greens

[w]Not a huge fan of putting editable stuff in cart unless absolutely necessary as this can make the cart crowded very soon. It should mostly be a product level addition, removal and summary.

[x]Update: 

1. we should handle bundles and single products in the same way when it comes to quick add, i.e. add a 2nd step where user selects OTP vs subscription on the product level

2. we don't support changing OTP vs sub on the cart for MVP

[y]IMO, anything in cart or anywhere else should also live on the PDP, which always acts as the master editor.

Dec 5, 2025 | Hamed:Nikita 1:1

Attendees: Nikita Gorshkov Hamed Karimian





Notes

* OTP Launch → decision: to have FF turn on in W02, but everything should be ready by EOY





Options

	Pros

	Cons

	Decision

	Launch W50

	More time before AD/ND

Time to iterate if issues

Time to rollout gradually





	Won’t make it! 

Less time for e2e testing

	No Go

	Launch W51 (To 90% of users)

	Original plan

On-track from dev pov

Captures business value earlier (~$15k in revenue)





	Super risky as most devs are out (Jordon, Jan, Edwin, Emily, Daniel, Travis)

Super close to EOY

Might break something on Factor

Not enough time for gradual rollout

On-calls: Emily Stanek (W50), Paul Andrews (W51/52)

	Maybe

	Launch W51 

(To only 10%)

	Mitigates the risk

Collects some feedback before the peak

	Still risky (Not enough devs to support)

Limited business impact





	No Go

	Launch W02

(To 90% of users)

	Less risky (Devs available for support)

Still before the actual peak

Won’t break anything on Factor/FF

	Delayed launch

Opportunity cost





	Go! 

	  W46 2024 - W04 2025 → The market is pretty soft over the last few weeks of the year

* Mobile app prototype

   * Who’s the owner of Factor App? → Shopping experience () & Merchandizing (Elisa Marku Laura Mneimneh)

ckable only — no code).





Recruit 10–15 representative users (existing customers or target personas).





Ask them to choose between:





Current “build-your-own” flow





The new “plan-based” flow





Ask follow-ups:





Which feels more tailored to you?





Which would you trust more?





How likely are you to purchase?





✅ Advantages: Fast qualitative signal; surfaces objections early.

💡 Tip: Use Figma Analytics or Maze metrics (time on screen, clicks) for light quant data.





Option 3: “Fake Door” Test in Live Site





Goal: Measure real interest from actual users without building full functionality.





On your live PLP or homepage, add a new section or banner:





“Introducing our new lifestyle plans — Performance, Focus, and Foundation.”

CTA: “Explore Plans.”





When users click, send them to a “Coming Soon” page or a short survey:





“We’re launching soon — tell us which plan interests you most.”





Measure clicks, plan preference, and sign-ups for early access.





✅ Advantages: True behavioral data from live traffic.

💡 Tip: Works well if your current site already gets meaningful volume.





Option 4: Email or CRM Campaign Test





Goal: Validate resonance of messaging and pricing.





Segment your customer base (athletes, busy professionals, general wellness).





Send A/B email variants — one promoting current product set, one promoting “plans.”





Measure CTR, click-to-checkout, or pre-order intent.





✅ Advantages: Zero dev time, quick pulse check on messaging effectiveness.





📊 How to Evaluate Results

Metric        Signal        Success Criteria

CTR / engagement        Do users click into plan-based offers more than product-based ones?        +15–20% vs. baseline

Intent (survey or fake door)        Are users more likely to say they’d subscribe?        Majority (>60%) positive

AOV (simulated)        When choosing a plan, is average intended spend higher?        +10–15% lift

Qualitative sentiment        Do users say the plan feels easier, more relevant, or trustworthy?        Positive pattern emerges





If 2–3 of these indicators trend positively, that’s a green light to justify design + dev investment for a live experiment.





🚀 Recommended Next Step (Low-Effort, High-Insight)





Build a simple Figma prototype with your three plans + “Choose Plan” CTA, and test it via qualitative plan. (Option 2)

----------------------------------------

﻿Scope

Scope Proposal: External Engineering Augmentation for The Pets Table (TPT)





Proposed Scope of Work & Deliverables

The augmented engineering team's scope of work will encompass the following approved initiatives. All deliverables are expected to be delivered for Web and Mobile Web, fully tested, integrated into our existing tech stack, and accompanied by necessary documentation.

New copy and assets should be editable through new contentful entries.

Priority

	High level designs 

(subject to adjustments)

	Initiative

	Customer problem & goal

	Requirements

	Is design ready for development?

	GridDynamics Briefed?

	1

	  



Multipet version (for users that have 2 or more dogs)  





	Checkout Confirmation Page 

[a]	

Post conversion, as a newly converted TPT user, I land on the “dashboard” page. Users face multiple problems: 

* They are struggling to understand that they converted

* They are finding it hard to discover and interact with features that are available to them post-checkout. 





Goal: create a page that is shown after conversion, showing an order summary and a CTA to take on one of the recommended actions: Explore the  add-on store or add another pup (depending on the version. Ie: if a user mentioned they have multiple pets in checkout show the CTA to add another pup and if they didn’t, show addons store CTA)





(Expected Impact: Increase take rate of Add-ons and Increased Retention, Increase Multipet penetration)





	* 2 versions of the checkout page are created (multipet, addons)

* The order summary is shown as per the Checkout page 

* The user is shown the right version based on their pet profile data (number of pets) 

* This initiative is more than just this page UI. There's some logic involved on how this page is loaded, which differs from our current live state, as we want to remove the “frying pan” animation[b] - currently in prod (it gives the impression that the user needs to cook the food). The right flow is laid out on Figma.

	✅ Yes.





Access Figma.





Access Prototype to see the animation in this flow.

	✅ Yes (Jun 27, 2025)

	2

	Current component:  





Goal: 

  



	Dashboard improvements - Milestone 1: 

Quick Actions on Dashboard (Above Fold Repositioning)

	Active users are not aware of the options available to them to adjust their subscription, active users are struggling to navigate to features that they need to solve their problems. 





We want to replace the current quick actions with a scalable component for subscription management, where users will be able to find the features they need on the dashboard.





(Expected Impact: Increased user engagement with core functionalities, leading to mitigating the need of churning and improved retention, as well as reduction of empty reactivations)

	* Existing quick actions (currently placed on the bottom of the page) are redesigned to be placed above the fold as an accordion[c][d][e]

* Solution is scalable and can be extended by new features in the future[f][g][h]

* The header is formatted to the new design (UI changes only)

* View order total button on mobile is changed to an icon

* CTAs are reworked as per design - we show 2 CTAs below the meals change meals and feeding guide.





	✅ Yes. Design is ready to be implemented.





Access Figma.

	✅ Yes (Jun 27, 2025)

	3

	  



	Dashboard improvements - Milestone 2: Reduced Size of Meals on Dashboard

	While the weekly menu is static, the presentation of meals takes a significant amount of TRE. 





We want to optimize the display of meal information on the cust

... [TRUNCATED: 10616 chars omitted to save context] ...

 Fresh - 750, Dry - 750, Mixed - 750

   * 50% portions: Fresh - 500, Dry - 500, Mixed - 500

   * Important note: Not all calorie ranges will have a 50% or 75% option available, for smaller dogs this might not be available

   * < 89 calories

   * Between 89-149 - offer only 100% plan for dry and fresh 

   * This is handled by the NMPS API

   * Between 150-225 - offer 100% and 75% plan for dry and fresh

   * 226+ - offer mixed plan + 50% 75% and 100% percentages for dry and fresh

   * This has to be implemented in the FE because the API returns mixed plan for 50/75% portions





Switching the user’s portion percentage requires 2 API calls:

   * Patch the user’s subscription to update their plan - This is what’s actually responsible for changing the amount of food user’s get

   * Patch the pet profile to update the `portionPercentage` field - This field doesn’t have any direct impact on the user’s plan size, but it’s used to be able to identify these users as well as communicate to them what portion they’re feeding. 

   * This is necessary because the plan alone isn’t enough since the same plan could be a 100% portion for another dog (E.g. Fresh 500 calories could be a 50% portion for a big dog but 100% portion for a small dog)





Important components:

   * Portion % hook

   * Portion % badge

   * Quiz Steps

   * Quiz Allergens experiment setup - This is an old experiment that had the same setup as we want for this, we should repurpose this for the new experiment

Hi Nikita,



Your customers aren't searching the way they used to.



VOIS and Vodafone UK are seeing this firsthand: AI-assisted searches jumped 9x in 12 months. Zero-click searches surged 13 points. When AI summaries appear in results, click-throughs drop 79%.



Translation: marketing playbooks need an update — fast.



VOIS and Vodafone UK aren't debating AI strategy anymore. They're already seeing results (https://go.writer.com/e3t/Ctc/RL+113/d4QBTl04/VW_sSJ7RgcnmN3PF8PsJWQ1YW8QwHkG5HbYXYN56dXjb3prCCW8wLKSR6lZ3mhW6FLsxf9kc350W4SLzlf48tfNpN6S6Y0x2LYp_W2s_bHW1flq2CVnrvRb37c5nHW4gCN_545bN3kW1ysGcN8tFL9YW5lK5fv3Gffm_VxTNn82jP_GCW8NvYSJ77z-dkW67ylnG1Q9QtpW6FYr561MWB9dW5dPcWn7MTT_2W15wfd45Fgw3gW21f-8K6p5dH2W5xN1T11hH47PW5vW3xc6Br4xQN5p3j7VK2V-hW7x5Wwy3ldSnNN7WV4yqbyjmMW36fkRY9gBWMBW5_KrHQ6lS4m5W1VyxGp1BF7tXW8rd7ZC4c4f3XW26ZQZY5RtmH4W67DsPS2W7JbzW5nwMSZ4TDWHLW5PHJrQ64C_RbdDC6vx04 ) : campaign executi

Summary



Someone in Cobbler Hill (United States-NYCHQ, 7) identified an issue where  

a voucher remained applied after clearing attempts, causing the plan menu  

to disappear upon selecting a "one time box" option, and noted a  

configuration discrepancy where a necessary setting was missing on live but  

present on staging, which also caused the wrong menu to display. Someone in  

Cobbler Hill (United States-NYCHQ, 7) plans to prepare the necessary work  

to merge the required configuration setting into the live environment today  

and will ask someone from the town team to review the issue.

Hi Nirav,

Wanted to introduce you to Ian Brooks - our Canada CEO, who is looking to launch

a pilot program for Factor B2B in Canada. As far as I know Annatta was also

providing the services for Factor US B2B; so has the context in that space and

seemed like a natural fit to expand a paired down version to Canada.



Could you tell us when would be a good time to call?

Based on hundreds of tests conducted with UserTesting, the Wells Fargo team was able to create a Visual Appeal Index. This allowed them to rank exactly what type of visual elements were going to perform the best in the app, at any given time.

Summary



The team, including Shishir Mishra and Michael Lucero, discussed the target  

process for pre-cut off order cancellations and refunds via the AL system,  

with Shishir Mishra confirming the ideal process is to mark the order  

as "not shipped" and cancel the payment, a process known to agents.  

Gangadharan Khoteeswarun (Ganga) identified a bug in the payments domain,  

affecting automatic refund reconciliation for CNC orders and partially paid  

orders using process out, which means refunds only occur after the cut off,  

and stated that a fix is being tested for deployment to production soon.  

Participants including someone in Lower Feast Side (United States-NYCHQ,  

7), Shishir Mishra, and Hagag discussed agent processes, clarifying that  

cancellations do not happen via ART, and also addressed the confusion  

surrounding payment status and refund visibility for CNC orders before and  

after cutoff.





Suggested next steps





Someone in Lower Feast Side (United States-NYCHQ, 7) will try another one  

and follow the same steps to see that the identifiers are clear once the  

bug fix is pushed.

Ian - would love to hop on a call with you. We are indeed providing the solution

for Kiran and his team on the B2B side. I will make sure to loop in that

specific team as well into our conversations. What is your schedule like

tomorrow or Friday?

Hi Nirav,

Wanted to introduce you to Ian Brooks - our Canada CEO, who is looking to launch

a pilot program for Factor B2B in Canada. As far as I know Annatta was also

providing the services for Factor US B2B; so has the context in that space and

seemed like a natural fit to expand a paired down version to Canada.



Could you tell us when would be a good time to call?

Summary



Ian Brooks initiated a discussion about launching a Shopify store in Canada  

to block out competition, with planned resources for March from Ian Brooks  

and Kevin to handle sales. Nikita Gorshkov detailed resource constraints  

due to the GC Netherlands migration blocking the implementation team until  

February, making a "lift and shift" of the US B2B Shopify store setup using  

Anata the most straightforward approach. Ian Brooks confirmed that a  

minimal integration pilot, focusing on a simple storefront and data output  

without SCM integrations for small volumes, would be sufficient to proceed,  

and Nikita Gorshkov noted that existing contracts with the US entity for  

factor, covering Shopify and Anata, would likely allow the Canadian  

business to piggyback on them.





Suggested next steps





Nikita Gorshkov will check in with Samir regarding the Shopify store setup  

and get back to Ian Brooks by Friday.



Nikita Gorshkov will talk with Ally today so she can start digging into the  

details.



Nikita Gorshkov will introduce Ian Brooks to Nurev to get a price quote  

from the agency for the needed work.



Nikita Gorshkov will ping Anata to check the cost of their services.
