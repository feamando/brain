Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Jenna O'Shea and Nikita Gorshkov discussed the immediate need to hire a mid-level designer for the Good Chop replacement position, with Jenna O'Shea preferring a mid-level role for long-term growth and Nikita Gorshkov emphasizing the candidate's need to be systematic. Regarding team management, Jenna O'Shea committed to being more hands-on and coaching Mega on stakeholder management, while they also decided to bundle design critiques for New Ventures and Shopping to promote knowledge transfer and suggested involving Nikita Gorshkov or Daniel in the hiring interviews. They also discussed Nikita Gorshkov’s concern over the VMS Shopify store's templated design and "lack of ownership," and established the Factor Form strategy of integrating it into Factor if the Shopify store fails.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Initial Check-in and AI Context Jenna O'Shea and Nikita Gorshkov started the meeting with a brief check-in, where Jenna O'Shea apologized for not accessing the AI pre-read due to connection issues at their new place. Nikita Gorshkov reassured them that the AI's current pre-reads may not be 100% accurate yet because it lacks past context, comparing it to a "baby Nikita" that is still learning and will become more accurate over time (00:00:00).

* Personal Update on Baby's Sleep Nikita Gorshkov shared positive news that they had managed to sleep at the same time as their baby during their shift for two consecutive days. They explained that the baby had initially refused to sleep on any flat surface, despite advice, but they found success with co-sleeping, with the baby taking "center stage" in the bed (00:01:05). Jenna O'Shea congratulated them, emphasizing that what works for their family is what matters, as not "everything is textbook" (00:02:11).

* Hiring Strategy for Good Chop Position Jenna O'Shea identified the key topic as hiring a replacement for David, and specifically, opening a mid-level position for Good Chop as soon as possible, with an intention to open it in January (00:02:11). Jenna O'Shea expressed a preference for hiring a mid-level designer to allow for long-term growth and avoid the cycle of quickly hiring and losing momentum with senior roles, given the team's seniority and the nature of the design work in that space (00:03:16).

* Team Strength and Management Strategy Jenna O'Shea observed that the design team is "really solid" and demonstrated a strong community, citing an example of Marina onboarding Shay onto tasks despite Katrina and Pedro being out, which Jenna O'Shea identified as a leadership issue. Jenna O'Shea is committed to being more hands-on to address "Yuri level frustrations," and intends to coach Mega on stakeholder management once they return in August (00:04:06). Nikita Gorshkov agreed with the mid-level hiring but emphasized the importance of the candidate being systematic in their work to avoid the previous problem of constantly designing new components instead of reusing existing ones (00:06:17).

* Recommendations for Design Collaboration and Hiring Process To ensure a systematic approach, Jenna O'Shea recommended bundling design critiques for New Ventures and Shopping together, anticipating "healthy friction" and knowledge transfer between the system-focused HelloFresh side and the more explorative New Ventures side. Regarding the hiring process for the mid-level role, Jenna O'Shea suggested involving Nikita Gorshkov or Daniel

Nikita Gorshkov: Um and then yeah with TPT honestly we have Katrina and I'm very happy with Katrina's work so far. So so far so good there. Uh, I think that's less of a prevalence. And then, yeah, uh, I'm gonna ping Shay to maybe ping you and also, you know, do a demo and things like that. What we need to solve for our factor forum subbrands are UX issues. And I think if you I don't know if you already went through some of the experiences and the funnel and things like that on factor forum. Um, but if you haven't, please do. That would be super helpful because I think you'll see what I'm talking about when me and Hamemed are saying that we need to fix the UX

Jenna O'Shea: Um,

Nikita Gorshkov: there.

Jenna O'Shea: so I already asked Michael, who's on factor form as point of contact, to go ahead and do an audit on that for us,

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah.

Jenna O'Shea: like a UX audit.

Nikita Gorshkov: Oh, yeah. Michael, sorry. Sorry, that was a mixup.

 

 

00:15:23

 

Nikita Gorshkov: Michael.

Jenna O'Shea: Yeah. So, I mean, uh,

Nikita Gorshkov: Yep.

Jenna O'Shea: feel free to to put Yumi and Michael into a conversation and like just kind of like a closing the loop kind of statement because that is really what I would expect him to do next. He said that he had done a UX audit for factor form when he started, but then this was spinning up la. Um, so let's actually have him put that effort into this because it sounds like he has a really big appetite to be a key voice in strategy and experience experience strategy here. also seems like he's pretty experienced, so let's leverage

Nikita Gorshkov: Nice. Perfect.

Jenna O'Shea: Sweet. Okay, I have nothing urgent from my side other than like I'm still newbie, still on boarding. If there's anything I'm getting wrong or anything I need to be learning while I'm being loud in these rooms, please let me know. If there are any other rooms that I'm supposed to be in that I'm not, please let me know. From a design perspective, you'll have a little bit more visibility over who's doing what uh than before. Uh cuz I realized that the new brand's Jira board is the one that I set up sometime around 2019 2020.

Nikita Gorshkov: Thanks. Awesome.

﻿📝 Project Setup

Influencer Marketplace: Strategy

	‘Recipe Creator’ Marketplace

	Current Phase

	3. Prototype & Validate: MVP Blueprint

	Current Sprint

	Sprint 4, week 1

Problem Statement

Social media has become a primary hub for culinary inspiration, where people turn to influencers to discover new recipes. While Followers struggle to find the necessary ingredients and an easy way to re-cook them, Influencers look for new revenue streams to be more independent from the heavily controlled platforms and find new ways to expand their reach and engage with their audiences authentically and organically via food.





Opportunity:

Hellofresh sees a huge opportunity to serve both: by transforming influencers' inspiration (recipe) into a shoppable, cookable meal kit for the consumers. 

By bridging the gap as the Expert in operation, warehouses and logistics, we provide customers a way to enjoy these recipes easily and the influencer to serve their followers and create a new revenue stream. The social commerce market is growing rapidly and can represent a huge opportunity for us to attract new customers.





Why now:

We see the urgency to act now, because influencers are already trying to solve this problem with links to ingredient orders  via Instacart or Pinterest partners with Instacart to enable 1-click grocery list generation from saved pins. But today, shoppable content on social media within the food category is often limited to individual food items as opposed to a holistic offering where the ingredients for entire recipes and direct delivery can be purchased. 





The Core Ask 

WBD: Influencer Marketplace

Explore desired and viable vision for a curated recipe creator marketplace (1. influencer, 2. Aggregators) with the option of an  instant purchase as a meal kit ‘fulfilled by HelloFresh’.





Long-term Vision (Later) 

Transform HelloFresh into the “Spotify for food”  a platform where any creator can share a recipe that HelloFresh fulfills.

﻿Research Results

Executive Summary: 

Research participants responded very positively to the Influencer Marketplace concept, viewing it as a compelling way to turn social media food inspiration into achievable home cooking. The concept resonates because it directly addresses two major friction points: difficulty sourcing niche ingredients, due to cost, waste, and effort, and the common habit of saving recipes that are later forgotten in overcrowded digital collections.

Trust in recipes is driven less by influencer status[a] and more by practical signals of feasibility, including strong visuals, clear instructions, and access to the original social media content for verification. Participants place significant responsibility on HelloFresh to ensure recipe quality, either through internal testing and approval or, if full vetting is not feasible, through transparent and prominent community ratings and reviews.

The marketplace is perceived primarily as an occasion-based solution rather than a replacement for everyday meal planning. Participants most strongly associate it with dinner and special occasions such as weekends or hosting, with limited interest in breakfast or lunch use cases. To encourage trial and adoption, users strongly prefer a low-commitment purchasing model, favoring one-time purchases over subscription requirements.[b]

Discovery expectations are food-first rather than creator-led, with users wanting to browse and search by ingredient or cuisine instead of influencer names. Finally, participants expressed a need for more robust recipe management tools, including custom organization and scheduling features, to ensure saved recipes resurface at the right time and translate into actual cooking behavior.

Recommendations:

Topic

	Concern

	Recommendation

	Building Creator Trust

	In this marketplace, users may find it challenging to evaluate creators in the same ways they do on social media. 

	* Direct Links to Original Videos: To foster greater trust in creators, half of participants (4 out of 8) suggested the inclusion of direct links on recipe pages. These links should lead back to the influencer's original social media video, providing direct visual instruction and making it simpler for users to verify and find their content.

	Recipe Vetting

	Participants generally expressed skepticism about recipe reliability from unverified creators, with the majority expecting HelloFresh to act as a "safety net" by vetting recipes for safety and feasibility. Without HelloFresh vetting all recipes, users need to be able to have the information to evaluate the recipes themselves.

	* Verified Badge: If HelloFresh chooses to quality test any of the recipes, a visual distinction like a tag or a badge should indicate which recipes have been tested by HelloFresh chefs, in contrast to unverified user-uploaded content.

* Unfiltered Reviews: Users desire a transparent review system that includes recipe ratings, customer feedback, and photos. This system should allow users to view any negative feedback or potential issues, helping them determine the trustworthiness of a recipe creator. 

* Recipe Comments or Q&A: Participants indicated a need for a comment or Q&A section, separate from a typical review system. This feature would allow them to see and address challenges or questions raised by other users before they begin cooking, increasing their confidence in the recipe's quality and preparedness.

      * Evidence: "Being able to just organize them and group them together... having like a section, like, I really want to try this... filter them like, okay, these are my top ones" .

Creator Link-Outs

      * What she wants: Links on the recipe page that go directly to the creator's social media video (TikTok/YouTube).

      * Why she recommends it: She wants to see the visual proof of the recipe being made.

      * Evidence: "You can click on it and it takes you to their TikTok of the recipe... being able to see a short video of someone, like creating something that really helps"

[a]@katheryn.eckles@hellofresh.com this is interesting, I feel in the food bubble, people follow mainly for content and less because they like the person/brand

[b]What we need to figure out here is: Whats the actual value the marketplace provides to the user? If its not the influencers, why are we not just going for a OTP in HF instead?

[c]this is an argument toward my previous comment, but this would be the perfect result, to find every recipe online in hf marketplace as a purchasable option

[d]Create clip, main barrier to cooking influencer recipes

[e]Video: Include clips of those assuming HF responsibility, splitting the responsibility, and those around ratings/reviews.

[n]we had this idea in our miroboard as well

[o]@linnea.siersma@hellofresh.ca @cole@hellofresh.ca this is an interesting idea

[p]Epicurious commentary on recipes is hugely valuable; this makes sense to me

[q]@linnea.siersma@hellofresh.ca

[r]I think we can solve this issue with digital curation // personalization. But probably also good to have a clean-up if a recipe gets no engagement for a long period of time.

Accessibility-2025 Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Accessibility-2025 Program,,,,,,,,,,Recent action Items,,,,,,

,Welcome! The Accessibility-2025 Program will enable HelloFresh Group to complete HelloTech Objective #4 and comply with the modern level of accessibility for our customers driven by The European Accessibility Act (EAA). The program has two goals:,,,,,,,,,,🔄,"Resolve 90% of the P1 issues identified through Cypress that break 11 WCAG rules and manual audits in WEB.
Deadline: December 31st.",,,,,

,1,"Reduce the number of ""important"" Accessibility issues in HelloFresh, GreenChef, and Factor by 90% in WEB experiences by 28 June 2025, and in Mobile experiences by 31 Dec 2025.",,,,,,,,,🔄,"Resolve 90% of the P0 issues identified through Cypress that break 4 WCAG rules and manual audits in REACT NATIVE.
Deadline: December 31st.",,,,,

,2,Establish accessibility standards to support future HelloTech product development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Current P90 compliance,,,,,,source

,Background,,,,,,,,,,WEB,,,,MOBILE,,

,"The European Accessibility Act (EAA), which mandates that websites and mobile applications comply with WCAG 2.2 Level AA accessibility standards, will come into effect on June 28, 2025. The directive applies to all businesses in the EU, including HelloFresh. Non-compliance can result in penalties such as fines (ranging from 500–500k€) or, in some countries like Ireland, even prison sentences. Companies may also face legal action from disability advocacy groups.",,,,,,,,,,35%,,,,15%,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Remediating the risk of fines requires a company-wide collaboration, which is the background of launching this program. Apart from avoiding fines, improved Accessibility in our interfaces also gives us access to new potential customers (with disposable income) who previously may not have considered our product because they functionally were prevented from doing so. There is no calculated business case for the Group yet, but we plan to dig deeper into the opportunity in H2. The program will be driven by Foundations Alliance and involve all CFAs teams owning Front End TRE in mobile or web.",,,,,,,,,,2025 compliance target,,,,,,source

,,,,,,,,,,,WEB,,,,MOBILE,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Foundations Alliance made all Zest components compliant with EAA standards out of the box, however, this does not guarantee full compliance. To achieve full compliance by June 2025, all CFAs will review their journeys and modify them as needed. 

Foundations Alliance has provided the following inputs to enable CFAs to minimize their efforts:",,,,,,,,,,53%,,,,20%,,

﻿Interview: Cheatdayeats

Influencer: Jessica Hirsch of Cheatdayeats

Main Socials: Instagram, Tiktok

Following Size: Instagram 559K, Tiktok: 114K

Content focus: Comfort food with with interesting twists and formats

Interview Date: Nov. 14, 2025

Part 1: Creator Background

* Primary Goal: Her main goal is building a strong community and establishing trust with her followers. She wants her content to be accessible, fun, and easy, focusing on recipes that are not overly complex (e.g., 5 ingredients, 15 minutes).

* Content & Platforms: Her content has evolved from featuring restaurants to focusing on her own recipes.

   * Her main platforms are Instagram and TikTok, but she is also building on YouTube, Facebook, and Threads.

   * She noted that her Instagram audience feels more like a "hardcore" community, while TikTok feels more random and driven by the "For You" page.

   * She tailors content, finding that TikTok performs better with longer, descriptive videos, whereas Instagram favors short, quick videos.

* Workflow & Tools: She works as a two-person team with her husband. He assists with filming and emails, while she handles most of the editing and community engagement. She uses Capcut and Premiere Pro for editing.

* Monetization: Her income is primarily from brand deals and creating UGC (User-Generated Content) for brands. She makes some money from the TikTok fund but finds the monetization rules across platforms to be confusing and hard to keep up with.

* Biggest Challenges:

   * The Algorithm: Her single biggest challenge is connecting with her audience due to the "ebb and flow" of platform algorithms. She struggles to know if low engagement is due to her content or the algorithm simply not showing it to her followers.

   * Time & Trends: As a small team, she finds it challenging to be consistent and invest time across all platforms. If she could delegate one task, it would be keeping up with all the different platform-specific trends, audios, and algorithm changes.

________________





Part 2: The HelloFresh Concept & Feedback

Value Proposition

* Her initial concern was cost and timeliness versus just using Instacart.

* However, she quickly saw the value in providing exact, pre-portioned ingredients, noting she has also bought an expensive spice just to use it once.

* She felt the concept would be especially powerful for recipes involving unique, expensive, or hard-to-find ingredients, like pistachio paste for the viral Dubai chocolate trend.

Ingredient Strategy & Value

The core value for users will come from the ingredients. Jessica stressed that the program must:

* Focus on Unique/Specialty Items: The program's biggest draw would be providing ingredients that are hard to find, expensive, or unique. This creates a clear value-add over a user just going to their local supermarket.

* Highlight Pre-Portioned Savings: The program should emphasize the value of providing exact portions of expensive ingredients (like saffron or pistachio paste) so the user doesn't have to buy a large, costly jar for a single recipe.

* Ensure High-Quality Ingredients: Jessica was very clear that the quality of the ingredients is critical. She noted that for recipes with few ingredients, the quality matters a lot (e.g., "which sharp cheddar" is being used).

Creator-Follower Connection

The program must be designed to enhance, not just use, the creator's existing community.

* Create a "Full Circle" Loop: Jessica suggested including a QR code or link in the box that directs the user back to the creator's original post, website, or

ds to be a minimum number of recipes to start with for the offering to look meaningful

[f]While this is possible in the beginning when we are handholding recipe creation, in the long run this can become a scalability issue. I am curious, though what did she mean by vetting?

[g]I don't expect we would do this

[h]In the second interview, we also saw an assumption that we would pay for the effort to upload a recipe. If it comes up in the session today, I can dig into that a bit more and understand their perspective on that kind of pre-sales payment not being provided.

[i]Thanks. I think the idea of what we want to convey is that the more they get their followers to order the recipes, they more they earn.

[j]This is earning for outputs, not paying for inputs

[k]@katheryn.eckles@hellofresh.com - do we know for amazon storefront if amazon is paying any of the creators for the content or only based on commission?

[l]From all of the documentation around the amazon storefront that I have found, it looks like it is only based on commission. In future interviews I can probe into their experience with the amazon storefront though and see if there are any other experiences with it. And see how they feel about this program's compensation being structured like the Amazon storefront.

[m]Note that this is different from the expected payout method of the prior two participants who wanted an initial incentive for uploading/posting about the recipe, and commission on sales.

[n]With Kay I dove a little deeper into how her brand deals work to answer some of the questions around this that came up in our sync this week.

[o]Suggestion: For onboarding influencers to this program, a base fee might be the best route for early creators who have no evidence of what this may look like. Once we get enough data to provide examples and estimates, creators may be more comfortable investing time to see if it will work for them.

[p]If this would be a menu to choose from, yes, but for now the creator becomes the storefront so I dont see this as a problem

"How it works

This sheet provides the percentage of operational overhead (i.e. KTLO work per month). Each team has a dedicated tab. For this to work, you need to
* add the label KTLO to all Jira tickets that you consider KTLO work
* Make sure all tickets that move into the “resolved” state have assigned story points. Add the actual story point in hindsight for accurate operational overhead calculation
A cron job runs every night and updates this sheet. It used the resolved date to include a ticket in the calculation for a specific month.

﻿🚧 Overview





Good Chop - Shopify Storefront

	Created At: Oct 27, 2025

	Last Updated: Nov 12, 2025

	Status: In Progress

	Author: Alison Ryan

	



Summary

This document outlines the approach and implementation strategy for to experiment with item-based pricing for Good Chop. This experiment will create a Shopify storefront to offer products through both one-time purchases and flexible subscriptions.

The primary objective is to create an new marketplace for Good Chop customers to order products in a flexible way that fit additional needs. With the marketplace, we hope to gain insights into how product uptake, order habits, customer lifetime value, and impact on subscription retention differ than the existing experience. We will also evaluate the operational lift and cost-effectiveness of this new channel.

Strategy Review

Good Chop is launching a new marketplace experience built on Shopify to offer customers flexible ordering, such as one-time purchases and item-based pricing. The test will help us get quick learnings and build confidence on initiatives not easily testable in our current tech infrastructure, such as item-based pricing. Furthermore it will focus on targeting customers entering specific channels (eg via SEM when prospects search for specific cuts).

* Phase 1: Launch with item-based pricing and a traditional e-commerce experience to establish baseline performance metrics. 

* Phase 2: Introduce a "subscriptions + save" option and compare its performance against both OTP and the current subscription model.

* Phase 3: Scope and goals will be determined based on the comprehensive results from Phases 1 and 2.

Implementation will be handled in partnership with an external team (Anatta) ensuring a streamlined and rapid setup of the Shopify marketplace.

Success will be evaluated based on core metrics, including CAC, CVR and AOR. We will also track user journey analysis, CLV and product uptake to identify any performance differences for specific protein cuts in an e-commerce context. The assessment of this new channel will focus on its operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.









What is the problem we’re trying to solve?





What is the solution?



Who is the target customer? What will customer experience be?[a]

* The primary focus for this Shopify Storefront is to capture new customers whose profiles align with the established Good Chop customer personas.

* However, the scope is not exclusively limited to entirely new customers. We recognize the value of driving traffic and potential conversions from a broader audience. Therefore, we will not restrict access or promotional offers to customers who may already have an existing account, a currently active subscription, or a past subscription history with Good Chop.

* The strategy is to leverage the new storefront experience to:

1. Acquire New Customers: Specifically target individuals identified by our marketing segmentation as being an ideal fit for the Good Chop brand and product offering.

2. Re-engage Former/Existing Customers: Allow existing or previous subscribers to easily interact with the new storefront, potentially leading to new, additional, or reactivated subscriptions.

This inclusive approach ensures we maximize the reach and impact of the new Shopify storefront across the entire potential customer spectrum while remaining focused on the core objective of new customer acquisition.





Customers have the ability to maintain their current account / subscrtioins experience today, as well as explore and order from the Shopfiy marketplace.

sting Factor Customers)

* Primary Focus: Synergy & Convenience.

   * Tone: Familiar, convenient, value-add, and focused on integration with existing routines.

   * Core Message: Complete your routine. Factor Form supplements are designed to perfectly complement your weekly Factor meals and optimize your wellness goals.

   * Key Value Props: "Add to your existing subscription," "Checkout in one click," "Formulated to pair with our meal plans."

C. Brand Alignment

The visual identity (logos, colors, fonts) must be identical across both platforms to maintain a single, cohesive Factor Form brand, regardless of the user's entry point. The only distinction should be the functionality and the audience-specific messaging.





4. Data Strategy

The goal is to establish a single, unified source of truth for Factor Form performance data while avoiding direct integration with existing HelloFresh dashboards to minimize integration complexity and alignment overhead.

Data type 

	Approach

	Financial performance

	 Will be aggregated manually (by downloading Shopify reports and summing them with Factor data).

	Usage tracking

	For MVP, we will support a simple GTM install. More advanced usage tracking will be done directly on Shopify or Shopify plugins

	Experimentation

	No integration with Statsig. Any A/B test will be run and analyzed directly on Shopify or Shopify plugins

	User feedback

	Since HelloFresh uses Sprig but Sprig is not on Shopify, any customer feedback needs will be managed directly on Shopify or through Shopify plugins

	Product ratings and reviews

	Handled through 3rd party Shopify plugin, yotpo.com 

	











[a]@sameer.doda@hellofresh.ca this whole section was written oct, when we yet aligned on excluding traffic between sites. We will need to edit, to reflect out recommendation to exclude or not. 





This is a open question for Yury to decide on, so we need to showcase both options.

[b]We dont have a STRICT timeline

We want to go live in Q1

Launch in March, to get insights before Q2

At Minimum 2 weeks, for campaigns to have an insight into performance

[c]not sure how this works or what we use for GoodChop today...

[d]elevar?

[e]will need alignment with Nikita

[f]pulled from email with Nikita. Needs work / clarity.

[g]Will need support from Yury / team to confirm this

[h]TBD with alignment from Yury / team

[i]this maintains?

[q]@alexander.matlin@hellofresh.com share designs with Yury

[r]We don't have designs yet

[s]@alexander.matlin@hellofresh.com - we need to adjust the behaviour, but this depends on the number of customers impacted (if this will skew experiment results), if exposure is limited i am not confident we need to change this now.

[t]We don't show cut selection for preset plans on dashboard.

[z]YT: the header jumps between Framer and actual WL. can we make consistent?

[aa]can we condense the spacing so that each sections CTA

[ab]YT: could we make content pages more visible on Mobile

[ac]Takeaways: 1. don't show cut details 2. have multivariate test 3. optimise on pc2 4. customers can move to custom whether it's a. on dashboard or b. on plan settings -> depends on effort

2. Make CTA sticky

Connect on CA B2B Shopify Integration

Invited Nikita Gorshkov Elysa Viti

Attachments Connect on CA B2B Shopify Integration 

Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Elysa Viti initiated a discussion with Nikita Gorshkov about the Canadian B2B site, which requires Shopify as middleware because no current systems, except Katana, support the necessary B2B functionality out of the box; the site aims to automate small business employee orders (Factor only), which are currently manual and error-prone. Nikita Gorshkov emphasized that the success of B2B depends on a strong sales presence, and confirmed that zero people are currently allocated to B2B development, with expectations that a dedicated B2B team may be pushed for around June, leading Elysa Viti to estimate a Q3 launch for the Shopify integration. The strategy for the first half of the year involves manually testing streams like sports teams and gyms, and Elysa Viti suggested a separate team should handle B2B.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Initial Scope and Technical Challenges for B2B in Canada Elysa Viti initiated the discussion to scope the work required for a B2B site in Canada, noting it seemed to involve more work than initially expected (00:00:00). Nikita Gorshkov explained the complexities, emphasizing that none of their current systems, except for Katana, support the required B2B functionality out of the box, necessitating the use of Shopify as a middleware solution for consolidation (00:03:20). They also detailed the need for extensive integration with retailers or businesses for order placement, inventory management, and the requirement for a CRM system, mentioning a possible transition to HubSpot (00:04:29).

* Sales Presence and Commercial Support for B2B Nikita Gorshkov stressed that the success of B2B, particularly for physical goods, heavily relies not on tech, but on a strong sales presence and field team to build relationships (00:04:29). Elysa Viti noted that the Canadian B2B initiative involves only them and their direct report, and they will not be doing fieldwork (00:05:38). Elysa Viti clarified that the main purpose of the Canadian B2B site is to facilitate small businesses placing orders for their employees (Factor only, not HelloFresh), with a current manual ordering system leading to errors and requiring a Shopify integration to automate the process. They do not foresee using it for retail immediately, aiming to unlock small businesses first (00:06:51).

* Timeline and Resource Allocation for B2B Development Elysa Viti plans to discuss the business case with Kieran to adapt it for Canada and determine a timeline for integration (00:07:55). Nikita Gorshkov revealed that there are currently zero people allocated to B2B within their funding, and they anticipate that Adam and Factor, along with Ed, may push for a dedicated B2B team around June (00:08:58). This timeline suggests that dedicated work on the B2B site would likely start in June. Elysa Viti estimated that the development, which they suggested might take about a month since it's based on the US system, means a realistic launch for the Shopify integration would be in Q3 (00:09:56) (00:13:46).

* Strategy and Team Structure for Canadian B2B Elysa Viti described their strategy for the first half of the year (until June), which includes manually testing streams like sports teams, gyms, and private retail locations (e.g., universities) (00:12:58). Elysa Viti expressed concern about managing both growth and revenue and suggested a separate team should handle B2B, similar

lready told you know our I don't know if you know Kevin he's our um our I think he's what's his title? What is Kevin's title? Hold on. Um I think he is he's a DM for Factor Canada. He's basically online.

Nikita Gorshkov: Uh, okay.

Elysa Viti: He's online.

Nikita Gorshkov: Okay.

Elysa Viti: He He's good with us testing out a few things until we get this Shopify integration going. So I'm just going to give him the timeline that you know we don't have a dedicated team to this right now who will be able to support in the first half of the year getting this online. So we're looking at it'll the work will start in June not finish it like this is this is K is submitted JAMA or the team takes it away I don't

Nikita Gorshkov: H.

Elysa Viti: know once you guys have it three four weeks I don't know how long it might take like a month

Nikita Gorshkov: Huh?

Elysa Viti: or so I'm guessing um because it's really just the same system as that exists in the US just copy paste for Canada I'm saying copy paste but I know it's not that easy

 

 

00:14:52

 

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah. Yeah. It's It never is.

Elysa Viti: u a version of that.

Nikita Gorshkov: It never is.

Elysa Viti: Um, so about a month after,

Nikita Gorshkov: Right.

Elysa Viti: so we're looking at realistically Q3.

Nikita Gorshkov: Okay.

Elysa Viti: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: I think that's I think that's okay.

Elysa Viti: Okay. Okay.

Nikita Gorshkov: I mean,

Elysa Viti: Got it.

Nikita Gorshkov: it's not unreasonable.

Elysa Viti: All right.

Nikita Gorshkov: There we go.

Elysa Viti: Yeah. Yeah. This is a lot of work um for both you and I at this point. So, I just need to set realistic expectations with SLT that, you know, we don't have the resources. Things can't get done as fast as they would like. We need more people. Yeah. Okay. All right.

Nikita Gorshkov: Nice.

Elysa Viti: I think um I think that's it for now from me. Um I'm going to forward all these notes over to Kevin to Cole, our director of growth,

Nikita Gorshkov: Mhm.

Elysa Viti: just for him to, you know, they can read up on it. If they have any questions, I'll let you know. But for now, I think we're okay. Okay. Thank you. And I'll keep you posted on income.

🛣️ Q2+Q3 Roadmap

Solenne, Ahmed, Tobias and I sat down and put our planned projects into a roadmap for Q2 and Q3. Tobias and Solenne presented this roadmap to Yoav and Annie and received good feedback about it. In the second tab of the spreadsheet we listed the priorities, with Porterhouse leading the list. Whenever we have to make a hard choice between two deliveries, we will decide for the one with the higher priority. That makes projects with lower priority more likely to be delayed than the ones with higher priority. If you have any concern of a high-priority project, please let Tobias and Solenne know as soon as possible.

💻 Tech Initiatives

                                                                                                                                    * The BFF migration in the mobile app is almost almost almost complete. We can expect the initiative to be complete early next week. There are still some cleaning up to do on web and mobile.

                                                                                                                                    * Last week we implemented a proof of concept of how we can migrate route access control to react components, and this we started with the migration of the access control function for the Cancellation page. By the end of next week, we should have also migrated the Delivery Tracking and RaF routes.

💸 Additional Vouchers

One of Engagement's sprint goals is to support Additional Vouchers in our price calculation logic for web and mobile. This week we started working on the website, refactoring the voucher Redux logic (🍝) and implementing the action to fetch a subscription's additional voucher info.

🔪 Killing Alice

This week we removed the last API call to Alice: update payment method in web. Before Alice is really killed in Intfood (expected mid April), we will need to do a force update of our mobile app to prevent users from using old versions that are still using the old endpoints.

🛒 Add-ons

The Happiness team started to implement some changes for Add-Ons, and was able to setup some add-ons SKUs in staging.

Summary

Mario Konschake and Nikita Gorshkov discussed the definition and rollout of the AI-native Product Development Lifecycle (PDLC), with Mario Konschake expressing concern that product management will become a bottleneck as engineering and UX speed up without proper support for providing fast and better context. Nikita Gorshkov introduced their concept of context-driven product management, detailing a custom automated system that curates a knowledge base of entities and relationships to improve generative AI output, but raised concerns about scaling this approach due to the lack of consolidated infrastructure and the "nightmare" of locating the correct version of institutional knowledge across disparate tools. The participants compared AI models, with Nikita Gorshkov preferring Gemini over Claude for general text and deep research, and they agreed that high-value AI capabilities for product managers lie in data discovery and analysis—specifically, using CLI tools to quickly analyze data and identify optimization opportunities.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Golden Path for AI-Native PDLC and Product Management Bottlenecks Mario Konschake is working with PEP to define and roll out the golden path for an AI-native Product Development Lifecycle (PDLC) (00:00:00). Mario Konschake explained that while there is a good candidate for software engineers (cloud code spec machine) and initial ideas for UX designers, product management is likely to become the bottleneck if engineering and UX speed up. The challenge lies in effectively supporting product managers in providing better and faster context to feed the development pipeline (00:01:56).

* Context-Driven Product Management and Knowledge Curation Nikita Gorshkov introduced their concept of context-driven product management, which has evolved since its initial version (00:03:19). They believe that product management is highly interconnected, requiring a lift-and-shift transition in working methods rather than peacemeal automation to gain the full benefits of AI. Nikita Gorshkov has developed a custom system using cloud code across two machines to maintain their own knowledge base of entities and relationships, which continuously learns and adds context to improve the output quality of generative AI tools (00:04:48).

* Challenges with Scaling Context Management and Infrastructure Mario Konschake noted that Nikita Gorshkov's approach of curating a context knowledge base seems to be a common pattern among AI-engaged product managers (00:06:06). Nikita Gorshkov raised concerns about scaling this, emphasizing the need to define future infrastructure and tools, ideally for one to two years, to avoid multiplying inefficiencies. A critical challenge is the lack of a consolidated source of truth, as people are using various tools, making learning non-transferable and knowledge management a persistent problem (00:07:29).

* Need for Centralized Documentation and Access Nikita Gorshkov highlighted the difficulty in identifying the correct version of documentation across systems like Google Docs, Confluence, and Jira, calling it a "nightmare" that is exacerbated by AI (00:09:07). They noted that institutional knowledge often resides in disparate places—Slack, random Google Docs, and code—and there is no clear indicator of the most current or accurate information (00:11:42). Mario Konschake agreed that the challenge lies in making knowledge accessi

to a little bit

Nikita Gorshkov: Sounds good. And I'll probably as a at some point I'll update the documents that I uh at

 

 

00:27:24

 

Mario Konschake: more.

Nikita Gorshkov: least like I believe in the document I wrote uh before I was building it based on notebook essentially for so that people don't get scared about CLI tools and cursor and stuff like that. Um, I'll probably be updating it to like to that next step of okay, how do you then you do all of the processes that uh you want to automate but through like clock codes for example and then share it at least with my PMs and whoever wants to read it. Um,

Mario Konschake: Yeah,

Nikita Gorshkov: and there's a notebook to ask

Mario Konschake: it would also be good feedback for me to understand like how uh how that will work

Nikita Gorshkov: questions.

Mario Konschake: with your PMS kind of CLI, right? is that is something that they are struggling with or they like first of all are they like curious eager to try it out uh and then is that something that is difficult for them or is that actually something that they can learn if they want to so that's I think it's a very important data point for me at this point as

Nikita Gorshkov: I don't think it's that complic.

Mario Konschake: well

Nikita Gorshkov: It's just you need to get used to it. And yeah.

Mario Konschake: yeah I'm a little bit burned because with starters we've made the assumption that like people can learn git

Nikita Gorshkov: Um,

Mario Konschake: analyst And that was not right. Uh so they they struggle some like some part some uh some of them

Nikita Gorshkov: really

Mario Konschake: struggled with that quite significantly. So that was a bit of a hurdle that we had.

Nikita Gorshkov: interesting.

Mario Konschake: Yeah. But also kit can get really

Nikita Gorshkov: Oh, yeah. It's It's I was What is it?

Mario Konschake: difficult.

Nikita Gorshkov: I had a very simple thing recently. I wanted to have a public repo be created from a folder within my private repo. And then I started reading about these sub subcomponents uh or uh within git and I was like why is this so f****** complicated guys? It's not the hardest thing that we're trying to do here. Yeah.

,,

,Plan,Pricing Principles at Launch

,All,Max box price should be $250 

,Fresh/Topper/Mixed,Max freezer fill is 1/3 a small NYC apt freezer

,Fresh,Aim to price lower than TFD but only if we can make PC2 margins and economics work

,All,Charge shipping separate to box price

,All,Shipping free in first order

,All,Price per day for trial is same as for regular box before discount

,All,Price per lb does not need to decrease as calories increase within same plan although it should go in that general direction

,All,"If we ship the same amount of product, the price should be the same"

,,

,Step,Description

,1: Import costs,All costs by plan imported into pricing file

,2: Benchmark,Competitors benchmarked to build up their pricing curves

,3: Scenarios,"High level pricing scenarios chosen per plan - final scenarios chosen:
- Fresh: Match TFD prices excluding shipping fee. Fresh is headline price to fix rest to
- Mixed: Should be 5-15% below Fresh depending on size and margins
- Topper: Should be 55-62.5% of Fresh price for 50% of product depending on size and margins
- Dry: Should be lowest price and price at 38% margins"

,4: Smooth pricing,Scenarios lead to choppy pricing. This was then smoothed

,5: Check PC2 / ROIs,PC2 and ROI reviewed to increase prices and improve margins where they were low

,6: Make steps,"If giving the same qty of product for 2 or more different SKUs, the prices were matched to create some stepped pricing"

,,

,,

,Type,Elements to Change in Price Test

,Architecture issue,Ensure same amount of food in box is always the same price

,Architecture issue,Review price per Lb curves i.e. price per LB should go down as calories increase

,Architecture issue,Review PC2 margins by calories within plan; and PC2 margins across calories

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Air Dried price to have lower entry price point to increase TAM

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Fresh price to be more competitive with Farmers Dog & Ollie

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Mixed price to sit in appropriate area between Fresh & Air Dried (being wary where Pantry Fresh would be)

,Architecture issue,"Lower price for larger dogs more than smaller dogs to encourage share of larger, higher ROI dogs"

[p]What's missing here?

[q]Out of curiosity, how often do we need to do competitive analysis?

[r]If we think this is really important I would DM people asking if they have something to share. If yes why they are not sharing it. Historically, I had way more survey answers when messaging people direct and trying to figure out why they where not answering it.

﻿PRD

Product Requirements Document (PRD): Cancellation Funnel Unification

1. Overview & Purpose

This PRD outlines the requirements for unifying the cancellation funnels across all HelloFresh Group brands. The primary goal is to leverage the existing HelloFresh cancellation funnel, including its deflection strategies and cancellation survey, and apply it to the remaining RTE, meal kit and new venture brands. This initiative aims to standardize the cancellation experience, improve customer retention for Factor and other brands, and streamline operational and technical maintenance. Depending on the engineering complexity, we consider two possible rollout scenarios:

1. [preferred] A/B test for all brands excl. Hellofresh, with control = BAU and variation = complete unified funnel. Alternatively, the test can target Factor US customers only.

2. Roll out without an A/B test, with the pre-post performance analysis

Decision about the prioritised rollout scenario will be taken by Karolina Zak/Edward Day once the effort estimation is known.

2. Goals & Non-Goals

Goals:

1. Use Hellofresh Cancellation Funnel UX in the remaining brands: Replicate the proven HelloFresh cancellation flow UX, including deflections and feedback collection, onto the other brands (all meal-kit, all RTE, The PetsTable, GoodChop, Factor Form, ?Factor Programs?[a][b][c][d]).

   1. !! This requirement does not mean using Hellofresh funnel code across brands. The initial engineering proposal is to create a new cancellation funnel module and move the Hellofresh flow pieces into this new cross-brand funnel. Once this is setup we can migrate the funnels to use this new app

2. Easy handling of all funnel variations: all the existing cancellation funnel variations (BAU flow, one-step funnel, one-click funnel, French adjusted funnel) need to be handled in a scalable way and allow reusing existing flows in other brands and markets

3. Standardize Cancellation Surveys: Implement the HelloFresh cancellation survey framework for other brands to gather consistent customer feedback on reasons for cancellation.

4. Unify Deflection Strategies: Make all existing deflection mechanisms available for use (not necessarily enabled) in all other brands cancellation funnels, including:

   1. Special deflections offered in a dedicated page sections:

      1. Benefits of keeping the subscription active (available discounts & credits, loyalty program status) → do not show if a customer doesn’t have a discount nor credit nor loyalty program status

      2. Switch to other brand (offered post cancellation) → Removed from the initiative scope. Remember to keep it live for Hellofresh brand.

   2. Regular deflections offered in small modular boxes:

      1. Offer new discount - Emmanuelle Hazeauxto clarify the ownership of the voucher creation for all brands and markets → changed from special deflection to the regular module - needs small design change

      2. Change plan frequency → links to the second step of the deflection, where customers can select alternative plan frequency

      3. Change plan size → there’s no price information, it has one of the lowest deflection rates. Therefore in the new funnel we want to send customers directly to the subscription settings page (!different links for different brands: HF /account-settings/subscription-settings, Factor /settings/plan/plan-selection)

      4. Help me skip → change to “Skip instead of cancel”, redirect to the homepage/single week page with a simple onboarding about using “Edit delivery” feature (only if skipping CTA is hidden

... [TRUNCATED: 15540 chars omitted to save context] ...

l not support having an active RTE subscription without an active meal kit subscription so for launch we added an "orchestration layer" that cancels the RTE subscription when the meal kit subscription is cancelled

[p]@nikita.gorshkov@hellofresh.com @kza@hellofresh.com It's not clear to me what consequences this project has for analytics - are cancellation metrics and GA events already aligned cross-brand or would we have to shake up our events and reporting as part of this push?





How about dashboarding?

[q]+ revisit the cancellation dashboard

[r]I think this needs to be investigated a bit further, but general cancellation metrics should be unified overal (at least looking at Tableau as the SoT here). Of course, cancellation reason-level reporting is different.

[s]what about Voice of customer team, should we we consider them as dependencies as they are the primary users of the cancellation survey results, maybe we need to check how it would impact them

Juan Sebastian Hernandez reacted with 🙏 at 2025-09-05 15:25 PM

[t]Who would be your primary contact for this team?

[u]@juan.hernandez@hellofresh.com

[v]@kza@hellofresh.com my read from this is that we don't make any changes to the BAU survey experience for any brand/market other than maybe the UI - am I right in this?

[w]Hey team, hope you're doing well and thanks for flagging @ehaz@hellofresh.co. I assume that from our end there is no big change as we only send the comments to Chattermill. Not sure if this would affect more the existing categories in Cancellation data sets, so I'll add @winnie.huang@hellofresh.com to the conversation

[x]Q on my side - how do we ensure market level compliance?

[y]what do you mean by compliance? Compliance to regulations?

[z]Yes cancellation tends to be regulated at a local level.





On top of legal compliance, I wonder if there are non-legal decisions we've taken at a local level that we also should look to preserve

[aa]Q2: Governance - the ability to change survey & deflections by brand/market will only be available to the owning _technical_ team right? We have no requirements to enable other stakeholders to modify this?

[ab]If so, it means owning tech team owns final decision on local setups (with local input) due to balancing capacity

[ac]i don't know why i imagined green chef being also sustainable so i'm curious why is not there today

Once the design is perfect, click “Apply” to delegate your visual changes to the agent.



Debug Mode



Debug Mode ( https://cursor.com/blog/debug-mode ) is a new way to fix tricky bugs. Instead of writing new code, prompt the agent with a description of the issue. Then, the agent explores your codebase, adds instrumentation, and uses runtime logs to find and fix the root cause.



Try Debug Mode and everything else new in Cursor 2.2 ( https://cursor.com/changelog/2-2 ).



We’re excited to see how you use it!



Best,

Cursor Team

ID: 19b23d9151931690
From: "'Rachel LeMier' via EveryPlate Recipe Survey Results" <ep-recipe-survey-results@hellofresh.com>
----------------------------------------

Hi team,





EveryPlate 2025 Week 48 resulted in an overall menu score of 3.46 (-0.04 target

score of 3.50, -0.08 vs planned menu score of 3.54).





CPI Commentary: W48 was Thanksgiving week, leading to limited amount of

feedback. Low performers this week included slot 1 (Crispy Chicken with

Honey Dijon Drizzle) and a new meal (Meatloaf Sandwiches) but commentary

was very sparse making it hard to determine why these meals underperformed.





Please see our full report

Recipe of the Week: Honey Sriracha Fried Chicken, RS 3.83. L4 "Fan

Farewell Matthijs 🦖☄️

Tuesday Dec 16, 2025 ⋅ 17:00 – 18:50

Central European Time - Berlin







Room is Parterre - I can't edit the invite from office  

management----------Dear Friends and HelloFresh Family,After 10 years and  

being called a dinosaur multiple times, my meteor has finally struck, and I  

will be leaving HelloFresh on December 19th. I ordered the meteor myself  

with this app, and will start my next chapter there. It's been a pleasure  

and honour to have worked with all of you.I'll be doing a "goodbye thing"  

next Tuesday, 16th, from 17-19h @R16 Partere.I'm not really huge on  

throwing parties, so it would be amazing if none of you could make  

it.However, there is a rumor that @Justin Zinck will be playing his  

clarinet. If &gt;1 person accepts the invite that will follow, there will  

be drinks and pizza.Cheers!

### EMAIL: Notes: “Connect on CA B2B Shopify Integration” Dec 15, 2025

Summary



Elysa Viti initiated a discussion with Nikita Gorshkov about the Canadian  

B2B site, which requires Shopify as middleware because no current systems,  

except Katana, support the necessary B2B functionality out of the box; the  

site aims to automate small business employee orders (Factor only), which  

are currently manual and error-prone. Nikita Gorshkov emphasized that the  

success of B2B depends on a strong sales presence, and confirmed that zero  

people are currently allocated to B2B development, with expectations that a  

dedicated B2B team may be pushed for around June, leading Elysa Viti to  

estimate a Q3 launch for the Shopify integration. The strategy for the  

first half of the year involves manually testing streams like sports teams  

and gyms, and Elysa Viti suggested a separate team should handle B2B.





Suggested next steps





Elysa Viti will talk to Kieran and have him send over his business case so  

that she can tweak it for Canada.



Elysa Viti will forward all meeting notes over to Kevin and Cole for them  

to read up on and will keep Nikita Gorshkov posted on any questions.

Summary



Jenna O'Shea and Nikita Gorshkov discussed the immediate need to hire a  

mid-level designer for the Good Chop replacement position, with Jenna  

O'Shea preferring a mid-level role for long-term growth and Nikita Gorshkov  

emphasizing the candidate's need to be systematic. Regarding team  

management, Jenna O'Shea committed to being more hands-on and coaching Mega  

on stakeholder management, while they also decided to bundle design  

critiques for New Ventures and Shopping to promote knowledge transfer and  

suggested involving Nikita Gorshkov or Daniel in the hiring interviews.  

They also discussed Nikita Gorshkov's concern over the VMS Shopify store's  

templated design and "lack of ownership," and established the Factor Form  

strategy of integrating it into Factor if the Shopify store fails.





Suggested next steps





Jenna O'Shea will refine the New Brand's Jira board with sprint goals for  

designers by January 5th.



Jenna O'Shea will look for opportunities to open the position for 'good  

chop' sooner than January.



Nikita Gorshkov will ping Shay to connect with Jenna O'Shea for a demo to  

address UX issues for the factor forum subbrands.



Jenna O'Shea will put Yumi and Michael into a conversation to close the  

loop on the UX audit for factor form.



Jenna O'Shea will look into other rooms that she's supposed to be in.



The group will bundle the design critiques for new ventures and shopping  

together.
