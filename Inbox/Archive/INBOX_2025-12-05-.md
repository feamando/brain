Summary

Hamed Karimian and Nikita Gorshkov reviewed the OTP launch timeline, with Nikita Gorshkov recommending pushing the full launch to Monday of week two to mitigate risks associated with limited team bandwidth and outstanding items in week 51. Hamed Karimian and Nikita Gorshkov also discussed the broken mobile app prototype link and factor app ownership, with Nikita Gorshkov suggesting Laura and the shopping experience leadership as the primary contact for design alignment; Hamed Karimian confirmed he would reach out to them and also meet with Dio and Alisa. Finally, Hamed Karimian updated Nikita Gorshkov on the decision by Samir and Allison to implement Shopify redirects to prevent multiple accounts across the two websites, which Nikita Gorshkov agreed to maintain given the small expected impact.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* OTP Launch Planning and Timeline Hamed Karimian discussed the One-Time Password (OTP) launch, presenting the original plan for a week 51 launch for 90% of users despite risks due to proximity to year-end dates, as well as an option for a soft launch or launching in week two. Hamed Karimian and Nikita Gorshkov reviewed historical traffic data, with Nikita Gorshkov suggesting that due to the calendar year, week one would still see low traffic, making week two a less impactful time for launching compared to last year's data (00:03:55). Nikita Gorshkov ultimately recommended pushing the full launch to Monday of week two, doing a full launch rather than a soft launch, to mitigate risks associated with the limited team bandwidth and outstanding items in week 51 (00:05:20).

* Mobile App Prototype and Ownership Alignment Hamed Karimian mentioned that the link to the full-functioning mobile app prototype was broken, but they had presented it in an "early and often" meeting and would share the updated link from Michael in the next call (00:07:35). Hamed Karimian asked about the owner of the factor app to align designs, and Nikita Gorshkov indicated that the ownership is distributed, suggesting that the shopping experience leadership, specifically Laura for merchandising components and add-to-cart rate, would be the primary contact (00:09:01). Hamed Karimian confirmed they will reach out to them and also have a meeting with Dio and Alisa from the shopping experience team to ensure the prototype does not interfere with the factor side or factor app designs (00:10:19).

* Shopify Redirects Compromise Hamed Karimian updated Nikita Gorshkov on the decision by Samir and Allison to implement Shopify redirects, which creates a disjointed experience where net new users from legacy pages are redirected to Shopify, and existing users with Factor accounts who land on Shopify are redirected back to the legacy page (00:11:59). This compromise was adopted because the main challenge was prioritizing not having multiple accounts across the two websites, especially to ensure users see their Factor subscriptions and past orders (00:13:08). Hamed Karimian noted that they have tracking in place to monitor the number of redirects, and Nikita Gorshkov agreed to keep the current setup since it is expected to affect only a small percentage of users (00:14:29).





Suggested next steps

* The group will have all end-to-end testing and everything ready for the OTP launch by the end of week 51.

* The group will turn on the feature flag for the OTP launch in week two.

n I find the Shopify website from any like paid channel or anything and then I log into that and I don't see any of my subscriptions any of my

Nikita Gorshkov: From there. Yep.

Hamed Karimian: past orders and so on I'm like, "Oh, I did have some subscriptions. I

Nikita Gorshkov: Mhm.

Hamed Karimian: just got a box yesterday. Where did that go?" So, the plan is to redirect them back to the legacy page so they can It's not for factor males, it's for factor form.

 

 

00:14:29

 

Nikita Gorshkov: But why not then have a notes that uh for your factor meals go to X.

Hamed Karimian: So if they have a factor form subscription, right, and they go to Shopify, they won't see that.

Nikita Gorshkov: Okay. Yes. Wait. And you're selecting so basically you're checking if there's a factor accounts that has a particular plan type.

Hamed Karimian: Correct.

Nikita Gorshkov: H interesting. Okay.

Hamed Karimian: Yeah. And we are you know we have some tracking on it as well. So we can monitor the number of people who are being redirected from one to the other. If that number is high we need to probably think about an alternative solution.

Nikita Gorshkov: H. Huh.

Hamed Karimian: But hypothetically it should just affect a small percentage of our users because you know from all all the SEO channels from all the organic ones you know anything we are sending all the net new users to the Shopify website and then whoever is on the legacy page is technically the ones who already have an uh active factor subscription like me subscription So yeah, it should be fine for probably maybe 95

Nikita Gorshkov: Mhm. Okay.

Hamed Karimian: plus percentage of the users if not more.

Nikita Gorshkov: Okay. Let's keep it as is right now. At the end of the day, it's not going to impact too many people overall.

Hamed Karimian: Sure.

Nikita Gorshkov: So, and yeah, we maybe we'll come up with a better idea. I don't have a better idea right now. Cool. Okay. All right, man. I'm going to run.

Hamed Karimian: Okay. Any anything else on on your end? Anything from

Nikita Gorshkov: No. Oh, good. My man, thank you so much. You were super quick on on the road map stuff. So, the whole um workshop yesterday went really well.

Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Ian Brooks and Nikita Gorshkov discussed the challenges of poor personalization, including menu repeats, resulting from the current recommendation engine, which Ian Brooks suggested requires a UX overhaul using a more food-based, "restaurant"-style approach for "total choice for chef's plate" implementation. Nikita Gorshkov confirmed the leadership for the creator platform/marketplace will be Lineia Serisma for product strategy, Cole Banning for growth, and Melanie Schmidt for project management, with an MVP focused on simple, occasion-based boxes for one-off purchases via social media. They also addressed the organization of Market Innovation, with Nikita Gorshkov proposing a new prioritization structure, and Ian Brooks agreeing to serve as the delegate for international markets while emphasizing the need for guardrails to mitigate US market dominance in resource allocation.

Notes Length: Standard

* Personalization and Menu Timelines Ian Brooks is focused on understanding the timelines and implications of "harp penguin liar nextgen harp" in the context of "total choice for chef's plate" and discussed the unintended consequences of poor personalization on their current HelloFresh menu. Ian Brooks demonstrated that their personalized menu defaults included a high volume of repeats, specifically Mexican and pasta dishes, requiring them to scroll through 20 recipes before encountering variety, leading to variety and repetition complaints that are 2x higher in their market than any other (00:03:15). Ian Brooks shared that they have videos of this issue to send to Nikita Gorshkov (00:05:39).

* Personalization and UX Issues Ian Brooks contends that the current recommendation engine, which they believe is "liar" and not "harp," has not adjusted for active selections and continues to show repeated defaults, leading to a "terrible experience" (00:04:21). Ian Brooks stated that proper UX and recommendation/personalization is a prerequisite for implementing "total choice" for Chef's Plate, given the potential problems that would arise in a 600-slot menu (00:08:10). Nikita Gorshkov agreed that a 500-recipe menu could result in 10 screens of pasta dishes, especially on mobile (00:09:39).

* Proposal for UX Overhaul Ian Brooks proposed adopting a more food-based, DoorDash/Uber Eats type of UX, rather than the current functional organization, which is not how people shop for food (00:09:39). Ian Brooks suggested organizing recipes by "restaurants" like "the sushi restaurant at HelloFresh" and allowing recipes to dynamically group into multiple categories to inspire exploration, moving away from a format where every recipe fits in only one bucket (00:10:48). Ian Brooks argued that the current UX is a "mistake born of hubris" because they are attempting to reinvent the UX when customers are already accustomed to the standard grocery or food ordering platform experiences, despite holding only a 1% share of weeknight dinners in their market (00:13:17).

* Creator Platform/Marketplace Leadership and Potential Nikita Gorshkov raised the topic of the creator program/marketplace, confirming the leaders for the Canada side will be Lineia Serisma for product strategy and Cole Banning for growth, with Melanie Schmidt handling the project management (00:17:40). Nikita Gorshkov reported that the initial creator interviews showed a "generically positive response," exceeding the positivity seen

: I can be involved. I'm happy to be involved. Um, and and play whatever role you guys want me to play.

Nikita Gorshkov: The reality is like the why I was thinking for for you to be that champion or ombbudsman for for the international markets is that would allow a um to consolidate some of those requirements or or at least sell

 

 

00:30:11

 

Ian Brooks: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: some of the bigger bets that we have uh to those markets. and therefore increase that you know the weight of any requests that's coming from them and number two is that I know that Canada and you yourself are all always game for new experiments and big bets whereas not all the markets are equipped to or don't necessarily always think about this in that way like Mhm.

Ian Brooks: No, I hear you. I hear you. So maybe maybe what you do is you propose that it's a rotating kind of chair type of thing. The concern I have I'm happy to do it. Okay, let me start with that. I'm happy to do it. I see your point and I'm happy to play ball. Um, maybe that's good enough for people. If it's not good enough for people, then we could set it up to be like it's going to rotate every year. someone else is going to be the delegate from the non US markets and but I would I would almost want you to tell me what you want me to do.

Nikita Gorshkov: H. M okay I see I need to run right now I'll consolidate a proposal in terms of how I see uh this input of new items working because right now it's all a bit of a free-for-all and then out of left field it gets convinced by somebody

Ian Brooks: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: that something is a priority and then it becomes a priority for us. I don't want to have this as outside of our visibility or control and I want to have like this as a more like clear and have that flexibility of like if I need the six people for the for

Ian Brooks: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: Q3 to work on influencer marketplace, I want to have the structure in place to actually invest into it and go forward rather than um you know just because we agreed to

Ian Brooks: Right. And so you know la last thought as you go and I want to have the ability to increase your resource level when things go well. Right. Right. Exactly.

Summary

Sameer Doda confirmed that the overall work volume is manageable, with Allison assisting on the platform and Good Chop Shopify projects, though Sameer Doda and Nikita Gorshkov noted that program revivals are unlikely due to a lack of resources, a point Sameer Doda, David, and Nikita Gorshkov discussed with Marina regarding unfunded work. Sameer Doda detailed their involvement in the complex Good Chop Shopify project, the DACH Juices support project for Nordic markets that requires a technical solution, and the Influencer Marketplace, which needs an MVP path forward due to varied stakeholder views and already has design progress with Shay; Sameer Doda and Nikita Gorshkov agreed on a simple one-time purchase customer journey for the MVP, but Sameer Doda raised concerns about limitations with applying vouchers and selling add-ons, which Nikita Gorshkov suggested discussing with Jama, and both acknowledged a need for more frontend development resources. Sameer Doda needs to coordinate with Jama for the roadmap review meeting and discussed the "Seamless Pricing Upgrade" initiative, which Nikita Gorshkov suggested de-prioritizing, while they also agreed to maintain two different views of the roadmap and implement an intake process with Ian as the tactical point of contact.

Notes Length: Standard

* Overall Work Volume and Resource Allocation Sameer Doda confirmed that their overall volume of work is manageable, with Allison assisting on the platform and Good Chop Shopify projects. Sameer Doda and Nikita Gorshkov discussed that the revival of programs is unlikely soon due to a lack of available resources, unless it is fully funded, a decision that would need to come from Dominic (00:00:49) (00:04:03). Nikita Gorshkov noted that they, along with David, pushed back on Marina for introducing unfunded work that was taking up design capacity (00:03:05).

* Shopify Initiatives (Factor Form and Good Chop) Sameer Doda outlined their involvement in the Shopify projects, specifically Good Chop, which they anticipate will be more complex than Factor Form due to potential changes in the customer journey (00:00:49). The immediate next steps for the Good Chop project include developing a strategy document, creating a customer journey, and addressing edge cases such as account duplication and customer redirects, in addition to tactical work like third-party integrations (e.g., Recharge and Elevar) (00:02:10). Sameer Doda is confident that they can now manage the setup of Recharge if Allison is unavailable (00:03:05).

* DACH Juices Support Project Sameer Doda explained that Jama brought up a project to support launching juices in the Nordic markets, which Sameer Doda discussed with stakeholders and promised to provide timelines for in January (00:04:54). The required technical work involves automatically adding fan charges as a separate line item to the cart and to the auto summary when a juice pack is added, a task that is more complicated than it appears. Sameer Doda plans to create a requirements document after receiving answers to questions they posed to Viola (00:06:15).

* Influencer Marketplace Strategy and Customer Journey Sameer Doda has gone through all the research documents for the influencer marketplace and believes the initiative needs a proposed path forward for the MVP due to the variety of stakeholder views. They have created two separate customer journeys: one for customers

e used to do was that we used to write it down in these cells themselves. Uh allocation start. So allocating allocating in these in these boxes themselves it kind of gives Oh yeah I I agree all of these versions they work perfectly.

Nikita Gorshkov: dude, I think over the 17 years I've seen every single version of how a road map can humanly look like. Oh, like uh I've updated the initiatives log with the new items that uh they had on this wish list.

Sameer Doda: It's just about I I think it boils down to personal preferences at the end of it and the ease of use for for at an individual level. That that's pretty much it.

Nikita Gorshkov: Uh yeah, I don't know how it's maintained or or updated, but at least now it's Yep, agree.

 

 

00:29:54

 

Sameer Doda: Okay, I also created this intake sheet. Uh if you see the third tab, we can probably start evangelizing this as well for anyone who wants to add a request, they can add to this.

Nikita Gorshkov: We just need to figure out how exactly we and to whom we do evangelize this.

Sameer Doda: I know, I know, I get it.

Nikita Gorshkov: My my targets are going to be I want to make that Ian the tactical point of contact essentially like I don't want to be talking with a thousand different people. Uh, and I don't uh or you talking with a thousand different people and I don't want us to be talking like three times a week because like uh with Ed because that's a recipe for failure. He has way too much s*** on his uh plate so he will never be available and then we're here shoveling dirt from oh US is saying one thing and Ben is saying another thing.

Sameer Doda: Oh, yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: So I do want like Ian maybe and maybe somebody on the US sides to actually like have a small group of like decision makers and if there's a tiebreaker that's needed on that level or above then yes we can go to it.

Sameer Doda: Yeah, 100%. But I mean even Jama said that the frequency for such a road map review would be like once a month something like that just to give visibility on where we are and all of these other decisions on what

Nikita Gorshkov: That's true.

Sameer Doda: gets prioritized on the road map can be handled se separately. Cool. Uh yeah.

Enabling One-Time-Purchase (OTP) Capabilities for HF Groups Customers

	Summary: One-time-purchases enable HelloFresh to address customer needs for order flexibility, accessibility and concerns around subscription commitment, while enabling new ways to engage with existing, new and past customers across a variety of different use cases. This PRD aims to consolidate all known use cases for OTP in 2025 for HFG to define a path forward towards implementation.

[HOW TO READ] This document is structured based on three big parts:

1. Summary & High-Level Overview Tab: These tabs serve as the central strategic hub. It outlines context and brief customer flows for each major use case (e.g., Good Chop, Seasonal Boxes) to give a quick understanding of the customer journey. It also synthesizes the Key Functionalities that need to be built across all these different use cases.

2. Individual Use Case Tabs (e.g., "Experience - Good Chop", "Experience - Seasonal Boxes"): Each of these dedicated tabs dives deep into a specific product or initiative. They break down the requirements by Milestones (e.g., MVP - Milestone 1), providing a clear roadmap from a use case perspective. The requirements are listed with User Stories and Acceptance Criteria format.

3. Dependency Tab: These tabs are used to identify and detail any specific work or information required from dependent Tribes and alliances.

1. Summary View of the Solution Proposed

This initiative aims to deliver a One-Time-Purchase (OTP) capability experience across HelloFresh Group brands. As of June 2025, across HelloFresh, several use cases had been identified—such as event-themed seasonal boxes, curated selections of specialized items (e.g., premium meat and seafood from Good Chop), items from a broader marketplace of third-party CPG brands, or ready-to-eat meals from sister brands like Factor—as standalone purchases, without the necessity of an active weekly meal kit subscription for that particular transaction (though OTP may also complement existing subscriptions).

The solution involves creating a seamless OTP user flow within each participating brand's digital platform. This includes clear product discovery for OTP-eligible items, transparent pricing and benefits, distinct OTP cart[a] and checkout processes, appropriate order management for both new and existing customers (subscribed, paused, or cancelled), and downstream capabilities such as delivery management and data.

This foundational OTP capability will initially be piloted and rolled out for:

1. 2025 Initiative Rollouts: 

   1. Seasonal Boxes across HelloFresh (similar to the ANZ model but integrated).

   2. Good Chop offerings for both prospects and actives.

   3. Factor Form item based OTP purchase

2. 2026 Potential Targets:

   1. A 2-Way Marketplace on a selected HelloFresh brand (e.g., Green Chef US pilot) (potential PoC in Q4 2025) 

   2. Cross-selling of Factor meals (as OTP) (iteration on the “Opt-in” Market Integration Model)

   3. Further discovery m

create add-on menus, call another menu, etc. if we don't have to.

[cb]@mabu@hellofresh.com lmk if this is clearer now @nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com

[cc]What's "GST charge"?

[cd]Goods and Service Fee - NZ is set at 15% and is normally baked into products sold and AU is 10% but there are different rules to consider in order to remain compliant.

[ce]Assuming this would be a separate payment for customers who may also be ordering a regular subscription box? Similarly to how we charge HFM currently?

[cf]Payment details are never stored in the HF system, hence, it is not possible to prefill payment details. What we can try doing is "use existing payment" which would be a reference to a payment token.

[cg]What do we mean by this?

[ch]@nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com i assume you mean all the payment methods?

[ci]Does it mean that the data of OTP should be a part of analytics and should be identifiable as OTP?

[cj]essential to note that customers who have already purchased a seasonal box to be excluded from future CRM emails (i.e. if someone bought a Christmas box at full price, should not get a Black Friday discount email)

Notes

* OTP Launch → decision: to have FF turn on in W02, but everything should be ready by EOY





Options

	Pros

	Cons

	Decision

	Launch W50

	More time before AD/ND

Time to iterate if issues

Time to rollout gradually





	Won’t make it! 

Less time for e2e testing

	No Go

	Launch W51 (To 90% of users)

	Original plan

On-track from dev pov

Captures business value earlier (~$15k in revenue)





	Super risky as most devs are out (Jordon, Jan, Edwin, Emily, Daniel, Travis)

Super close to EOY

Might break something on Factor

Not enough time for gradual rollout

On-calls: Emily Stanek (W50), Paul Andrews (W51/52)

	Maybe

	Launch W51 

(To only 10%)

	Mitigates the risk

Collects some feedback before the peak

	Still risky (Not enough devs to support)

Limited business impact





	No Go

	Launch W02

(To 90% of users)

	Less risky (Devs available for support)

Still before the actual peak

Won’t break anything on Factor/FF

	Delayed launch

Opportunity cost





	Go! 

	  W46 2024 - W04 2025 → The market is pretty soft over the last few weeks of the year

* Mobile app prototype

   * Who’s the owner of Factor App? → Shopping experience () & Merchandizing (Elisa Marku Laura Mneimneh) 

* Early & Often slides

* Shopify redirects → We might change that in the future depending on the number of redirects

   * Net New users: from legacy to shopify

   * RTE users: from Shopify to legacy





Action items

ckable only — no code).





Recruit 10–15 representative users (existing customers or target personas).





Ask them to choose between:





Current “build-your-own” flow





The new “plan-based” flow





Ask follow-ups:





Which feels more tailored to you?





Which would you trust more?





How likely are you to purchase?





✅ Advantages: Fast qualitative signal; surfaces objections early.

💡 Tip: Use Figma Analytics or Maze metrics (time on screen, clicks) for light quant data.





Option 3: “Fake Door” Test in Live Site





Goal: Measure real interest from actual users without building full functionality.





On your live PLP or homepage, add a new section or banner:





“Introducing our new lifestyle plans — Performance, Focus, and Foundation.”

CTA: “Explore Plans.”





When users click, send them to a “Coming Soon” page or a short survey:





“We’re launching soon — tell us which plan interests you most.”





Measure clicks, plan preference, and sign-ups for early access.





✅ Advantages: True behavioral data from live traffic.

💡 Tip: Works well if your current site already gets meaningful volume.





Option 4: Email or CRM Campaign Test





Goal: Validate resonance of messaging and pricing.





Segment your customer base (athletes, busy professionals, general wellness).





Send A/B email variants — one promoting current product set, one promoting “plans.”





Measure CTR, click-to-checkout, or pre-order intent.





✅ Advantages: Zero dev time, quick pulse check on messaging effectiveness.





📊 How to Evaluate Results

Metric        Signal        Success Criteria

CTR / engagement        Do users click into plan-based offers more than product-based ones?        +15–20% vs. baseline

Intent (survey or fake door)        Are users more likely to say they’d subscribe?        Majority (>60%) positive

AOV (simulated)        When choosing a plan, is average intended spend higher?        +10–15% lift

Qualitative sentiment        Do users say the plan feels easier, more relevant, or trustworthy?        Positive pattern emerges





If 2–3 of these indicators trend positively, that’s a green light to justify design + dev investment for a live experiment.





🚀 Recommended Next Step (Low-Effort, High-Insight)





Build a simple Figma prototype with your three plans + “Choose Plan” CTA, and test it via qualitative plan. (Option 2)

### DOC: GoC H1 2026 Product Prioritization - WIP

﻿2026 Strategy

FTEs: 8 devs (3 parental fill, 2 backfills) → Q2 7 FE devs (+ 1EM +2 POs) + [new] 2 FE devs + 1 BE 

H2 2025 Reflection

In H2 2025, our product strategy was designed to address unrecovered Conversion Rates (CR) and declining Active Order Rates (AOR). For CR, we successfully launched the Reactivation page revamp and are on progress to launch the One Time Purchase experiment. On the AOR side, we drove Free Add-on take rates to over 90% consistently by closing gaps in the selection and persistence experience, and launched Charge at Checkout.

1. Reactivation Page Revamp. We launched a new, mobile-first reactivation page that reduces the page length by one third with improvements on information architecture and clearer call to action. Also, customers can now choose their free add-ons directly on the reactivation page, instead of after reactivating their accounts. These changes are foundational to run more free for life reactivation campaigns including turkeys on Thanksgiving  (+20% CR YoY). However, some critical features were de-prioritized such as the ability to change cadence and reschedule directly on the reactivation page. 

2. One-Time Purchases (OTP). The technical solution for OTP pivoted from the initial MVP hack to the proper solution due to a technical blocker from CRM as well as higher confidence in the new endpoint following HF rollouts. While this solution saves time in the long-term, the launch week is delayed (likely W2’2026 - TBC) due to additional time for another technical investigation and (unplanned) capacity constraints.

3. Closing Free Add-on Take Rate. By October we finally reached +90% free add-on take rate for both new and active users consistently. Persisting free add-ons (+40% active TR), developing the multi-add-on pop-up on funnel and reactivation (+5% TR), and migrating bundle offers to Wallet (4.2k customers). While it’s great that we finally closed down the Wallet take rate gap, a significant portion of Q3 engineering capacity was allocated, which was not originally accounted for in the H2 roadmap.

4. Charge at Checkout. By charging customers at checkout instead of at cut-off, we aim to improve empty conversions and acceptance rates, thereby positively impacting overall delivered orders.





Learnings: 

* Better resource planning for adhoc and technical initiatives needed: We only executed on 2 out of 5 key strategies referenced in the previous strategy document with projects such as the Pricing Value Experiment getting pushed to next year. When planning for H2 2025, we did not initially account for initiatives such as Subscribable free add ons, as well as more tactical initiatives like 2-week cadence or legal compliance initiatives in the (cancellation) funnel. Engineering capacity was also impacted around September-October due to personnel changes, including one transfer to TPT and two individuals taking parental leave. We also need to proactively account for resourcing technical initiatives such as endpoint deprecations and migrations.

* More space needed for iterations: there are initiatives such as Seamless and Search with clear next iterations, however instead of building these we focused on building new initiatives. This delays implementing these learnings and therefore realization of business value. Doing these next iterations with too much time in between can also lengthen development as the team has to re-learn the technical context for the next iteration, or as previous feature leads churn from the team.

Q1 2026: Closing the Gaps an

ith new delivery options with 1 day cutoff

[p]i think this should be dependent on OTP leads results

[q]how come? I don't think the learnings from Leads test will necessarily transfer





It could work better because cancelled customers might have already experienced first-hand that subscription does not work 





We could even think about targeting specifically customers that have churned due to delivery frequency reasons

[r]-> hesitation more from a BC perspective + no ability to discount





-> refer to HF test learnings

[s]~10% cancel for "lifestyle" reason (="sub doens't work for me")

[u]that can be a significant lever for AOR and PC2 improvement, should we move fw knowing that part of it will be unlocked with the value test

[v]open to continuing price/value exp hack

[w]lay out limitations with hacks (eg roll out strategy)

[x]1 total reaction

Marina Guthmann reacted with ♥️ at 2025-12-03 15:40 PM

[y]potentially already planned for CDP v2 to fix data lag

[z]it would be interesting to sequence the rebranding with value driven initiatives, such as richer PDPs. so we can collaborate with mktg on how to tackle the changes' communications

[aa]in the end if we want to do this well and continue highlighting new products, new deals, we eventually need to find a way to showcase surcharge cuts pre-checkout





I'm wondering if we should re-test surcharge pre-checkout but as its own section/maybe even bringing the 2-step flow pre-checkout 





because if we find a good way to frame surcharge cuts and Deals pre-checkout, then we will have more merchandising we can do pre-checkout as well





EOS+transparent pricing also a criteria

[ab]already big reasons to buy for prospects - we could target this to actives

﻿Final YP





💡 Meeting Notes [To be filled after the Review Meeting by the YP Document Owner and sent out via email to attendees. This section does not impact the maximum number of pages]

Review Meeting Date: Oct 16, 2025

Attendees: Ed Boyes Assaf Ronen Dominik Richter Holger Hammel,Cho HwangAnnie MeininghausDina MehrezThomas GrieselFabien SimonMarlene RosnerBrian LeungAdriana VillarEvan WeintraubJama Musse





Key Takeaways, Decisions, and Next Steps:

1. Clarify how menu expansion plans, personalization roll outs  and app features come together: 

   * Elysium (new store and homepage in the app) roll out is fast followed by new app feature which benefits users  irrespective of menu ranking roll out (most notably merchandising widgets for marketing,  recommendation widgets,bringing search to apps, populating “most popular, “trending” widgets - details)

   * Menu ranking roll out: At the same time there is a roll out plan for menu ranking models which prioritizes P500 readiness in Q4/Q1 as well as Penguin for Factor US. Food Systems is trying to expedite Penguin for INTL if possible, prioritized after p500. Fall back is to launch Penguin Harp personalization to INTL markets expanding in Q1.  Other RTE markets in H2.

2. Share prioritization framework  for Project 5M. The prioritization is heavily influenced by successful companies and features observed (direct or indirect competitors) as well as through an internal workshop. This revealed a consistent and significant behavioral gap: Users enthusiastically save recipes (often from social media) but rarely act on them. This indicates a high desire for inspiration but a significant friction point in execution. This led to the prioritization of the recipe bridge in Q4/Q1. If requested we can  walk through the detailed methodology.

3. Decouple forecasting from personalization models. Food Systems to define technical interfaces enabling independent iteration. Once validated, assess org impact in Q1–Q2.

4. Reconcile marketing RAF plan with tech YP.  We have addressed the  gap between Marketing and Consumer growth targets. Share squad will focus on strengthening the Refer-a-Friend (RAF) program while building new in-product sharing loops to drive organic growth. prioritizing foundational fixes — improving data visibility, customer experience, and operational agility — to make the RAF program self-sufficient and easier to optimize without tech dependencies. 

5. Variable pricing is an urgently requested feature by markets. We added it  to the Market Innovation squad backlog H2. Will define long-term ownership before initiation as we are currently moving pricing ownership to growth MA. 





Changes requested to the Yearly Plan during Draft Reviews. Please update before submission for final YP approval:  

* Should we invest into an AOV-focused squad? Yes we will self fund a new AOV driven squad in Q2 with a dedicated KPI. Focus in Q1  is first to roll out the new personalized core journey including widgets and then layer in more upselling components. 

* Loyalty strategy across markets: We decided to reserve a small team to  maintain and improve the existing  program while implementing  the new vendor based loyalty program to launch first in  the US . See Loyalty Strategy SMT Shareout.

* Double check if all Factor requirements are in the plan: All documents were collected and integrated into the Market Innovation backlog. To be signed off by Ed Boyes

   1. Meta backlog (MBL) released

   2. Mega-alliance creates quarterly plan, swarms on MBL items

   3. SMT signs off

* Q1 2026

   1. Mega-alliance creates bottom-up quarterly plan

   2. MBL released

   3. Mega-alliance adjusts quarterly plan based on MBL

Timeline

* Dec 3, 2025: Draft bottom-up tribe quarterly plans ready for review

* Dec 4, 2025: Half-day planning workshop with tribe leads

* Dec 8, 2025: Bottom-up Q1 quarterly plan ready for review

Format

Output

2026 Yearly Plan - Consumer Mega-Alliance (Final) - Q1

* Please fill in Table 6 for your squads

* Each cell in the table should contain one deliverable - pick the squad’s highest-priority deliverable for that month, don’t aggregate multiple deliverables

* To make the roadmap scannable, give each deliverable a short, descriptive name and highlight it in bold. You can optionally add a short description too, but keep it to 6 lines or less

Internal Working File

Consumer Mega-Alliance Roadmap

Eventually, we’ll find a way to generate this automatically. For now, let’s update the file manually





Instructions

* Initiative: 

   * Should represent a deliverable - don’t include discovery work

   * Should be human understandable - avoid domain jargon and acronyms; ask yourself whether a busy member of the SMT could understand what it means

   * Each squad should have at least 1 deliverable per month

* Description: 

   * formulate it as a product hypothesis (“we believe that by doing x, y will happen”), to make the connection with your squad KPI clear

* Product spec: 

   * Eventually, this should be a link to the product spec 

      * Details: AI-Native Product Development Handbook

   * For now, it can be any doc that provides product context (WBD, PRD, etc.)

* Tribe priority

   * Use this column to indicate the consolidated stack-rank of your tribe’s initiatives 

* Capacity planning

   * We need to have confidence that we can deliver the initiatives in the roadmap

   * We can approach this as a bottom-up or top-down exercise - see below

   * In either case, we want to timebox the planning to max. 2 weeks





Discussion Questions

* How should we communicate the stack-rank in the roadmap?

   * Start with prioritized backlog

   * Convert to roadmap, which considers urgency and other factors

   * Add tribe-level priority column

* How do we want to handle capacity planning?

   * Bottom-up: define scope, estimate effort, draw the line

   * Top-down: draw the line, allocate capacity, define scope (during the quarter)

Appendix: Existing Planning Docs

Please add links to any existing artefacts your squads are using to plan and visualise their roadmaps to the table below. We’ll consider them while creating the standardized template.

Intro

🚦 Q1 Planning Kick-off: Timeline & Immediate Actions

Now that the 2026 YP is finalized and the new org structure is live, we’re shifting focus to Q1 Planning. Awn and I learned yesterday that the due date for submitting our draft Q1 plan is Dec 5. 

We acknowledge there are still a few open questions about the "definition of done" for the Q1 plan (e.g., granularity, should it cover 100% of the team’s capacity or just what’s needed to deliver the Q1 meta-backlog, etc.). We’re working on clarifying these questions with Assaf and Brian to make sure we don't ask you all to do unnecessary work.

📅 The Plan for This Week:

* Tues: mega-alliance leads review the "definition of done" for Q1 plans with Assaf to confirm expectations (aiming for monthly deliverables by squad vs. detailed capacity plan).

* Fri: we’ll share the confirmed timeline, template, and process with you.

What you should do now (Don't wait for Friday):

* Product Leads: Start compiling your Q1 initiative backlog.

   * Break down your squads’ Q1 quarterly deliverables from the YP into chunks you expect to deliver in each month of the quarter. 

   * Notes: 

      * If the quarterly deliverables in the YP no longer reflect what you see as the best way to drive your squads’ KPIs, you can propose changes.

      * For Consumer Core, we can create a single plan for the whole tribe

* Engineering Leads: Stick to "T-Shirt Sizing" for now. Do not spend time on detailed engineering estimation yet.

* Everyone: Plan Bottom-Up.

   * The Meta Backlog for Q1 isn’t finalized yet. For now, assume you can build your roadmap based on the domain objectives, squad KPIs, and the YP. We’ll adjust for top-down Meta Backlog items once they’re published.

We’re looking to keep this lightweight and focused on outcomes. More details to follow by the end of the week. As always, thanks for your understanding while we go through this transition

	Status

	In Progress

	Background:

HelloFresh and Factor have invested in launching a range of Private Label shots and juices in Europe, with Factor also planning to launch protein shakes and electrolyte drinks soon. This portfolio of relevant, innovative and exciting products will strengthen our brand, drive net AOV and unlock incremental value in the Free for Life and Loyalty Programs. 

While the current juice and shot portfolios are available for HF and F-EU customers in NL and FR, they are yet not available in DACH and NOR due to the complex Pfand (deposit) requirements.

To launch any beverage in DACH and the Nordics (DK,SE, NO), we must meet 3 requirements:

1. Register with local regulatory agencies (completed)

2. Set up a local bottle deposit scheme (completed) 

3. Meet the minimum legal require

4. ments on our website and app, by clearly stating the relevant refund amount whenever a product is being ordered 

   * More specifically, the "Pfand" amount (e.g., "Pfand Amount x 0.25 EUR") must be declared expressly and separately in an additional line, not as "other charges." We also need to clearly display the individual costs for the customer, showing how much of the €0.25 is being charged (e.g., 1x, 2x, etc.). (more details below)

The first two requirements have been met. However the third requirement cannot be fulfilled with our current platform and requires tech support to drive the necessary UI and backend integration. Without this tech integration, the launch of all beverages > 100ml in DACH (as paid and FFL add-ons) is completely blocked, and puts the launch in the Nordics and IE in a grey area.

Solution needed: 

In summary, we must clearly display the deposit (Pfand) collected for all beverages purchased by the customer in the "Order Overview" step on the checkout funnel, and ideally in the invoice too. 

More specifically, the key change required is to add a new line within the 'order overview' section, located  on the right side of the screen,  clearly displaying the pfand amount and number of pfand's charged. For instance, if a product comprises a bundle of 3 bottles, it must state “3 x pfand”alongside the corresponding monetary value  (see picture below)





  











Questions to be clarified: 

* Does the €0.25 charge for a single-use bottle change market-to-market? 

Yes, the exact deposit amount changes market by market. 

Different sizes of the bottle could have a different price as well (recipe-dependent). 

* What is the exact name/translation for the "Pfand" charge for each of the three markets?        

The “Pfand” is the German translation of ”Deposit”. The name will need to be translated in all markets.

* Is it a definitive legal requirement to show the "Pfand" charge as a separate line item in the add-on section, or can it be omitted there?        

It is a must-have requirement to display a separate line item in both the Add-on and Order-summary due to legal requirements. 

   * If a customer orders multiple different juice/shot packs, can we show just one single collated line item for the total "Deposit" charge?

Confirmed. Example: h

	1x Recipe A: 3x ginger shots



	1x Recipe A: base price €5.99



3x Pfand: (corresponding to the n. of units in the recipe) €0.75

	1 Hellofresh Market product €5.99





Total pfand: 

3x units (0.25) = €0.75

	1x Recipe A: 3x ginger shots

1x Recipe B: 5x Shot variety pack (3x ginger, 2x turmeric)



	1x Recipe A: base price €5.99

1x Recipe B: base price €8.99



8x Pfand: €2.00[a]

	2x Hellofresh Market product €14.98





Total pfand: 

8x units (0.25) = €2.00

	2x Recipe A: 3x ginger shots





	2x Recipe A: base price €11.98



6x Pfand: €1.50

	2x Hellofresh Market product €11.98





Total pfand: €1.50

	





[a]@sameer.doda@hellofresh.ca

Good news on the single line item in the add-ons section. 

We cannot omit it, but it can be aggregated as long as we show the exact units of pfand as in the order summary. 





Please let me know if I've answered all your questions and thanks again for the support!

   * Playbook documentation will be standardized, archived in a crawlable manner for our AI enabled Marketing skill base

   * Best practices will be shared more pro-actively, and our tools will help us identify where learnings from one market could lift another in the portfolio

   * Shift human focus from repetitive tasks to brand building, provocative storytelling, and cultural engagement

3. Industrialize Creative Production (also covered in DOs 1 and 2)

   * Transform creative into a high-velocity system, where automation and AI accelerate asset generation, adaptation, and testing across formats.

🛣️ Q2+Q3 Roadmap

Solenne, Ahmed, Tobias and I sat down and put our planned projects into a roadmap for Q2 and Q3. Tobias and Solenne presented this roadmap to Yoav and Annie and received good feedback about it. In the second tab of the spreadsheet we listed the priorities, with Porterhouse leading the list. Whenever we have to make a hard choice between two deliveries, we will decide for the one with the higher priority. That makes projects with lower priority more likely to be delayed than the ones with higher priority. If you have any concern of a high-priority project, please let Tobias and Solenne know as soon as possible.

💻 Tech Initiatives

                                                                                                                                    * The BFF migration in the mobile app is almost almost almost complete. We can expect the initiative to be complete early next week. There are still some cleaning up to do on web and mobile.

                                                                                                                                    * Last week we implemented a proof of concept of how we can migrate route access control to react components, and this we started with the migration of the access control function for the Cancellation page. By the end of next week, we should have also migrated the Delivery Tracking and RaF routes.

💸 Additional Vouchers

One of Engagement's sprint goals is to support Additional Vouchers in our price calculation logic for web and mobile. This week we started working on the website, refactoring the voucher Redux logic (🍝) and implementing the action to fetch a subscription's additional voucher info.

🔪 Killing Alice

This week we removed the last API call to Alice: update payment method in web. Before Alice is really killed in Intfood (expected mid April), we will need to do a force update of our mobile app to prevent users from using old versions that are still using the old endpoints.

🛒 Add-ons

The Happiness team started to implement some changes for Add-Ons, and was able to setup some add-ons SKUs in staging.

Nikita / Prateek (Deep Dive)

Invited Nikita Gorshkov Prateek Jajoo

Attachments Nikita / Prateek (Deep Dive) 

Meeting records Recording 





Summary

Nikita Gorshkov and Prateek Jajoo discussed content strategy and app development, acknowledging a weak history in content but recognizing the potential of an app to measure and communicate pet health improvements to users, with the goal of improving social proof and retention. They agreed on the need to define the smallest possible product and to test ideas by understanding pet owners' top worries through a survey, which Nikita Gorshkov confirmed the commercial team can easily incorporate into existing surveys. Prateek Jajoo inquired about the power user demographics, whom Nikita Gorshkov identified as "dinks" in metro areas, with high annual spending on their pets.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Content Strategy and App Development Nikita Gorshkov noted the company's weak history in content strategies and daily active user increases, which makes them cautious about investing heavily in content, despite recognizing the interest. They suggested finding easy ways to show users that their products improve pet health, which can then be used as social proof on the website. Prateek Jajoo connected this idea to the potential basis for a pet app, which Nikita Gorshkov affirmed could be a strong idea.

* Testing Ideas and Customer Concerns Nikita Gorshkov emphasized the need to define the smallest possible product and, more importantly, to test interesting ideas to build confidence before committing significant resources. Prateek Jajoo suggested understanding the top five worries or thoughts a pet owner has about their pet to ensure that any app features or solutions address what customers truly care about, thus driving daily usage and engagement. Nikita Gorshkov agreed that providing basic tracking capabilities should be offered not only to active customers but potentially to any pet owners who download the app.

* Surveying Pet Owners To understand customer thoughts, Prateek Jajoo suggested running a survey. Nikita Gorshkov confirmed that the commercial team already runs a survey every two weeks or monthly, and it would be easy to add additional questions due to a good response rate. They shared the contact of Lindsay within the TPT team, who typically runs these in-depth surveys, and offered to add Prateek Jajoo for visibility, mentioning that the latest one they had access to was from August.

* Target Customer Demographics and Spending Prateek Jajoo inquired about the demographics of the power user customer. Nikita Gorshkov identified the power users as "dinks" (Dual Income, No Kids) in metro areas, who have the time, energy, and desire to pamper their pets with fresh frozen food, considering the increase in dog ownership and the perception of pets as children. Nikita Gorshkov noted that the average spend in the US per dog is $1.6k per year, emphasizing that this is a lot of money and the highest amount globally.

* Customer Connection and Health Measurement Prateek Jajoo discussed the emotional attachment and time spent with a dog, suggesting owners would notice improvements in health or appearance, but proposed that the company should help measure and communicate those improvements rather than waiting for the customer to figure it out. Nikita Gorshkov agreed with the sentiment and suggested that Prateek Jajoo speak with Yara, who owns a dog named Boba and represents a good middle ground for their target audience, as she ensures their pet is healthy and happy. Prateek Jajoo connected this idea of measuring and communicating health improvements to solving the retention problem, comparing it to the high utility of services like Amazon Prime.

* Next Steps and Design Bandwidth Prateek Jajoo stated that they would start working on the login page and write a one-pager for review to plan stage one and stage two for a quick win within one sprint. Prateek Jajoo expressed concern about Katrina's bandwidth for the design work. Nikita Gorshkov confirmed they are working to ensure Katrina has the necessary bandwidth and is pushing back on distractions from their senior director.





Suggested next steps

* Prateek Jajoo will start work on the login page and write a one-pager to review and make stage one and stage two plans for a quick win within one sprint.

* Nikita Gorshkov will help Prateek Jajoo navigate where to find the survey and related information by sending the contact for Lindsay and adding Prateek Jajoo to the TPT team for visibility on the surveys.

* Prateek Jajoo will work with the designer Katrina to ensure the right questions are being asked in the survey to get the right information.

* Nikita Gorshkov will ensure that Katrina has the bandwidth for the design work.

Problem Statement

Social media has become a primary hub for culinary inspiration, where people turn to influencers to discover new recipes. While Followers struggle to find the necessary ingredients and an easy way to re-cook them, Influencers look for new revenue streams to be more independent from the heavily controlled platforms and find new ways to expand their reach and engage with their audiences authentically and organically via food.





Opportunity:

Hellofresh sees a huge opportunity to serve both: by transforming influencers' inspiration (recipe) into a shoppable, cookable meal kit for the consumers. 

By bridging the gap as the Expert in operation, warehouses and logistics, we provide customers a way to enjoy these recipes easily and the influencer to serve their followers and create a new revenue stream. The social commerce market is growing rapidly and can represent a huge opportunity for us to attract new customers.





Why now:

We see the urgency to act now, because influencers are already trying to solve this problem with links to ingredient orders  via Instacart or Pinterest partners with Instacart to enable 1-click grocery list generation from saved pins. But today, shoppable content on social media within the food category is often limited to individual food items as opposed to a holistic offering where the ingredients for entire recipes and direct delivery can be purchased. 





The Core Ask 

WBD: Influencer Marketplace

Explore desired and viable vision for a curated recipe creator marketplace (1. influencer, 2. Aggregators) with the option of an  instant purchase as a meal kit ‘fulfilled by HelloFresh’.





Long-term Vision (Later) 

Transform HelloFresh into the “Spotify for food”  a platform where any creator can share a recipe that HelloFresh fulfills.

Meeting records Transcript Recording 





Summary

Annette MvdE led the meeting, focusing on the status of creator research, the plan for customer validation, and a critique of the validation prototype with Ian Brooks, Katheryn Eckles, Melanie Schwindt, Linnea Siersma, Sameer Doda, and Cole Banning participating. Katheryn Eckles reported on five creator interviews, with upcoming research moving into concept validation and a customer interview phase to understand the inspiration execution gap, marketplace value, and trust barriers. Participants discussed pricing models, with Ian Brooks and Linnea Siersma favoring a model where creators set their own margin, while Sameer Doda proposed a tiered, cost-plus approach, and Annette MvdE confirmed that the concept validation prototype will use a pitch deck to guide conversation and feature critique.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Meeting Context and Agenda Annette MvdE initiated the meeting, sharing the document link and planning to screen-share (00:00:00). The agenda focused on the status of creator research, the plan for the next customer validation round, and a prototype critique for the validation test (00:01:04). The goal was to cover everything in 60 minutes, though Ian Brooks noted they would try to keep their participation to 45 minutes (00:00:00).

* Creator Research Status Katheryn Eckles reported five creator interviews completed, covering a mix of creator sizes up to 1.2 million followers, with generally consistent insights (00:01:56). They found that one cookbook author saw no conflict in using their cookbook recipes on the platform for exposure and was aligned with commission-based compensation. The research is transitioning to focus on cookbook authors and higher-level influencers, probing deeper into their use of trends and vetting expectations (00:03:06).

* Creator Vetting and Data Needs The cookbook author interviewed acknowledged that customers might not fully understand if HelloFresh is not vetting recipes in an Amazon-style marketplace approach and might still blame the platform or the creator for bad recipes (00:04:20). Creators are interested in data points such as user interests, popular ingredients, cooking time, and site traffic (00:05:29).

* Concept Validation and Next Steps for Creator Research Katheryn Eckles stated that the interviews are moving into concept validation next week to obtain deeper insights into how creators see the platform working (00:05:29). The expected outcomes include stronger indicators of desirability and feature prioritization (00:07:34). Recruitment is ongoing, focusing on larger influencers, with the option to re-engage previous participants (00:06:32).

* Customer Research Plan The next phase of research will focus on customer interviews, building on signals from unmoderated tests and a survey that showed a significant inspiration execution gap (00:07:34). The goal is to understand how customers would use the service (e.g., for special occasions or daily purchases), the perceived value and trust in the influencer marketplace, and their needs and barriers related to trust and quality (00:08:49).

* Customer Research Methodology and Focus The customer interviews will involve HelloFresh prospects actively engaging with food content on social media, using

siness like the business perspective comes in here as well for this plan. Yes.

Katheryn Eckles: Yeah. Um, I just want to jump in and say, um, with like upcoming research, especially as you're kind of like getting clear on like your strategy and the questions that kind of come up there, um, there might be like often we make like prioritization decisions and things like that based off of like how much work is needed in a space. So, if you guys become clear on like, oh, we need testing on all of these things, we need clarity on this, that, and this.

 

 

01:09:36

 

Katheryn Eckles: um we're going in this direction and we have no idea in terms of research. There might also be things where maybe Anetta is done with the strategy bits of things, but I stay on as the researcher helping you research these things for a little bit longer. So there's there's things that might happen in that context as well. Um where we can potentially still support, but I think a lot of the decisions on our team tend to be made based off of like um the clear need in in that space. So, um, if if you kind of have your strategy decisions and you're communicating with us of like, okay, this is where we're going, and then we can inform you, okay, we don't have, you know, clarity on these parts, those parts, and those parts. Do you want research on that? And then we can work together and kind of figure out what um kind of research is needed. And then we can bring that to Mark and and Andrea and and try to advocate for me staying on a little bit longer to help um kind of derisk this.

Annette MvdE: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

Katheryn Eckles: So,

Annette MvdE: Uh I don't want like I I'm not ending this project and saying like goodbye and leaving you with this. we will find solutions especially when you're reaching out and saying like we want these tests because as I said like at the moment in Berlin the new way is just roll out each week new things not testing them before or exploring them and here it was a little bit different but I feel also like talking to a lot of you you have actually like your desire is like to get more clarity on here and do maybe more testing and if this is um if this is okay with Mar and um Andrea

﻿TPT Jira || TPT Backlog || TPT Product Launch Calendar 2024 || Design Masterfile || Sprig || Scope Proposal: External Engineering Augmentation for The Pets Table (TPT)

Roadmap - The Pets Table (2026)





* Total Price communication (taxes + discount) 

Dec 2, 2025 | The Pets Table weekly Check-in

Attendees: Maria Chelminska Anisha Chandra Laurent Guillemain Ahmed Wagdi Dovas Zakas Pedro Ávila Rena Zhou Daniel Arias Prateek Jajoo Désirée Lima Nikita Gorshkov





Action items from last time

* Ahmed Wagdito confirm if C@C can be enabled for reactivation

   * GoC started rollout 

   * Planned incremental rollout in TPT this sprint 

   * Keep Mitali Gadekarin the loop 

* Ahmed Wagdito align with Daniel about contractor budget for 2026

* Maria and Anisha to align on plans available for the new the calorie ranges 

   * <53  - no plan

   * Between 54-87 - offer only 100% airdried plan.

   * Between 88-149 - offer only 100% plan for dry and fresh

   * Between 150-225 - offer 100% and 75% plan for dry and fresh

   * 226+ - offer mixed plan + 50% and 100% percentages for dry and fresh





  











* Ahmed Wagdito dive deeper into rescheduling including the delivery day change 





Notes

* “Recipe” instead of meals 

   * Impact on CRM 

   * What about existing “recipe” mentions in the active experience?





  



* Sprig (ask for access via #sprig-hellofresh)





Action items

* Maria to share with Suzi: 

   * All new SKUs should be added to the Adjust daily calories

* Ahmed Wagdito dive deeper into rescheduling including the delivery day change 

* Maria and Prateek to change the copy in the funnel and active experience from “meal” to “recipe” 

* Maria to follow up with the PA team regarding reactivation rate reporting

* Ahmed Wagdito manage the incremental 









Nov 26, 2025 | The Pets Table weekly Check-in

Attendees: Maria Chelminska Anisha Chandra Laurent Guillemain Ahmed Wagdi Nikita Gorshkov Daniel Arias Désirée Lima Dovas Zakas Pedro Ávila Rena Zhou









Action items from last time

* Ahmed Wagdi to share screenshots with Anisha of Project Heaven 

* Ahmed Wagdito confirm if C@C can be enabled for reactivation

* Ahmed Wagdito align with Daniel about contractor budget for 2026





Notes

* Different portion % in multipet 

   * Which variation to show - variation C (without defaulting)

* Naming convention: EasyFresh / Fresh Frozen - is this confirmed?

   * Likely, but check again

* Roadmap update

   * Anisha’s request - expanding SKU pool

      * Take out RAF work 

   * Feeding Guideline update (can align with portion % launch)

      * PDFs to be provided by the 19th of December by Jasmine Atkinson

   * Rescheduling delivery date triggering moving delivery day

* New contact us page, legal topic risk

* Rescheduling discussion 

   * Problem: When rescheduling through the calendar, if the user doesn’t just shift weak but also picks a different delivery day, most users expect the delivery day change to reflect in all future deliveries (E.g. if you change to a Friday, all future deliveries should be on a Friday) but the delivery day change is just a one-off for that week. This also could cause our users to not have the right amount of food between each delivery.

   * Proposed Solution: When user updates their delivery day on the calendar, we should update all future deliveries as well to use the new delivery day

   * There are complications with the proposed solution:

      * If we change the user’s delivery day in general, it will not only affect the deliveries starting from the week that

e're trying to address this for the VMS experience and working with Gabi and Ryan to get a clearer setup for attribution and tracking in cases of multisubscription users.

[w]@nikita.gorshkov@hellofresh.com to talk to @mateusz.borowiak@hellofresh.com

[x]Note for Self: they are modifying the conversion event.

[y]@aw@hellofresh.com

[z]@lgui@hellofresh.com FYI for updates

[aa]Replied under each question

[ab]Thansk Ahmed!

[ac]notes! please add anything I've missed @lgui@hellofresh.co.uk @wellney.yarra@hellofresh.com @anisha.chandra@hellofresh.com @aw@hellofresh.com

[ad]https://hellofresh.atlassian.net/browse/TPT-480

[ae]@anisha.chandra@hellofresh.com do you agree this is the right statement for AAFCO?





@dovas@hellofresh.com FYI

_Assigned to anisha.chandra@hellofresh.com_

[af]This is the official statement "formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the

AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials) Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for All Life Stages, including growth of large size dogs (70 lbs. or more as an adult)"

[ag]If we need shorter, then I'm ok shortening to what NOM Nom have in their FAQ which is "Recipes meet standards set by AAFCO’s Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for all life stages."

[ah]@wellney.yarra@hellofresh.com - does it all go through you, or we can also add tix?

[ai]should we move the existing UI fix tickets to this epic?

[aj]@bowang.dai@hellofresh.ca have you had a chance to check this one?

_Assigned to _

[ak]Sorry, didn't get a chance to speak to this yesterday! Yes! I have reach out to squad consumer core. They have updated the reporting tab is no longer a supported feature. They only way to see recent conversions is via the DWH.

[al]I am currently reaching out to global BI to see how this information is pulled from DWH and which report pulls this information.

[am]FYI @dovas@hellofresh.com 





Thanks Bo!!

[an]gotcha - thanks you. maybe you can check if we can use "marketing report extract" from tableau?

[ao]Sorry team for missing this meeting as I was off. @dovas@hellofresh.com and @wellney.yarra@hellofresh.com is this the finalized RAF Values? 50% off the trial box and 20% off on the next two boxes? Is this correct?

[ap]Hey! Nope these were just example of the first box discount. For RAF it will be 100% off trial box, just pay for shipping and a TBD credit customer will earn for successful referrals

New Ventures Operational Overhead calculation



"How it works

This sheet provides the percentage of operational overhead (i.e. KTLO work per month). Each team has a dedicated tab. For this to work, you need to
* add the label KTLO to all Jira tickets that you consider KTLO work
* Make sure all tickets that move into the “resolved” state have assigned story points. Add the actual story point in hindsight for accurate operational overhead calculation
A cron job runs every night and updates this sheet. It used the resolved date to include a ticket in the calculation for a specific month.

----------------------------------------

,,

,Plan,Pricing Principles at Launch

,All,Max box price should be $250 

,Fresh/Topper/Mixed,Max freezer fill is 1/3 a small NYC apt freezer

,Fresh,Aim to price lower than TFD but only if we can make PC2 margins and economics work

,All,Charge shipping separate to box price

,All,Shipping free in first order

,All,Price per day for trial is same as for regular box before discount

,All,Price per lb does not need to decrease as calories increase within same plan although it should go in that general direction

,All,"If we ship the same amount of product, the price should be the same"

,,

,Step,Description

,1: Import costs,All costs by plan imported into pricing file

,2: Benchmark,Competitors benchmarked to build up their pricing curves

,3: Scenarios,"High level pricing scenarios chosen per plan - final scenarios chosen:
- Fresh: Match TFD prices excluding shipping fee. Fresh is headline price to fix rest to
- Mixed: Should be 5-15% below Fresh depending on size and margins
- Topper: Should be 55-62.5% of Fresh price for 50% of product depending on size and margins
- Dry: Should be lowest price and price at 38% margins"

,4: Smooth pricing,Scenarios lead to choppy pricing. This was then smoothed

,5: Check PC2 / ROIs,PC2 and ROI reviewed to increase prices and improve margins where they were low

,6: Make steps,"If giving the same qty of product for 2 or more different SKUs, the prices were matched to create some stepped pricing"

,,

,,

,Type,Elements to Change in Price Test

,Architecture issue,Ensure same amount of food in box is always the same price

,Architecture issue,Review price per Lb curves i.e. price per LB should go down as calories increase

,Architecture issue,Review PC2 margins by calories within plan; and PC2 margins across calories

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Air Dried price to have lower entry price point to increase TAM

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Fresh price to be more competitive with Farmers Dog & Ollie

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Mixed price to sit in appropriate area between Fresh & Air Dried (being wary where Pantry Fresh would be)

,Architecture issue,"Lower price for larger dogs more than smaller dogs to encourage share of larger, higher ROI dogs"

Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

The session, attended by Travis Provick, Nikita Gorshkov, Sergei Kuzmenko, Leo Lee, Evan, Hoga, Talis, Adam, Mark, Tommaso, Fiona, and Tessa, focused on a bottom-up planning exercise for the tribe to prioritize initiatives, flag risks, and identify cross-team support needs, utilizing an interactive color-coded sheet to assess priority and confidence levels for Q1 deliverables. Key discussions involved the shift to React Native, Appio deprecation, the high priority of multi-region readiness for Project 500, and the need to prioritize Snowplow implementation for personalization signals, which currently lacks ownership despite being a blocker for meta backlog items. Critical items requiring further scoping and dependency management include the scalable food profile architecture and a long-term solution for the seamless downgrade issue, which is the highest priority for the merchandising team.





Details

Notes Length: Long

* Initial check-in and process overview: Travis Provick mentioned that "the keys are good," followed by greetings from Nikita Gorshkov, Sergei Kuzmenko, and someone in BER - R16-L0-Parterre (Berlin Campus - Ritterstraße, L0). Someone in BER - R16-L0-Parterre (Berlin Campus - Ritterstraße, L0) noted that a participant was previously on a different Zoom link (00:00:00). Someone in BER - R16-L0-Parterre (Berlin Campus - Ritterstraße, L0) ensured everyone could hear well, receiving confirmation from Nikita Gorshkov. Someone in BER - R16-L0-Parterre (Berlin Campus - Ritterstraße, L0) addressed Leo Lee regarding covering material, possibly for foundations, as Fernando was absent, and mentioned having a plan for customer service, to which Leo Lee confirmed having things ready with a slight exception concerning personalization, which they could discuss later. Someone in BER - R16-L0-Parterre (Berlin Campus - Ritterstraße, L0) clarified that the session was part of a new process, previously discussed in a leadership meeting, and the goal was to "figure things out together," "try it," "do it," and then "learn from it, improve it next time" (00:00:00). Someone in BER - R16-L0-Parterre (Berlin Campus - Ritterstraße, L0) asked if everyone had reviewed the agenda, suggesting that if not, they should take five minutes to review it to ensure clarity on the main goals for the day. The agenda was posted in the LT channel and re-posted by Evan. Someone in BER - R16-L0-Parterre (Berlin Campus - Ritterstraße, L0) expressed confidence in achieving nice outcomes and working towards a committed plan, noting that participants had mostly worked within the squads previously (00:04:45).

* Bottom-up planning and expectations at the tribe level: someone in BER - R16-L0-Parterre (Berlin Campus - Ritterstraße, L0) explained that the session was a "bottom up planning exercise" being lifted to the tribe level. Someone in BER - R16-L0-Parterre (Berlin Campus - Ritterstraße, L0) emphasized that at this higher level, it is expected "that we're not discuss any minuscule thing," urging participants to apply their judgment on what is valuable for the group to discuss. The objectives include understa

y, we said the goal was to have something we could share with us tomorrow. Are we still aiming for that? So, we don't have to share tomorrow because he's going to be on a plane. Yeah. But we'll share the weekend. Exactly. Um the plan was to share something. Um when do we have the Hello Tech uh the essential functions meeting on Tuesday?

 

 

03:31:10

 

BER - R16-L0-Parterre (Berlin Campus - Ritterstraße, L0): So my understanding is right now we have until Tuesday and the main deliverable at this point would be the um updated version of the yearly plan that Leo just referenced. So what are the top things that we used that we highlighted and then what are the top things that have now changed based on the exercises that we did bottom up. We still have this disclaimer that this is a bit of an exotic quarter because remember normally we would have started with the meta backlog. So we have to figure out how we now sync the top down and the bottom up planning. But since we have on raph and some of the items uh already uh discussed within I don't expect any large changes or surprises from the final sign off of the meta back and um for this updated version of the table of top deliverables is still going to be quarterly granularity or are we going to do monthly like we previously talked about?

 

 

03:32:14

 

BER - R16-L0-Parterre (Berlin Campus - Ritterstraße, L0): I don't know Hogan you went that session I wasn't there I was on vacation. Uh I I think I I understood monthsly. That's what we had been saying. So if that's the case, maybe just after this we can we can create a template because the granularity was a little bit all over the place from team to team. I didn't say anything to people because I wanted to wait for this. Yeah, let's agree maybe on what the looks like and then we'll share that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Great. Then thanks for everybody. Thank you. Three and a half hours. Well done. And uh we almost have the plan. Let's pull it together and we'll share the template in the instructions. Thanks for figuring it out. Bye. One thing that this exercise doesn't show us is how confident you are about the KTLO assumptions of each team. You have to somehow do that. So really Mhm. Yeah.

	What do we need feedback on?

* Open questions for later

* … 

	Background & Operating Model Evolution

and how we plan to use that to set our strategic objectives for YP2025 & beyond…

Purpose of document

In this document we at tempt to provide a high-level overview of the current tribe, its domains, operating model and challenges. We use those inputs along with the help of a bit of refinement of our operating model and introducing a bit of terminology to help us steer our focus for key investments for 2025. This doesn’t serve as a replacement for the YP2025 but rather as a strategic starting point to help us align within our tribe & externally with our stakeholders on (a) our ambition, priority and appetite across our owned domains, as well as (b) use this is as a chance to refine our mission, vision and operating model for the tribe as we head in 2025 & beyond. 

Current Structure & Domains (Platforms) Owned

🔬Vision ⇒ "Core actions" can be completed at all times, quickly and with minimal frustration, even as HelloFresh's business grows.

Core actions: log in, register account, save address, activate/reactivate/cancel plan, calculate price, place order, manage delivery plan, manage/schedule delivery

🎯Mission ⇒ Build a reliable, high-performing and scalable backend to power HelloFresh’s core actions.

Domains we own ⇒ customer authentication, customer account management, customer address, subscription, order, deliveries, delivery plan and price calculation; we also maintain Intfood (“Bob”) and API-v2

  



Operating Model

Is there any additional context I need to be aware of to help me better understand the operating model?

Consumer Core, operating as a backend-only tribe, is responsible for the invisible yet critical processes and systems powering HelloFresh's customer experience. Our current architecture, mostly based on legacy monoliths (Bob, API-v2, Intfood) and databases, while functional, limits our ability to rapidly innovate and scale. The complexity of the existing codebase and the shared database structure pose significant challenges to both development agility (27% lower LTTC than other services when working on the monoliths), system performance (TTR for monoliths is at 138 min vs. 97 min for other services) and minimizing our security risks (TK CVEs that can’t be addressed due to X)[a] [source].





As we modernize, we must support both legacy and new systems simultaneously. This dual support significantly increases our KTLO (Keep The Lights On) workload beyond allocated resources (30~50% sprint over sprint average goal miss-rate), frequent timeline shifts and increased legacy system incidents & issues. These factors often slow our modernization efforts, as we sometimes need to prioritize short-term gains (e.g. Project Bolt, Next Day Delivery Activations UK Launch, Free Breakfast for Life) over long-term improvements. Balancing immediate business needs with strategic modernization remains a key challenge, underscoring the urgency of our initiatives to streamline and update our systems.

 add strategies in incremental – that says like some fraud prevention enhancements with problems to be solved

[bd]Added this for discussion





How are we making sure we have clients aligned to start consuming newer APIs like Plans API instead of subscription API from legacy systems.

[be]@adam.ghanem@hellofresh.com to update after:

1. Scorecards of status quo established

2. Gap analysis

3. Target maturity for 2025 established based on YP exercise

_Assigned to adam.ghanem@hellofresh.com_

[bf]this already exist

[bg]Can you expand on what you mean here by this?





In my mind here, I am referring to the ability for a customer to be able to:

1. Schedule an ad-hoc order delivery

2. Select meals for that delivery





This will allow customers to either:

1. Place one time orders whenever they'd like

2. Place and schedule one time orders throughout the week as well

[bh]@ahus@hellofresh.com while we wait for your answer, I assume that what is currently supported is to  create an order without a subscription, and what Adam is referring to would add a new delivery to an existing subscription. 

Is that the case?

[bi]@adam.ghanem@hellofresh.com what is the difference between placing an order whenever they'd like and throughout the week? (1 and 2?)

[bj]I just mentioned it here for now based on little input I got from Augusto so that we just don’t forget about it. 





I believe the mapping exercise you have scheduled for tomorrow would clarify _some_ of the ambiguity here of the necessary capabilities :) so would hold off any technical analysis needed at this point & see after tomorrow’s workshop how best for articulate this

[bk]For context, the original idea that Augusto mentioned is being able to have multiple deliveries scheduled automatically in a week

[bl]Shouldn't this be a pricing strategy that has a dependency on the subscription/plans domain?

[bm]Pricing the subscription is – the ability to build a subscription using building blocks is a "subscriptions" domain concern – this is still open for discussion though and still early here

[bn]@ahus@hellofresh.com the starting point or need is pricing monetization driven -- we can discuss which team is more suited to build this.

[bo]who are consumers of this?

[bp]I am just putting it as a placeholder here – I am not sure if this is something that was ever done before but not sure who should do it

Summary



Ian Brooks and Nikita Gorshkov discussed the challenges of poor  

personalization, including menu repeats, resulting from the current  

recommendation engine, which Ian Brooks suggested requires a UX overhaul  

using a more food-based, "restaurant"-style approach for "total choice for  

chef's plate" implementation. Nikita Gorshkov confirmed the leadership for  

the creator platform/marketplace will be Lineia Serisma for product  

strategy, Cole Banning for growth, and Melanie Schmidt for project  

management, with an MVP focused on simple, occasion-based boxes for one-off  

purchases via social media. They also addressed the organization of Market  

Innovation, with Nikita Gorshkov proposing a new prioritization structure,  

and Ian Brooks agreeing to serve as the delegate for international markets  

while emphasizing the need for guardrails to mitigate US market dominance  

in resource allocation.





Suggested next steps





Ian Brooks will send the three videos about the menu personalization issues  

to Nikita Gorshkov.



Nikita Gorshkov will circle back to Lineia Serisma and Cole Banning to  

discuss the sales and outreach program for the creator platform.



Nikita Gorshkov will consolidate a proposal on how the input of new items  

will work for the market innovation and optimization squad.

Summary



Sameer Doda confirmed that the overall work volume is manageable, with  

Allison assisting on the platform and Good Chop Shopify projects, though  

Sameer Doda and Nikita Gorshkov noted that program revivals are unlikely  

due to a lack of resources, a point Sameer Doda, David, and Nikita Gorshkov  

discussed with Marina regarding unfunded work. Sameer Doda detailed their  

involvement in the complex Good Chop Shopify project, the DACH Juices  

support project for Nordic markets that requires a technical solution, and  

the Influencer Marketplace, which needs an MVP path forward due to varied  

stakeholder views and already has design progress with Shay; Sameer Doda  

and Nikita Gorshkov agreed on a simple one-time purchase customer journey  

for the MVP, but Sameer Doda raised concerns about limitations with  

applying vouchers and selling add-ons, which Nikita Gorshkov suggested  

discussing with Jama, and both acknowledged a need for more frontend  

development resources. Sameer Doda needs to coordinate with Jama for the  

roadmap review meeting and discussed the "Seamless Pricing Upgrade"  

initiative, which Nikita Gorshkov suggested de-prioritizing, while they  

also agreed to maintain two different views of the roadmap and im

ace.



Sameer Doda will go through the answers received from Viola regarding the  

duck juices support and create a requirements document, including an  

estimate for when the work will be picked up in Q1.



Sameer Doda will set up a session next week with Nikita Gorshkov and Shay  

to (1) review the basic customer journey for the onetime purchase flow and  

the low fidelity designs for the influencer marketplace, and (2) work with  

Shay to iron out changes needed on the low fidelity designs so Shay can  

continue working on the high fidelity designs.



Sameer Doda and Nikita Gorshkov will connect with Jamba on Monday to  

discuss the roadmap review meeting with stakeholders and determine the  

invitees.

Notes from “Nikita / Prateek (Deep Dive)”



These notes have been sent to invited guests in your organization.



Open meeting notes



The content was auto-generated on December 5, 2025, 1:36 PM CET and may  

contain errors.





Summary



Nikita Gorshkov and Prateek Jajoo discussed content strategy and app  

development, acknowledging a weak history in content but recognizing the  

potential of an app to measure and communicate pet health improvements to  

users, with the goal of improving social proof and retention. They agreed  

on the need to define the smallest possible product and to test ideas by  

understanding pet owners' top worries through a survey, which Nikita  

Gorshkov confirmed the commercial team can easily incorporate into existing  

surveys. Prateek Jajoo inquired about the power user demographics, whom  

Nikita Gorshkov identified as "dinks" in metro areas, with high annual  

spending on their pets.





Suggested next steps





Prateek Jajoo will start work on the login page and write a one-pager to  

review and make stage one and stage two plans for a quick win within one  

sprint.



Nikita Gorshkov will help Prateek Jajoo navigate where to find the survey  

and related information by sending the contact for Lindsay and adding  

Prateek Jajoo to the TPT team for visibility on the surveys.



Prateek Jajoo will work with the designer Katrina to ensure the right  

questions are being asked in the survey to get the right information.



Nikita Gorshkov will ensure that Katrina has the bandwidth for the design  

work.

Summary



The session, attended by Travis Provick, Nikita Gorshkov, Sergei Kuzmenko,  

Leo Lee, Evan, Hoga, Talis, Adam, Mark, Tommaso, Fiona, and Tessa, focused  

on a bottom-up planning exercise for the tribe to prioritize initiatives,  

flag risks, and identify cross-team support needs, utilizing an interactive  

color-coded sheet to assess priority and confidence levels for Q1  

deliverables. Key discussions involved the shift to React Native, Appio  

deprecation, the high priority of multi-region readiness for Project 500,  

and the need to prioritize Snowplow implementation for personalization  

signals, which currently lacks ownership despite being a blocker for meta  

backlog items. Critical items requiring further scoping and dependency  

management include the scalable food profile architecture and a long-term  

solution for the seamless downgrade issue, which is the highest priority  

for the merchandising team.

The group will figure out what the template for the updated yearly plan  

looks like and then share it.
