Meeting records Transcript File 





Summary

Prateek Jajoo experienced a Confluence page access issue, which was resolved by Nikita Gorshkov granting access to anonymous users, who also clarified the meeting's purpose is for Prateek Jajoo’s personal development, unblocking, and issue escalation, asking them to manage ETAs for the login page and app documentation. Prateek Jajoo updated on prioritizing login page features like text box visibility and language enhancement for conversion before Katrina's absence, seeking reviews from Nikita Gorshkov and Laura Doas this week, and also discussed deprioritizing social logins while raising concerns about the lack of recipe selection transparency on the checkout page, which Nikita Gorshkov agreed to test if inexpensive. Additionally, Prateek Jajoo sought clarity on the design review process with Laura Doas, with Nikita Gorshkov advising to consult Maria about the TPT experience preview or set up a separate small design review.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Access to Confluence Page Prateek Jajoo reported difficulty accessing the new tribe in Slide page on Confluence despite receiving an email confirming access (00:00:00). Nikita Gorshkov resolved the issue by granting access to anonymous users, which Prateek Jajoo found to be a "big relief" (00:01:13).

* Personal Development and Project Management Nikita Gorshkov clarified that the purpose of their standing meeting is to discuss Prateek Jajoo’s personal development, unblock them, and escalate issues. They requested Prateek Jajoo to manage expectations regarding the ETA for work on the login page and the app documentation and plan (00:03:09).

* Login Page Feature Prioritization and Review Prateek Jajoo provided an update on the login page work, focusing on frontloaded efforts due to Katrina's upcoming absence, which involved creating and prioritizing a list of features to improve conversion rates (00:04:25). The primary features prioritized for one sprint's work include improving the text box's visibility and making it more action-oriented, as well as enhancing the language's intent with emotional appeal and social proof (00:05:52). Prateek Jajoo intends to secure reviews from Nikita Gorshkov and Laura Doas this week to finalize designs before Katrina's departure, aiming for development in the second sprint (00:04:25).

* Deprioritization of Social Login and Recipe Transparency Prateek Jajoo mentioned the deprioritization of social logins, citing data from other brands and the older demographic of their customer base as factors. They are, however, deep-diving into more data and plan to detail the rationale in a one-pager. Additionally, Prateek Jajoo raised a concern about the lack of recipe selection display on the checkout or payment page, proposing that adding transparency might improve completion rates (00:09:19). Nikita Gorshkov suggested the lack of display may have been due to complexity, but agreed that testing the feature, if inexpensive, would be worthwhile, as displaying the recipes could build additional confidence for customers at the point of highest commitment (00:10:29) (00:13:43).

* Process for Design Review Prateek Jajoo sought clarity on the process for reviewing designs with the broader team, specifically requesting feedback from Laura Doas while Katrina is still available. Nikita Gorshkov advised checking with Maria about the TPT experience preview or setting up an independent small design review 

... [TRUNCATED: 12699 chars omitted to save context] ...

e customer or reduces the transparency or creates doubt kind of can lead the customer to uh not make the purchase but also we don't want to overload the customer as well. So that was a bit surprising but again I just wanted to understand the reasoning of it. So if you're right uh if it's in inexpensive maybe we can try to see if we can do right.

Nikita Gorshkov: I agree and honestly like you can display it in the sidebar and it's a feature that doesn't necessarily distract but essentially like I know the distraction argument but in this case I don't think it's necessarily applicable.

 

 

00:15:08

 

Prateek Jajoo: I think some things are expected and that expectation not meeting could lead to drop off.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah, exactly.

Prateek Jajoo: Right. Uh okay cool. Uh I'll look into it uh get more transparent in into that argument. And uh the my question is look Katrina is going I think we are already to something and I want to make sure that uh she's able to provide us her time uh this week before going but I want

Nikita Gorshkov: H. Yep.

Prateek Jajoo: to uh understand the process of how do we review or bring it to the broader team right I want uh Laura Das to give us the feedback so that any feedback could be actioned on before she goes so that we can we are good to go. Even if she doesn't have the time, we'll know what need what's the feedback.

Nikita Gorshkov: So we should be having uh so check with Maria regarding the TPT uh experience preview. Else you can set it up with Laurand Dovas etc. just on your own uh for a small design review. In some cases like in this case like it might be sufficient to have this async. So basically provide them give a justification and get their feedback that way. But if you want to do it live feel free. You also need to establish those relationships. So it's worth it uh doing it live.

Prateek Jajoo: Perfect. I'm I'm I'm anyway meeting with Doas today.

Nikita Gorshkov: Nice.

Prateek Jajoo: So I'll get some feedback and then share it with the based on uh his viewpoint either if it's very concrete and we are all aligned. Uh I can just put 30 minutes to just socialize it. It would be my first so it would be great. So yeah. Cool. Awesome.

Problem Statement

Social media has become a primary hub for culinary inspiration, where people turn to influencers to discover new recipes. While Followers struggle to find the necessary ingredients and an easy way to re-cook them, Influencers look for new revenue streams to be more independent from the heavily controlled platforms and find new ways to expand their reach and engage with their audiences authentically and organically via food.





Opportunity:

Hellofresh sees a huge opportunity to serve both: by transforming influencers' inspiration (recipe) into a shoppable, cookable meal kit for the consumers. 

By bridging the gap as the Expert in operation, warehouses and logistics, we provide customers a way to enjoy these recipes easily and the influencer to serve their followers and create a new revenue stream. The social commerce market is growing rapidly and can represent a huge opportunity for us to attract new customers.





Why now:

We see the urgency to act now, because influencers are already trying to solve this problem with links to ingredient orders  via Instacart or Pinterest partners with Instacart to enable 1-click grocery list generation from saved pins. But today, shoppable content on social media within the food category is often limited to individual food items as opposed to a holistic offering where the ingredients for entire recipes and direct delivery can be purchased. 





The Core Ask 

WBD: Influencer Marketplace

Explore desired and viable vision for a curated recipe creator marketplace (1. influencer, 2. Aggregators) with the option of an  instant purchase as a meal kit ‘fulfilled by HelloFresh’.





Long-term Vision (Later) 

Transform HelloFresh into the “Spotify for food”  a platform where any creator can share a recipe that HelloFresh fulfills.

Prototype Test

Prototype for evaluating the concept













[a]I think in the script we can keep the intro we are already using and maybe shorten the section about them and their content. I think it would be important to get some context still on their content and background but maybe we just trim that down from what we had before so it doesn't take up as much time.

[b]Do we want to continue to cover anything from the previous sessions? I think getting some more data on how they follow trends might be helpful and I do want to ask about their pricing expectations around the 'set your own price' idea. I know they said they don't need data on it, but I think it would still be helpful to gather some since we won't have many opportunities to speak with influencers.

[c]would we need to create a hellofresh shop with all influencer recipes to shop and the influencer itself advertise it?

We will invest in mitigating this impact by looking at new entry points and improved loyalty communications throughout the app experience. This will need to be done for both 2.0 and Base versions of the program, and will encompass our ringfenced 20% capacity for iunvesting in improvements in the Base version of the program",Feb,Medium ,Medium ,,"Evolve Loyalty to Reward A Long-Lasting Relationship & Engagement, Not Just Transactions",,,Communications - High Touch/Iterable (king of the hill stuff),,,,,,,,

Loyalty & Virality,E09 - Missions,"Loyalty 2.0 MVP: Milestone 1 - Point Earning & Reward Store (""Earn & Burn"")","We believe that by offering customers the ability to both earn points on their purchases and choose their preferred rewards from a catalogue, we will  increase program clarity by helping users understand what value they are earning (program clarity score), drive higher reward redemption (reward usage %) and, ultimately lead to a stronger value perception and sustained customer ordering behavior (AOR) .",Feb,High,Medium ,,"Evolve Loyalty to Reward A Long-Lasting Relationship & Engagement, Not Just Transactions",,,,PRD : [MVP] Loyalty 2.0 -WIP,,,,,,,
