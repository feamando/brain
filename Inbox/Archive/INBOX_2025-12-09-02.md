Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Nikita Gorshkov and Beatrice Dimarucut discussed "charge at checkout" refunds, noting that a week is too long for the process and that tracking refunded customers separately may be necessary, and they agreed to consult with Kag to clarify how refunds and cancellations are individually tracked in the AL system for paid orders. Nikita Gorshkov is introducing Beatrice Dimarucut to the Spur founders, whose competitive analysis tool addresses tracking and comparing flows to an ideal state, and they have financial approval to procure them as a supplier. Furthermore, Nikita Gorshkov is opening a CS5 role for Beatrice Dimarucut to mentor, providing career development and shoring up work with Yuri following Dio's departure, and assured Beatrice Dimarucut that potential resistance from Annie would be minimal due to the defined headcount structure and involvement of key people like John, Yuri, Seb, Alex, DA, and external folks from payments and customer care.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Discussion on Charge at Checkout Refunds Nikita Gorshkov and Beatrice Dimarucut discussed the issue with refunds for customers who use "charge at checkout." Nikita Gorshkov expressed concern that a week is too long for a refund process (00:01:00), and they explored the possibility of tracking customers who ask for refunds separately on their end (00:01:56). Beatrice Dimarucut confirmed that refunds work via AL (a system) for charged at checkout customers, but the problem arises when non-charged at checkout customers call to cancel their first box before the cut-off (00:03:25).

* Clarification of Refund and Cancellation Process in AL Nikita Gorshkov questioned whether a paid order via charge at checkout should ever be in the status "canceled" in AL. Beatrice Dimarucut thought it should be possible to cancel a paid box if it is not yet in shipping status, but they were unsure if the status would be "canceled and refunded" (00:07:54). They agreed that they need to ask Kag if refunds and cancellations are tracked individually (00:11:48), and they discussed the need for a mechanism to check for paid "charge at checkout" orders that are merely in the "canceled" status to ensure a refund is processed and avoid customer complaints (00:09:54).

* Spur Call and Competitive Analysis Tool Nikita Gorshkov explained that the "spur call" is to introduce Beatrice Dimarucut to the Spur founders, who have developed a new agent for competitive analysis. This new tool, developed after they proposed the use case to Spur, addresses how to track and compare different flows to an ideal state, which was a challenge Nikita Gorshkov faced with a previous personal project (00:13:56). The tool is an external service for internal workflows, and the team has received financial approval to procure them as a supplier (00:15:18).

* Career Development and Team Structure Beatrice Dimarucut mentioned that they haven't had a career development call recently, and Nikita Gorshkov recalled giving feedback on areas for them to work on, specifically how to shore up work with Yuri in a more long-term thinking perspective, especially with Dio leaving (00:16:33). Nikita Gorshkov confirmed that adding headcount is proceeding with alignment across multiple VPs. They plan to open a CS5 role that Beatrice Dimarucut will start mentoring, which will establish a "brilliant setup" (00:17:37).

* Discussing Potential Resistance from Annie Bea

going to be a uh uh CS5

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: live uh so that you also start mentoring more junior members of the team uh going forward.

 

 

00:18:52

 

Beatrice Dimarucut: Okay, sounds good.

Nikita Gorshkov: And then we have a brilliant setup.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Okay, nice. Um, do you think like I mean I don't have like any touch points with Annie or so like do you think she might be like difficult to Okay.

Nikita Gorshkov: It shouldn't be the case. Um, I mean it's worthwhile. Is it worthwhile?

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah. You tell me. I don't know as in like I mean I don't have any natural touch points with her so I just don't know if there's going to be any like resistance or so like if in the end I guess her

Nikita Gorshkov: Sorry, it say no.

Beatrice Dimarucut: approval is needed. I don't know.

Nikita Gorshkov: No. Uh look, at the end of the day, you're going to have uh John, myself, Yuri, Seb, uh Alex, uh DA, and we'll take a bunch of uh folks uh external that you've been interacting with. So, off of payments, uh um customer care here, we'll think about who else to bring onto the board uh uh onto this discussion.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah.

 

 

00:20:04

 

Beatrice Dimarucut: Okay. Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: It's really yeah should be fine.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah. That's okay. Mhm. All right. Sounds good. Cool. Then

Nikita Gorshkov: Like I'm not going to say no but I agree that there are no natural touch points. Moreover, you're working on the main objective uh document that's reporting into Dominic outside of like her structure. Your headcounts is also defined outside of her structure. Um, well, because it's New Ventures, it it's tough to find like an artificial, "Oh, Annie, let's go for a coffee."

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: Like, sure, but also I I don't think it's like if we figure out what if there's a big dependency, but for Q1, we don't have any big dependencies, honestly.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah. Yeah, I mean intentionally so as well I think. But um no, I mean I don't need to like force it. It's more just so like I don't know if if we think it's going to be a risk that it might be a blocker then Yeah. Okay. Okay. Cool.

Accessibility-2025 Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Accessibility-2025 Program,,,,,,,,,,Recent action Items,,,,,,

,Welcome! The Accessibility-2025 Program will enable HelloFresh Group to complete HelloTech Objective #4 and comply with the modern level of accessibility for our customers driven by The European Accessibility Act (EAA). The program has two goals:,,,,,,,,,,🔄,"Resolve 90% of the P1 issues identified through Cypress that break 11 WCAG rules and manual audits in WEB.
Deadline: December 31st.",,,,,

,1,"Reduce the number of ""important"" Accessibility issues in HelloFresh, GreenChef, and Factor by 90% in WEB experiences by 28 June 2025, and in Mobile experiences by 31 Dec 2025.",,,,,,,,,🔄,"Resolve 90% of the P0 issues identified through Cypress that break 4 WCAG rules and manual audits in REACT NATIVE.
Deadline: December 31st.",,,,,

,2,Establish accessibility standards to support future HelloTech product development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Current P90 compliance,,,,,,source

,Background,,,,,,,,,,WEB,,,,MOBILE,,

,"The European Accessibility Act (EAA), which mandates that websites and mobile applications comply with WCAG 2.2 Level AA accessibility standards, will come into effect on June 28, 2025. The directive applies to all businesses in the EU, including HelloFresh. Non-compliance can result in penalties such as fines (ranging from 500–500k€) or, in some countries like Ireland, even prison sentences. Companies may also face legal action from disability advocacy groups.",,,,,,,,,,33%,,,,8%,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Remediating the risk of fines requires a company-wide collaboration, which is the background of launching this program. Apart from avoiding fines, improved Accessibility in our interfaces also gives us access to new potential customers (with disposable income) who previously may not have considered our product because they functionally were prevented from doing so. There is no calculated business case for the Group yet, but we plan to dig deeper into the opportunity in H2. The program will be driven by Foundations Alliance and involve all CFAs teams owning Front End TRE in mobile or web.",,,,,,,,,,2025 compliance target,,,,,,source

,,,,,,,,,,,WEB,,,,MOBILE,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Foundations Alliance made all Zest components compliant with EAA standards out of the box, however, this does not guarantee full compliance. To achieve full compliance by June 2025, all CFAs will review their journeys and modify them as needed. 

Foundations Alliance has provided the following inputs to enable CFAs to minimize their efforts:",,,,,,,,,,53%,,,,20%,,

, ☑️,"Improved Zest Design System components for iOS, Android, Web, and React Native platforms to have complete compliance with accessibility guidelines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,Created and maintain solution-oriented Accessibility Guidelines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,"Align, Define and Report upon an Accessibility Compliance Score.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,Automated the identification of code-driven accessibility issues based on the automated end-to-end UI Tests,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

﻿📝 Project Setup

Influencer Marketplace: Strategy





Last Updated: Dec 8, 2025, by Annette MvdE





Project Status

Project Name

	‘Recipe Creator’ Marketplace

	Current Phase

	3. Prototype & Validate: MVP Blueprint

	Current Sprint

	Sprint 4, week 1

	Current Status

	On time

	CA first

	



Problem Statement

Social media has become a primary hub for culinary inspiration, where people turn to influencers to discover new recipes. While Followers struggle to find the necessary ingredients and an easy way to re-cook them, Influencers look for new revenue streams to be more independent from the heavily controlled platforms and find new ways to expand their reach and engage with their audiences authentically and organically via food.





Opportunity:

Hellofresh sees a huge opportunity to serve both: by transforming influencers' inspiration (recipe) into a shoppable, cookable meal kit for the consumers. 

By bridging the gap as the Expert in operation, warehouses and logistics, we provide customers a way to enjoy these recipes easily and the influencer to serve their followers and create a new revenue stream. The social commerce market is growing rapidly and can represent a huge opportunity for us to attract new customers.





Why now:

We see the urgency to act now, because influencers are already trying to solve this problem with links to ingredient orders  via Instacart or Pinterest partners with Instacart to enable 1-click grocery list generation from saved pins. But today, shoppable content on social media within the food category is often limited to individual food items as opposed to a holistic offering where the ingredients for entire recipes and direct delivery can be purchased. 





The Core Ask 

WBD: Influencer Marketplace

Explore desired and viable vision for a curated recipe creator marketplace (1. influencer, 2. Aggregators) with the option of an  instant purchase as a meal kit ‘fulfilled by HelloFresh’.





Long-term Vision (Later) 

Transform HelloFresh into the “Spotify for food”  a platform where any creator can share a recipe that HelloFresh fulfills.

Prototype Test

Prototype for evaluating the concept













[a]I think in the script we can keep the intro we are already using and maybe shorten the section about them and their content. I think it would be important to get some context still on their content and background but maybe we just trim that down from what we had before so it doesn't take up as much time.

[b]Do we want to continue to cover anything from the previous sessions? I think getting some more data on how they follow trends might be helpful and I do want to ask about their pricing expectations around the 'set your own price' idea. I know they said they don't need data on it, but I think it would still be helpful to gather some since we won't have many opportunities to speak with influencers.

[c]Are we showing more concepts than what we walked through with the team last week?

[d]would we need to create a hellofresh shop with all influencer recipes to shop and the influencer itself advertise it?

﻿Final YP





💡 Meeting Notes [To be filled after the Review Meeting by the YP Document Owner and sent out via email to attendees. This section does not impact the maximum number of pages]

Review Meeting Date: Oct 16, 2025

Attendees: Ed Boyes Assaf Ronen Dominik Richter Holger Hammel,Cho HwangAnnie MeininghausDina MehrezThomas GrieselFabien SimonMarlene RosnerBrian LeungAdriana VillarEvan WeintraubJama Musse





Key Takeaways, Decisions, and Next Steps:

1. Clarify how menu expansion plans, personalization roll outs  and app features come together: 

   * Elysium (new store and homepage in the app) roll out is fast followed by new app feature which benefits users  irrespective of menu ranking roll out (most notably merchandising widgets for marketing,  recommendation widgets,bringing search to apps, populating “most popular, “trending” widgets - details)

   * Menu ranking roll out: At the same time there is a roll out plan for menu ranking models which prioritizes P500 readiness in Q4/Q1 as well as Penguin for Factor US. Food Systems is trying to expedite Penguin for INTL if possible, prioritized after p500. Fall back is to launch Penguin Harp personalization to INTL markets expanding in Q1.  Other RTE markets in H2.

2. Share prioritization framework  for Project 5M. The prioritization is heavily influenced by successful companies and features observed (direct or indirect competitors) as well as through an internal workshop. This revealed a consistent and significant behavioral gap: Users enthusiastically save recipes (often from social media) but rarely act on them. This indicates a high desire for inspiration but a significant friction point in execution. This led to the prioritization of the recipe bridge in Q4/Q1. If requested we can  walk through the detailed methodology.

3. Decouple forecasting from personalization models. Food Systems to define technical interfaces enabling independent iteration. Once validated, assess org impact in Q1–Q2.

4. Reconcile marketing RAF plan with tech YP.  We have addressed the  gap between Marketing and Consumer growth targets. Share squad will focus on strengthening the Refer-a-Friend (RAF) program while building new in-product sharing loops to drive organic growth. prioritizing foundational fixes — improving data visibility, customer experience, and operational agility — to make the RAF program self-sufficient and easier to optimize without tech dependencies. 

5. Variable pricing is an urgently requested feature by markets. We added it  to the Market Innovation squad backlog H2. Will define long-term ownership before initiation as we are currently moving pricing ownership to growth MA. 





Changes requested to the Yearly Plan during Draft Reviews. Please update before submission for final YP approval:  

* Should we invest into an AOV-focused squad? Yes we will self fund a new AOV driven squad in Q2 with a dedicated KPI. Focus in Q1  is first to roll out the new personalized core journey including widgets and then layer in more upselling components. 

* Loyalty strategy across markets: We decided to reserve a small team to  maintain and improve the existing  program while implementing  the new vendor based loyalty program to launch first in  the US . See Loyalty Strategy SMT Shareout.

* Double check if all Factor requirements are in the plan: All documents were collected and integrated into the Market Innovation backlog. To be signed off by Ed Boyes

refunds, noting that a week is too long for the process and that tracking  

refunded customers separately may be necessary, and they agreed to consult  

with Kag to clarify how refunds and cancellations are individually tracked  

in the AL system for paid orders. Nikita Gorshkov is introducing Beatrice  

Dimarucut to the Spur founders, whose competitive analysis tool addresses  

tracking and comparing flows to an ideal state, and they have financial  

approval to procure them as a supplier. Furthermore, Nikita Gorshkov is  

opening a CS5 role for Beatrice Dimarucut to mentor, providing career  

development and shoring up work with Yuri following Dio's departure, and  

assured Beatrice Dimarucut that potential resistance from Annie would be  

minimal due to the defined headcount structure and involvement of key  

people like John, Yuri, Seb, Alex, DA, and external folks from payments and  

customer care.





Suggested next steps





Beatrice Dimarucut will summarize the owl issues for Nikita Gorshkov.



Nikita Gorshkov will formalize the career development plan for Beatrice  

Dimarucut.



Nikita Gorshkov will create the promo case for the new headcount and talk  

with Jamba about the candidate to open the CS5 role.



The group will ask Kag if refunds and cancelled are individually tracked.
