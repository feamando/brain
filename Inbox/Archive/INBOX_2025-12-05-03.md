Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Sameer Doda confirmed that the overall work volume is manageable, with Allison assisting on the platform and Good Chop Shopify projects, though Sameer Doda and Nikita Gorshkov noted that program revivals are unlikely due to a lack of resources, a point Sameer Doda, David, and Nikita Gorshkov discussed with Marina regarding unfunded work. Sameer Doda detailed their involvement in the complex Good Chop Shopify project, the DACH Juices support project for Nordic markets that requires a technical solution, and the Influencer Marketplace, which needs an MVP path forward due to varied stakeholder views and already has design progress with Shay; Sameer Doda and Nikita Gorshkov agreed on a simple one-time purchase customer journey for the MVP, but Sameer Doda raised concerns about limitations with applying vouchers and selling add-ons, which Nikita Gorshkov suggested discussing with Jama, and both acknowledged a need for more frontend development resources. Sameer Doda needs to coordinate with Jama for the roadmap review meeting and discussed the "Seamless Pricing Upgrade" initiative, which Nikita Gorshkov suggested de-prioritizing, while they also agreed to maintain two different views of the roadmap and implement an intake process with Ian as the tactical point of contact.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Overall Work Volume and Resource Allocation Sameer Doda confirmed that their overall volume of work is manageable, with Allison assisting on the platform and Good Chop Shopify projects. Sameer Doda and Nikita Gorshkov discussed that the revival of programs is unlikely soon due to a lack of available resources, unless it is fully funded, a decision that would need to come from Dominic (00:00:49) (00:04:03). Nikita Gorshkov noted that they, along with David, pushed back on Marina for introducing unfunded work that was taking up design capacity (00:03:05).

* Shopify Initiatives (Factor Form and Good Chop) Sameer Doda outlined their involvement in the Shopify projects, specifically Good Chop, which they anticipate will be more complex than Factor Form due to potential changes in the customer journey (00:00:49). The immediate next steps for the Good Chop project include developing a strategy document, creating a customer journey, and addressing edge cases such as account duplication and customer redirects, in addition to tactical work like third-party integrations (e.g., Recharge and Elevar) (00:02:10). Sameer Doda is confident that they can now manage the setup of Recharge if Allison is unavailable (00:03:05).

* DACH Juices Support Project Sameer Doda explained that Jama brought up a project to support launching juices in the Nordic markets, which Sameer Doda discussed with stakeholders and promised to provide timelines for in January (00:04:54). The required technical work involves automatically adding fan charges as a separate line item to the cart and to the auto summary when a juice pack is added, a task that is more complicated than it appears. Sameer Doda plans to create a requirements document after receiving answers to questions they posed to Viola (00:06:15).

* Influencer Marketplace Strategy and Customer Journey Sameer Doda has gone through all the research documents for the influencer marketplace and believes the initiative needs a proposed path forward for the MVP due to the variety of stakeholder views. They have created two separate customer journeys: one for customers buying as a one-time purchase box (former or paused customers) and another for active customers who might purchase an additional recipe (00:07:28). Nikita Gorshkov agreed with the focus on simplicity for the MVP, noting the very positive response from unstructured interviews and the potential for a viral moment, suggesting starting with three occasion boxes sold through influencers’ channels to prove demand (00:08:50).

* Influencer Marketplace Design and Logistics Sameer Doda revealed that they are already making progress on the design, with Shay working on pages and profiles. The plan is to align on the basic one-time purchase customer journey, quickly show low-fidelity designs to senior stakeholders for feedback, and then have Shay continue with high-fidelity designs, reusing existing components from projects like the Christmas box flow (00:10:03). Sameer Doda and Nikita Gorshkov agreed that active customers should be able to buy even a small kit, like a dinner for two, as a one-time purchase, simplifying the front-end by avoiding the need to enforce minimum rules (00:12:03). Sameer Doda will set up a session the following week with Nikita Gorshkov and Shay to review the basic customer journey and low-fidelity designs (00:13:10).

* Influencer Marketplace Backend and Timeline Concerns Sameer Doda expressed concern that the ability to apply vouchers for one-time purchases is a limitation that may not be solved in time, an issue Nikita Gorshkov stated needs to be addressed with Jama. Other concerns include the current inability to sell add-ons on the one-time purchase flow (00:15:12). Sameer Doda noted a potential misalignment with the HelloFresh Canada physical product team, who may be planning for a Q2 launch, though Nikita Gorshkov indicated that Q2 is the latest agreed-upon deadline with Ian (00:17:54).

* Frontend Resource Needs Sameer Doda pointed out a need for more frontend development resources, as most of the current projects, including the influencer marketplace, the Benelix experiment, and the Duck juices support, involve significant frontend work (00:19:02). Nikita Gorshkov confirmed that they are looking to fill three open roles and that a frontend developer is needed to replace Deborah in addition to the existing team members (00:19:59).

* Upcoming Roadmap Review and Seamless Pricing Initiative Sameer Doda needs to coordinate with Jama on Monday to determine the invitees and process for the roadmap review meeting (00:22:19). They also discussed the "Seamless Pricing Upgrade" initiative, for which Sameer Doda lacks a clear problem statement beyond knowing there are general issues with seamless pricing (00:23:15). Nikita Gorshkov located the item in the initiatives log, which refers to encouraging upgrades and flexibility on smaller sizes, but noted that the comment dates it to Q3, allowing them to de-prioritize it for now (00:24:48).

* Roadmap Visualization and Intake Process Sameer Doda shared an alternative, more visual road map view that they prefer for presentation, which they agreed to continue maintaining alongside Nikita Gorshkov's preferred view that splits work streams into different "swim lanes" for better visibility of design, product, and engineering discovery allocation (00:26:07). Sameer Doda also introduced an intake sheet to manage new requests, though they need to define to whom it will be evangelized. Nikita Gorshkov proposed a structure where Ian serves as the tactical point of contact to minimize interactions with senior leaders like Ed, with road map reviews happening monthly for visibility (00:29:54).





Suggested next steps

* Sameer Doda will set up a session next week with the physical product team for HelloFresh Canada to align on the Q1 target date for the influencer marketplace.

* Sameer Doda will go through the answers received from Viola regarding the duck juices support and create a requirements document, including an estimate for when the work will be picked up in Q1.

* Sameer Doda will set up a session next week with Nikita Gorshkov and Shay to (1) review the basic customer journey for the onetime purchase flow and the low fidelity designs for the influencer marketplace, and (2) work with Shay to iron out changes needed on the low fidelity designs so Shay can continue working on the high fidelity designs.

* Sameer Doda and Nikita Gorshkov will connect with Jamba on Monday to discuss the roadmap review meeting with stakeholders and determine the invitees.

Sameer:Nikita 1:1 - Transcript

00:00:00

 

Sameer Doda: give us uh ids uh for which for each of those four branches and you know then we the only thing that's respons that we are responsible for is to take action on those email ids uh for all of those four branches so that simplifies things a little bit for us uh the the two things that I did mention to you those are the two things that we're trying to solve and Leman and Vander are working with those two respective teams we have a proposal for them we're just trying to see if it how it can

Nikita Gorshkov: Samir, I I guess I meant more about your general work because you have this and you have uh Shopify. Um and I know that Annette was bugging you around the the influencer marketplace, but the influencer marketplace I got one up. That's fine. Um uh I'm going to talk with Ian today as well in regards to like what's happening on his ends and get a feeling there.

Sameer Doda: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: Uh

Sameer Doda: Okay. So, my overall volume of work manageable.

 

 

00:00:49

 

Sameer Doda: Uh I'm I obviously have Allison's help on the platform Shopify stuff and then I will have I will continue working with her on the good chop Shopify stuff. I also spoke to Jamba because one of the things that I was concerned about was that there were these discussions happening on programs and uh Allison was under the assumption that as a result of these discussions with Dominic there is a possibility that uh uh programs might be revived sooner than she thought. I spoke to Jama was like nope it's not happening there are no people to do it and even so I I mean even with both with the factor form Shopify and with good chop Shopify both of these initiatives

Nikita Gorshkov: Unless unless it's funded 100%. Um, no.

Sameer Doda: I'll be involved uh with Allison um at the very last detail because I want to make sure that you know because both of them are they they are not so simple uh Shopify is sometimes complex and good chop actually will be even more complex than than factor form was because with factor form some of the thinking was already done in terms of what we needed to do there wasn't any change in terms of the customer journey but with good job there might be it it could be there could be a change in the customer journey so So I don't I mean

 

 

00:02:10

 

Nikita Gorshkov: Sorry, one sec. But I looked through the the statement of work. It was relatively minor. Um like it was very straightforward. At least the MVP side of it. So basically, it's only a one-off uh e-commerce experience, right?

Sameer Doda: it's the same scope though. It's the same scope though but we have to we have to tell them what to build right. So there are a few things that we have to uh get done. So the first one being we have to get that strategy document out.

Nikita Gorshkov: Mhm.

Sameer Doda: Second, we have to create a customer journey to tell them what is it that we need. Uh we have to look at we are looking at the customer journeys from different competitors on how they are handling this.

Nikita Gorshkov: H. Sure.

Sameer Doda: Uh and the third one is that there are some of these edge cases that we have to discuss the day we discussed it for factor form in terms of account duplication. How do we redirect customers from one platform to another?

 

 

00:03:05

 

Sameer Doda: some of those things and then there will be the tactical stuff which is stuff that we're doing right now for factor form which is you know integration of recharge integration of elevar all of these third parties so it's

Nikita Gorshkov: Recharge it through. Yeah. Yeah.

Sameer Doda: at that point it becomes more project management and and coordination rather than product management so uh and Allison is um familiar with all of these tools now and I'm hoping that we actually end up reusing a bunch of these tools so and so am I even if even if let's say Allison has to jump.

Nikita Gorshkov: I mean, no.

Sameer Doda: I can also now set up pre-charge.

Nikita Gorshkov: No. I like I like we'll see if Alison needs to jump. I I'm I don't think like that that's going to happen in Q1.

Sameer Doda: Yeah. Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: Uh realistically speaking, the only problem with the programs was that there was a Marina was stirring the pot for some unknown reason uh in terms of like pushing more and more work to be done while none of this being funded and she was taking up quite a bit of capacity on the design side.

 

 

00:04:03

 

Nikita Gorshkov: I together with David, we've pushed back very hard on this. um we don't understand what's the intent here and if Dominic needs to make a decision in terms of does he want to fund programs like earlier like none of this is going to be built uh or decided based on some high fidelity design like it should be based on commercial Yeah, exactly.

Sameer Doda: that and I mean honestly even if Dominic says that okay I'm going to fund this 100%. It will still take time to hire folks right there are because the existing folks are already tagged to some of the other teams and other pieces of work. So if we yeah unless Dominic takes the harsh decision to move existing resources immediately from some of the other initiatives which I don't think he exactly

Nikita Gorshkov: But this is the like, okay, this is what we don't do at HelloFresh at all, right? So, we prioritize and then we say, "Oh, well, but but maybe can we squeeze all of the other stuff that we couldn't prioritize?"

Sameer Doda: yeah I know I know so I I but honestly I don't think there's a risk in that so I have a so so both Shopify projects uh handled with Allison that's fine all of these small little things that

 

 

00:04:54

 

Nikita Gorshkov: Um, so

Sameer Doda: I was doing the Benelix thing uh the duck juices support that Jamba brought up to me I spoke I actually met the stakeholders and I actually told them that we'll be able to give them timelines in Jan not right now uh the support for launching juices and duck and the the Nordic markets.

Nikita Gorshkov: Wait, which project

Sameer Doda: Okay, let me give you this one picture that Jama gave me and he said that apparently this was discussed somewhere but uh either you or him forgot to to bring it up and add it to the road map but it has been brought up again uh for discussion and we need to work on this because Ed believes that yes we need to support this.

Nikita Gorshkov: Uh. Uh-huh.

Sameer Doda: Let me know if you don't have access. You should have access.

Nikita Gorshkov: Uh, what? Du is lunch.

Sameer Doda: So I'll give you a TLD summary.

Nikita Gorshkov: Um.

Sameer Doda: So if you go down to the screenshot uh a little bit lower, we basically need to do two things.

 

 

00:06:15

 

Nikita Gorshkov: Uhhuh. Uh. Uhuh.

Sameer Doda: One is that based on the item that is added, we need to add another item to the cart which adds this fan charges. So 70.75 users. So if you add a citrus boost pack, it which has three juices, we have to automatically add a line item for three fan charges and then we also have to add a line item to the auto summary to charge the same amount to customers. It's not as simple as it looks. By the way, I've already gone through the details of Yeah, but I had a but I had a chat with them.

Nikita Gorshkov: I know. Oh my f****** god. This is the on the Oh god. Okay.

Sameer Doda: uh there are a few questions that I've given actually I see there are a few answers so I have to uh go through these but once I have the answers to some of the questions that I had given uh to viola I will then create a requirements document for it but the thing is that we have to give an estimate for this in in Q1 in Jan on when we'll be able to actually pick this work up so so it's a it's a separate thing uh so Then the influencer marketplace for the influencer marketplace I actually wanted to set up some time next week to discuss with you because there are all of these research

 

 

00:07:28

 

Nikita Gorshkov: Mhm.

Sameer Doda: documents and I've gone through all of them literally uh now and I've been in those discussions with uh where Ian is also present for uh the recipe marketplace research where Anetta and Katherine present their research and I get

Nikita Gorshkov: Huh? Huh?

Sameer Doda: to hear some of his views. I think that I I kind of think two things about this initiative. One is that it is such an open-ended initiative that there are a lot of people with a lot of different views and they will always keep on having all of these views, right? So, we have to propose a path forward that this is what we're going to do for MVP and then move forward with that. That's the first thing.

Nikita Gorshkov: H.

Sameer Doda: The second thing is that um I have created two different journeys. One for customers who are going to buy it as a one-time purchase box. customers who probably are either former customers or maybe pause whatever there could be a million reasons why they would not million but at least three or four reasons why they would buy a onetime purchase but any active customer who's actually buying a box in that week already from HelloFresh should also get an opportunity to explore these recipes by these influences so I have a separate journey that I've created for them as well but I wanted to

 

 

00:08:50

 

Sameer Doda: sync with you and Jama before I share any of that with anybody.

Nikita Gorshkov: I think uh I think that's true that we will need that eventually but right now I think you're right.

Sameer Doda: Mhm.

Nikita Gorshkov: My general approach is that yes there's no let me take a step back because I was talking with uh Annette today Anetta today I went through all the uh documents in um the feedback and this is what I mentioned in the channel as well is that I actually think we're on to something here I have not seen for a very long time such a positive response in any unstructured interviews ever.

Sameer Doda: Yeah, agreed.

Nikita Gorshkov: Um, and this is to me seems like a that it has a potential for a viral moment here, which is really good. This is why I want us to be very simple very early on to just prove out that there is something uh to this. And that means we can seem to be okay in being able to get the supply from of recipes from our uh from potential influencers like they seem to be interested in this model etc. Now we need to prove

 

 

00:10:03

 

Sameer Doda: Mhm.

Nikita Gorshkov: out that there is a demand and sure we'll get some uh reviews and whatnot sorry some interviews and whatnot but I think the simplest thing is to take whatever positive uh positively looking uh influencers we have and create three occasion boxes and have them uh actually sell them as part of their you know on their channels.

Sameer Doda: Yeah. So, so that part of the journey is something where we're already actually making a lot of progress. So, I'm Please don't look at this right now.

Nikita Gorshkov: H nice.

Sameer Doda: The only reason I'm even showing the screen is to show you that uh we're actually doing a bunch over here to uh kind of create different pages, profiles, what the journey will look like, all of those things along with uh shape. So we have we have actually done a lot over here.

Nikita Gorshkov: Mhm.

Sameer Doda: But what I plan to do then is then I first plan to instead of showing these even low fidelity designs two two different steps. First is to just show the basic journey that for a onetime purchase box this is what the journey of the customer will look like.

 

 

00:11:13

 

Nikita Gorshkov: H.

Sameer Doda: Second once we are aligned on that journey very quickly we show the low fidelity designs uh to our stakeholders all of our senior stakeholders and even in the broadest setting where we kind of get the feedback from other folks. So we show the lowfidelity designs. In the meanwhile, Shay is already working on highfidelity designs as well, right? And and I've told Shay that you know keep on I mean go back look at the Christmas box that we've launched.

Nikita Gorshkov: That's right.

Sameer Doda: Look at that flow, right? And see what you can pick from there. That's one. And the other thing that helped us launch a Christmas box really quickly was to also reuse a lot of existing components. to see how you can piece together these designs that we have to create from the existing components that we already have in store and reuse them as far as possible to create that offering.

Nikita Gorshkov: Huh?

Sameer Doda: But I'll circle back to you and this is something that I'm thinking through but maybe you already have the answer and we can actually save some time there.

 

 

00:12:03

 

Nikita Gorshkov: Huh?

Sameer Doda: My only concern is that we do have a pretty large customer base in in in US right uh even in Canada right in both these countries.

Nikita Gorshkov: Mhm.

Sameer Doda: So in a as a Canadian customer, if someone actually goes to one of these influencer websites or social media content, whatever, and they see that content and they want to buy that meal kit, which brings them back to the Hellfish marketplace, onetime purchase flow, if they're already getting a box that week, right?

Nikita Gorshkov: H. No, but this is this is why we talked with Ian about this is that he's okay on losing money initially.

Sameer Doda: E, they will probably not buy an entire box, even the smallest size box, because we will have to put some kind of a minimum limit, right? We won't be able to ship just one meal.

Nikita Gorshkov: Um maybe it will be like a dinner for two uh kit but that like it's the a tiny box but we're okay of not having this as a movie like that.

Sameer Doda: Oh, okay.

Nikita Gorshkov: This is two days, two people like um it can be a for example if if that is the approach that uh like I think if we're okay on the commercial site and Ian was okay on the commercial side

 

 

00:13:10

 

Sameer Doda: Oh, so you able to buy just one key for two people? Oh.

Nikita Gorshkov: to do this then we should do it like buy yourself a special dinner.

Sameer Doda: Okay. Oh yeah. I mean, one, it makes things simpler for me because then I don't think about enforcing minimum rules on the front end. And second, it also solves this this random use case that I'm sharing with you that even if I'm getting a box as a HelloFresh customer, if I see one more recipe elsewhere, buying one more recipe in a given week is probably not that big of a challenge. So I can I will possibly go and buy that one more recipe. So that that's all. So then right now we'll just focus on the onetime purchase flow in that case and yeah it should be so then I um today's what today's Friday so within the next week I will have the uh I will

Nikita Gorshkov: Huh?

Sameer Doda: set up a session with you me and Shay to go through the very very basic customer journey in this case.

 

 

00:14:08

 

Nikita Gorshkov: Huh?

Sameer Doda: Second show you the low fidelity designs. I will work with Shay to iron out some of these things that she's added on the low fidelity designs that uh uh be wherever the changes are needed I'll work on them with her and then once these two

Nikita Gorshkov: Mhm.

Sameer Doda: are kind of done Shay can then go on to continue working onto high fidelity designs and then uh we can decide when to set up a session with Ian and with the rest of the stakeholders I think because launching for this we might also want to set up a session with Ed to show him what is it that we're doing, get his feedback as well, maybe even Marina, some of the senior leaders. And then we set up that session, we walk them through what we're doing and then we just kind of take it from there.

Nikita Gorshkov: Mhm.

Sameer Doda: The good thing about all of this is that the way I mean as far as I've been able to think about it, we will not be blocked uh by any backend limitations.

 

 

00:15:12

 

Sameer Doda: The only thing that I was hoping was there, but I don't think it'll be solved in time, would be the ability to apply vouchers for these one-time purchases.

Nikita Gorshkov: Well, we need to work with Jamba on this because it's it's getting to a point where we're constantly avoiding using vouchers anywhere because it's impossible to apply them.

Sameer Doda: That would have been Oh, wow.

Nikita Gorshkov: Like Crosselling doesn't have vouchers. OTV doesn't have vouchers across any brands that we're launching OTV and now this won't have vouchers or discounts.

Sameer Doda: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: It's like no no vouchers.

Sameer Doda: I didn't know crossing also didn't have vouchers. I thought crosselling would have vouches. Okay. Yeah, it's becoming it's becoming a constraint. And the second thing is that why we might not need it in the beginning, right? Because uh now there won't be any add-on recipes to start with probably for this use case. Uh but eventually the fact that we actually cannot sell add-ons on the onetime purchase flow right now is also something that's a bit concerning to me.

 

 

00:16:00

 

Sameer Doda: And it's also something where we we should probably solve it soon uh to to be able to then capitalize on it if there is market for it.

Nikita Gorshkov: Agreed. Agreed.

Sameer Doda: Yeah. So, thanks for that. Actually, you solved you solved a big part of the problem statement for me and actually reduced my work a little bit because I was I had to think about that other journey and she would have had to resign the other journey as well. So, yeah, but yesterday when I was speaking to Shay, she was asking me so can I work on high fidelity or not?

Nikita Gorshkov: No. Huh?

Sameer Doda: I told Shay that you know there is at least one screen that I know which will be there one way or the other which is the main storefront for these influencers on the marketplace and which will also probably take you the most amount of exploration and effort to create. So you might as well go and start doing that. In the meanwhile, we'll get clarity on, you know, how the rest of the pieces are uh lining up and then we can take a call.

 

 

00:16:55

 

Nikita Gorshkov: for sure. And and to be fair, like I think it's you're absolutely right that like the integration with HelloFresh will need to consider, but I think before we get there, there's so much potential in terms of actually growing the market for this particular product uh as a one-off that we still have some ways to go until we do like full-on integrations and stuff like that because that already becomes muddied and P500 and there's like I don't want to

Sameer Doda: Mhm.

Nikita Gorshkov: touch that world. We we still have Tik Tok shop to consider.

Sameer Doda: Mhm.

Nikita Gorshkov: Uh we and integrations there we need to figure out how like how to even make that. So hear me out. In my ideal world, once you see a recipe, whatever on Instagram, I want a single click it like, okay, sure, if we don't know anything about you, who you are, your address or anything like that, we would need some screens in terms of like are can we ship to you and things that in an ideal scenario like most of this information is possible to get from uh from Chrome or from Apple Pay or from Android uh

 

 

00:17:54

 

Sameer Doda: Right. Oh, yes.

Nikita Gorshkov: wallets. uh, PayPal. Um, and if this is an email that we already know, we should just log in and just there like just confirm that you buy it.

Sameer Doda: Yeah. Oh, 100%. So, express checkout was actually one of the things that I really wanted to do even for Christmas box. We didn't have time unfortunately, but yes, 100% yes for this. So, we will figure out all of these integrations to figure out how we can make it a one-click buy for customers as little friction as possible.

Nikita Gorshkov: Mhm.

Sameer Doda: Totally align on that. uh the one thing that I do want to call out then so if I look at the overall if I look at the initiives then for uh Q1 it is the influencer marketplace which I just want also uh

Nikita Gorshkov: H

Sameer Doda: wanted to call out that you put up a date for March and I'm going to set up a conversation next week with the physical product team for HelloFresh Canada. I think they're under the impression and under the plans that they actually have to set it up for Q2.

 

 

00:19:02

 

Sameer Doda: So if this is something that they need to do by Q1, meaning okay.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah. No, no, no. Look, it's fine. We can move it. Uh, and this is why I put the um confidence at low because I think it will be pushed to Q2 and that's okay. It's just that we did agree with Ian that we cannot push farther than Q2. That's the only thing.

Sameer Doda: Yeah. No, no, makes sense. I mean honestly speaking we if the if the if the physical product teams can actually get these products ready we will be able to service this by the end of Q1 hopefully but this is all front end now right most of this work is now front end the Benelix experiment that we have to conduct for the premium tier that the phase 2 is also front end right the dark juices support is a little bit backend but there is also some front end work to What I'm trying to say is that there is a there are a lot of these front end pieces uh that are getting added.

 

 

00:19:59

 

Nikita Gorshkov: H. Yeah, but to be fair, we don't need a

Sameer Doda: I'm not sure how many front end resources we have because even if Philip comes back, we have Amique and Philip and Sneha to support with the mobile app. But for instance, on this one, I don't think that we're going to launch an app version for it. So uh SNA will be able to support the Benlex premium subscription experiment but then we need more yeah yeah so we need more

Nikita Gorshkov: a an app version, especially if we are looking that this will be a mainly through third party channels uh acquisition. So, I I'm not worried about that. One sec.

Sameer Doda: web developers basically front end developers

Nikita Gorshkov: Uh okay. And uh where the hell is it? Uh, new ventures, engineering and products.

Sameer Doda: So all the back fields are back.

Nikita Gorshkov: So, we have live and we have approved and awaiting posting. So, we have three roles that are going to be open soon. And I let me double check placement.

 

 

00:21:12

 

Sameer Doda: So in place of DA, DA is a full stack developer. Are we getting a front end or a full stack?

Nikita Gorshkov: Deborah is a um is an engineering manager.

Sameer Doda: Oh yeah, he won't actually.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah.

Sameer Doda: I keep on. So this this structure is is a little new because I keep positioning where yeah so we'll get a we'll get a staff developer in place of DAO I don't think we need another engineering manager right we already have

Nikita Gorshkov: No, no, no. Look, uh Deborah will move out. Let me share this. Uh No, no, no. Uh, we have ender for that.

Sameer Doda: band for

Nikita Gorshkov: So, we have uh an FE. Why do we have a back? I think this is just um Let me just add this as a comment.

Sameer Doda: What the hell?

Nikita Gorshkov: So I think this will be an uh FE. Then we have SNHA and yeah instead of Davver we'll need to get an uh a front ender as well.

Sameer Doda: Okay.

 

 

00:22:19

 

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah, that would make sense I think.

Sameer Doda: Yeah, that will probably Yeah, that'll make a lot of difference.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah. Cool.

Sameer Doda: Sounds good. And then uh two more quick questions for you, but we have only one minute left.

Nikita Gorshkov: Okay.

Sameer Doda: Let's so first question is I want to set up that uh so Jama told me to set up that um road map review meeting uh with stakeholders and I'm I'm he obviously think he wants to discuss that next week when he comes back. I also want to kind of get a sense check from him on who the invitees should be for that road map review uh for the Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: Wait for for which road map? uh for the road map review for MIO specifically, right? Um yeah, actually to be fair like uh uh let's connect with Jamba on Monday.

Sameer Doda: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: I also don't know yet because Jama said he would hand it over but he never handed to do because also I uh left uh um so let's connect with him on Monday and then see.

 

 

00:23:15

 

Sameer Doda: Okay.

Nikita Gorshkov: I don't know what the exact process that they aligned uh with is uh going to look like

Sameer Doda: Okay. Sounds good. The second thing is that uh there is another initiative on that uh on the list of things that you shared which is seamless pricing based initiative whatever but I don't have a problem statement for it. I know what the problems are with seamless pricing uh but how many of those are we going to solve will decide the extent of that initiative.

Nikita Gorshkov: H can you remind me? Uh what was it? Um what was the problem there?

Sameer Doda: So that's what I don't have the problem statement. I just have a line item seamless pricing upgrade. That's it.

Nikita Gorshkov: Seamless pricing upgrades. Seamless pricing upgrades. One sec. Create. Why is simul pricing upgrade? Uh what is the problem with uh seamless pricing in the first place anyway?

Sameer Doda: So there are two problems with seamless pricing. The first problem with seamless pricing is that it uh it keeps on jumping.

 

 

00:24:48

 

Sameer Doda: So it's a basic pricing structure itself.

Nikita Gorshkov: Uh wait wait wait there we go there we go it's in the initiatives log um as we onboard more customers into factor on smaller sizes for example for blah blah blah we better and easier seamless experience to encourage upgrades and flexibility on a weekly basis to drive a better seamless merchandising promoting upgrades based on personalized recommendations seamless downgrade but we have seamless downgrades But let me double check.

Sameer Doda: We have seen this downgrade although it's a very hidden feature. A lot of people don't know how to use it properly on ready to meet.

Nikita Gorshkov: No, this is seamless improve AOV merchandising market.

Sameer Doda: It's a very very hidden HelloFresh. It's a different feature.

Nikita Gorshkov: Okay. MD squad Q3. Wait. Uh, now it says Q3. Why did I have it for Q? It's weird. Um, let me double check. Um. Ah. Okay. Wait. Okay. Let's take Jesus.

Sameer Doda: based on personalized recommendation.

 

 

00:26:07

 

Nikita Gorshkov: This this thing keeps increasing. Um maybe see.

Sameer Doda: Oh yeah, the actually the the comment says Q3 actually. So then I be less worried about it.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah. Uh okay. Let me double check on the wish list. Uh yeah, it says Q3. So just move it to from the road map.

Sameer Doda: I mean I still keep it on the road map. I'll just move it.

Nikita Gorshkov: No, but move it. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

Sameer Doda: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah. Let me

Sameer Doda: All right. Okay. Uh road map as well. So I did create an alternative view that that I've been uh using for the past three four years. I can keep both the views updated. This one just gives me a little bit more view of where I am right now and easier for me to present. But let me know if if uh if this works for you as well, then I can just maintain one

 

 

00:26:59

 

Nikita Gorshkov: one sec. Uh, oops. Status. It's okay. Sorry. Like this date. This bucket. Okay. Uh, sorry. Uh, what's the format?

Sameer Doda: If you if you see the next tab

Nikita Gorshkov: Ah. Uh-huh. But it's the same. I honestly like the only thing is uh why I separated it and why on new ventures we kind of have it that way. Um I used to have uh road maps similar to yours, but then everybody like Yara uh I think we evolved it uh into this one for uh two reasons. In this case, it's kind of hard necessarily to split out certain work streams, especially if you have like very small things on uh and number two, it became important at least for our stakeholders on the new venture side where to have uh the experiments and the experiment timelines themselves so that we don't lose visibility in terms of where we're allocating because if we're allocating for example on the funnel, we should see that we shouldn't be building another experiment in the funnel within that time frame while the allocation is happening so that we don't you know muddy the waters for example that's why we had it there design was to visualize like what is the scope uh of work on design um because there could be multiple things in parallel same on product and engineering discovery that also takes a lot of time and that's why we kind of split these swim lanes let's call

 

 

00:28:51

 

Sameer Doda: Okay, we did solve for those uh I can search for my old Okay,

Nikita Gorshkov: Like like otherwise I'm I'm fine like as long as the visibility is there like I I'm fine with this view either like I Look,

Sameer Doda: sounds good. Yeah, because we used to uh what we used to do was that we used to write it down in these cells themselves. Uh allocation start. So allocating allocating in these in these boxes themselves it kind of gives Oh yeah I I agree all of these versions they work perfectly.

Nikita Gorshkov: dude, I think over the 17 years I've seen every single version of how a road map can humanly look like. Oh, like uh I've updated the initiatives log with the new items that uh they had on this wish list.

Sameer Doda: It's just about I I think it boils down to personal preferences at the end of it and the ease of use for for at an individual level. That that's pretty much it.

Nikita Gorshkov: Uh yeah, I don't know how it's maintained or or updated, but at least now it's Yep, agree.

 

 

00:29:54

 

Sameer Doda: Okay, I also created this intake sheet. Uh if you see the third tab, we can probably start evangelizing this as well for anyone who wants to add a request, they can add to this.

Nikita Gorshkov: We just need to figure out how exactly we and to whom we do evangelize this.

Sameer Doda: I know, I know, I get it.

Nikita Gorshkov: My my targets are going to be I want to make that Ian the tactical point of contact essentially like I don't want to be talking with a thousand different people. Uh, and I don't uh or you talking with a thousand different people and I don't want us to be talking like three times a week because like uh with Ed because that's a recipe for failure. He has way too much s*** on his uh plate so he will never be available and then we're here shoveling dirt from oh US is saying one thing and Ben is saying another thing.

Sameer Doda: Oh, yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: So I do want like Ian maybe and maybe somebody on the US sides to actually like have a small group of like decision makers and if there's a tiebreaker that's needed on that level or above then yes we can go to it.

Sameer Doda: Yeah, 100%. But I mean even Jama said that the frequency for such a road map review would be like once a month something like that just to give visibility on where we are and all of these other decisions on what

Nikita Gorshkov: That's true.

Sameer Doda: gets prioritized on the road map can be handled se separately. Cool. Uh yeah.

	In Progress

	Background:

HelloFresh and Factor have invested in launching a range of Private Label shots and juices in Europe, with Factor also planning to launch protein shakes and electrolyte drinks soon. This portfolio of relevant, innovative and exciting products will strengthen our brand, drive net AOV and unlock incremental value in the Free for Life and Loyalty Programs. 

While the current juice and shot portfolios are available for HF and F-EU customers in NL and FR, they are yet not available in DACH and NOR due to the complex Pfand (deposit) requirements.

To launch any beverage in DACH and the Nordics (DK,SE, NO), we must meet 3 requirements:

1. Register with local regulatory agencies (completed)

2. Set up a local bottle deposit scheme (completed) 

3. Meet the minimum legal require

4. ments on our website and app, by clearly stating the relevant refund amount whenever a product is being ordered 

   * More specifically, the "Pfand" amount (e.g., "Pfand Amount x 0.25 EUR") must be declared expressly and separately in an additional line, not as "other charges." We also need to clearly display the individual costs for the customer, showing how much of the €0.25 is being charged (e.g., 1x, 2x, etc.). (more details below)

The first two requirements have been met. However the third requirement cannot be fulfilled with our current platform and requires tech support to drive the necessary UI and backend integration. Without this tech integration, the launch of all beverages > 100ml in DACH (as paid and FFL add-ons) is completely blocked, and puts the launch in the Nordics and IE in a grey area.

Solution needed: 

In summary, we must clearly display the deposit (Pfand) collected for all beverages purchased by the customer in the "Order Overview" step on the checkout funnel, and ideally in the invoice too. 

More specifically, the key change required is to add a new line within the 'order overview' section, located  on the right side of the screen,  clearly displaying the pfand amount and number of pfand's charged. For instance, if a product comprises a bundle of 3 bottles, it must state “3 x pfand”alongside the corresponding monetary value  (see picture below)





  











Questions to be clarified: 

* Does the €0.25 charge for a single-use bottle change market-to-market? 

Yes, the exact deposit amount changes market by market. 

Different sizes of the bottle could have a different price as well (recipe-dependent). 

* What is the exact name/translation for the "Pfand" charge for each of the three markets?        

The “Pfand” is the German translation of ”Deposit”. The name will need to be translated in all markets.

* Is it a definitive legal requirement to show the "Pfand" charge as a separate line item in the add-on section, or can it be omitted there?        

It is a must-have requirement to display a separate line item in both the Add-on and Order-summary due to legal requirements. 

   * If a customer orders multiple different juice/shot packs, can we show just one single collated line item for the total "Deposit" charge?

Confirmed. Example: h





Basket

	1x Recipe A: 3x ginger shots



	1x Recipe A: base price €5.99



3x Pfand: (corresponding to the n. of units in the recipe) €0.75

Total pfand: 

3x units (0.25) = €0.75

1x Recipe B: 5x Shot variety pack (3x ginger, 2x turmeric)



	1x Recipe A: base price €5.99

1x Recipe B: base price €8.99



8x Pfand: €2.00[a]

	2x Hellofresh Market product €14.98





Total pfand: 

8x units (0.25) = €2.00

	2x Recipe A: 3x ginger shots





	2x Recipe A: base price €11.98



6x Pfand: €1.50

	2x Hellofresh Market product €11.98





Total pfand: €1.50

	





[a]@sameer.doda@hellofresh.ca

Good news on the single line item in the add-ons section. 

We cannot omit it, but it can be aggregated as long as we show the exact units of pfand as in the order summary. 





Please let me know if I've answered all your questions and thanks again for the support!

Domain Objectives

Our marketing strategy for 2026 fully aligns with The Refresh ambition: to reignite brand relevance for HelloFresh and Factor, build sustainable, profitable (re-)acquisition and retention growth levers, invest in lasting customer relationships and unlock efficiency. Our primary areas of focus proposed for 2026 are described below by priority. 

TL;DR Priorities

What is in the more extensive write-up below is correct and captures the more detailed sketches of our plans for 2026. But within that, there are 4 key priorities that we will deliver with higher urgency than any of the other parts. These are as follows:

Frequently Asked Questions : 





   1. Where are the opportunities for GenAI applications in your domain?

Automated Business Insights & Decision Velocity: Expanding GenAI-driven reporting pilots across all channels and geographies to reduce manual monitoring and accelerate decision-making. This includes automating campaign diagnostics, creating narrative-ready insights, empowering teams with AI-driven alarming thresholds, and integrating conversational analytics tools for self-service analysis. Cross-market benchmarking to flag under/overperformance and recommend reallocations. Forecasting copilots for scenario planning (e.g., “What if we cut Google spend in DE by 10%?”). Social listening + web scraping to surface real-time cultural trends, competitive moves, and creative inspiration.

Personalized Customer Journeys at Scale: Scaling AI/ML to deliver one-to-one personalization across acquisition, retention, and reactivation. This covers dynamic content generation, tone and imagery adjustments, predictive send-time/channel optimization, and preference-based menu recommendations (e.g., best sellers, “new this week,” friend-ordered items). Predictive churn signals that flag at-risk customers earlier and trigger targeted journeys. Journey stitching across CRM + Paid to avoid siloed follow-ups.

Hyperlocal personalization (e.g., recipes, offers, or local partner content by market). Conversational commerce (chatbots in app/WhatsApp) that upsell, cross-sell, or resolve objections in real-time.

Experimentation & Testing Efficiency: Using GenAI to design experiments, automate QA, flag contamination, and accelerate rollout of learnings across channels (e.g., nested tests, synthetic controls, and always-on incrementality testing).

Workflow Automation – Automating repetitive tasks across Growth, CRM, and Paid (e.g., campaign QA, translations, reporting, landing page updates, and capacity planning), freeing talent to focus on strategic initiatives.

Creative Development Acceleration: Streamlining ideation, storyboarding, and asset variation through GenAI while ensuring speed, authenticity, and brand consistency. Applications include subject line/content variants, localizations, and high-volume content for influencers, partnerships, and SEO. Social listening, web scraping for rapid creative development ideation, reduction in briefing timelines. Using Influencer briefs auto-generated from past campaign performance. Build High-volume creative variation for TikTok, Meta, partnerships, and SEO. Co-branded partner assets drafted instantly, reducing bottlenecks in B2B/Retail Media campaigns.





   2. What are you doing to improve the customer experience? 

Rebalancing Growth Drivers: Transitioning from discount-led acquisition/reactivation to product innovation and quality-led storytelling. This means embedding food quality, menu expansion, and differentiated product experiences (e.g., new SKUs, cross-brand bundles) directly into CRM, referrals, and paid channels, giving customers stronger reasons to choose our brands.

Elevating Creative & Advertising: Driving relevance and engagement by embedding continuous creative testing, insight loops, and format innovation into how we advertise. Examples include partnership ads (Meta/TikTok), gamified referral mechanics, and integrated product-led narratives across influencers and affiliates.

Personalized Journeys Across Channels: Building seamless, cross-channel experiences that combine app, CRM, and paid touchpoints into one tailored journey. This includes integrating referrals into loyalty, embedding reactivation offers into app/product flows, and using AI to dynamically steer messaging mix.





   3. What are the known risks or obstacles to achieving these objectives?

Measurement of Brand Investments: MMMs and geo-tests do not capture long-term brand equity effects. We are building new frameworks to link brand KPIs (awareness, consideration) to financial metrics (CVA, CLV), but interim decisions will require conviction-based brand investments.

Data Quality & Fragmentation: Privacy regulation, lack of a unified source of truth, and fragmented data-sharing reduce the accuracy of DDA, mROI, and AI models. Dependencies on third-party platforms/vendors (e.g., Haus, Iterable, CDPs) create scalability and compliance risks.

Operational & Tech Dependencies: Marketing execution remains constrained by inconsistent campaign setup (e.g., CRM tooling, discount recommender rollout, Iterable migration), limiting speed to market and scalability of AI-driven personalization.

Competitive Landscape: Rivals with aggressive performance spend and diversified models (e.g., Hungryroot, Blue Apron) threaten share. Our hedge is focusing on customer centricity, innovating where product and offer differentiation directly meet unmet customer needs.

Digital Content Evolution: Rising consumer expectations and app fatigue increase pressure to deliver daily value beyond transactions. Scaling GenAI content generation and optimizing in-app experiences are critical hedges.

Reliance on Pay-for-Play Channels: Continued dependence on Meta/Google poses risk as LLM-driven search/visibility shifts accelerate. Mitigation requires diversification via SEO optimization, partnership ads, affiliate content, and testing new platforms (Pinterest, TikTok, WhatsApp, etc.).





   4. What objectives would MDs and other key stakeholders be most disappointed to have left out for 2026? 

Advanced Forecasting: While forward-looking forecasting of demand, CAC, and retention would improve resource allocation and give earlier visibility into marketing ROI, building these capabilities requires significant modeling and alignment effort across Finance, Data, and Marketing. Given our current focus on settled conversion measurement and efficiency automation, advanced forecasting will remain deprioritized in 2026, with only incremental improvements to existing planning and monitoring tools.

Portfolio-Level Optimization: Most of our steering still occurs at brand/channel level. A portfolio-aware approach to MMM and budget allocation (to capture cannibalization and halo effects across brands) could materially increase total HFG value, but may slip due to complexity.

Product Monetization Expansion: Alternative monetization models such as one-time ordering, non-subscription pathways, or flexible cadences have potential to attract new segments and reduce barriers to trial. We will test one-time ordering in a limited capacity in Q4 2025. Properly scaling and supporting these models requires product, operations, and go-to-market coordination beyond our current scope. In 2026, focus will remain on strengthening the subscription-led model, making it more engaging and re-engaging through improved brand experiences and app journeys.

Reactivations & Smaller Brands: The bulk of innovation focuses on large markets and leading brands. Smaller markets and brands risk being deprioritized for personalization, loyalty, and discount optimization, leaving value on the table.

Objective Owner:  Marcus von Franck

Investment Type: Existing    |   HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  5. Efficiency Program/Cost to Serve 





Description: While we’ve made progress, the bulk of our marketing investments including discounts and media spend, remain manually managed. This leads to slow feedback loops, exposure to errors, and overspending on activations that never become lasting customers. By embedding AI-led optimization and channel management and shifting focus toward higher-quality, retained customers, we will drive a step-change in marketing efficiency. Our goal is to deliver 25% more settled conversions (total, not proportional) at similar spend levels. This will free up resources to reinvest in brand building and create a more sustainable growth engine. We’ll achieve this by doing the following differently:

1. Transform the Growth Engine: Creative, Funnel & Performance Optimization 

   * Stepchange creative execution by building rapid customer-centric feedback loops with creative teams and using Gen AI to quickly produce content that resonates with customers, proving our products’ value in their lives while moving beyond purely transactional messaging

   * Automate performance marketing by shifting spend decisions (how much, when, where) to AI-led systems, with >80% of Google and paid social spend globally steered towards incremental settled conversions

   * Improve the conversion funnel by tailoring end-to-end experiences to different audiences, boosting CVRs and enabling higher CAC targets with more qualified traffic

   * Embed settled conversions as the core optimization metric for CVA growth, with playbooks to prioritize high-quality customers over discount seekers (60%+ churn by box 3 today).

   * Expand organic growth via SEO and GEO to rank top for food inspiration (including in LLMs), driving organic traffic and lowering reliance on paid ads in blended CAC

   * Measure and optimize for the incremental value of each campaign, using experimentation to validate results and refine measurement models. Measurement will also evolve to invest based on marginal value of advertising, focusing on the incremental return of each additional dollar spent

   * Double down on cultural halo performance channels (Influencers, Whitelisting, TikTok, Meta) that efficiently engage new audiences and place us at the center of culture. Be first to test new up and coming channels

2. Shape a Smarter Discount & Offer Strategy

   * Personalize discounting by deploying targeted offers (50% of spend) that move away from one-size-fits-all, campaign-level approaches

   * Diversify third-party offers (e.g., Caraway) to deliver customer value while reducing discount reliance.

   * Develop rapid, low-cost testing methods (on-site, synthetic audiences) to trial offers, discount structures, and messaging without disrupting paid media efficiency





Focus Area (tied to objective 2) : [Consumer-Focused] Reignite cultural relevance of our brands, with a bold shift in brand marketing approach

Measure of success: Brand Buzz, TOMA/Awareness (TOMA for HF, Awareness for F_ and startup markets)

Objective Owner:  Patrick Stal

Investment Type: Existing    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  3. Brand Reignition 





Description: HFG’s marketing has leaned too heavily on lower funnel channels and discount mechanics, eroding brand equity and long-term value. Despite spending €2.5bn on media and discounts over the past year, our brands lack relevance, distinction and a differentiated brand image. Brand investments have been sporadic, shallow, and cut too quickly in pursuit of short-term results, limiting innovation in awareness-building channels. In 2026, we will reignite appetite for our brands by showing up in disruptive and unexpected ways and leveraging the equity of culinary expertise, hype-worthy food content and highly engaged foodie fan communities. We will stretch beyond ‘pay for play’ to build conversation, earn our role in media and culture and deepen community engagement. Finally, we will allocate the investment and measurement resources to create space for innovation and feedback loops on what sticks. We will do the following differently:

1. Move from transactional communication to emotionally resonant, insight driven storytelling and messaging 

   * Sharpen articulation of (global) value propositions, messaging houses and (global & regional) superiority claims

   * Drumbeat product marketing comms that meet key customer needs through customer experience upgrades, product novelty, and FOMO via exclusive chef partnerships (e.g., restaurant recipe collaborations)

   * Establish cross-channel media planning as a standard practice to tailor messages across the customer journey — from emotional benefits to highly persuasive conversion drivers

   * Anchor our global brands in clear creative platforms to enable bold execution and distinctive, ownable  yet diversified content and activations locally

   * Shift from discount reliance to persuasive superiority claims and value-add incentives (e.g. Ltd Edition Le Creuset cookware, subscriber-only events, health claims, community exclusive experiences)

2. Commit at least 20% of paid marketing investment in total Brand demand generation 

   * Invest strategically across Portfolio with deeper commitments in some markets - guided by brand maturity and competitive context, and flexing above 20% where appropriate

   * Ring-fence half of this investment into disruptive, experimental and non-traditional channels to create brand demand generation activities (examples in point 3 below)

3.  Radically diversify our ‘Brand’ channel mix beyond traditional high reach channels and content formats

   * Integrate our brands into entertainment properties and high reach video channels (e.g. Masterchef sponsorship & feature, ‘I’m a Celebrity’, owned culinary formats, sport, athlete and nutritionist sponsorships for Factor)

   * Bring to life sensory-rich experiential activations via local food festival and cultural events calendar (e.g. HF chefs at Taste Festivals, Factor sampling at sporting events, retail popups, airport arrival retail, etc.)

   * Bring reach and appeal for our target audience via celebrity ambassador programmes featuring aspirational sports, chefs, lifestyle, or cultural figures (at least 2 A+ listers per brand (HF/F) in NA  and 2 in INTL)

   * Leverage 3rd party partners for surprising brand integrations that build earned media (i.e. AirBNB product boxes, Ikea kitchen partnership, special edition Crocs, Spotify culinary playlists, at least 4 cookware partnerships in NA (e.g. Zwilling, Misen, Caraway, Nutribullet, NINJA and 2 partnerships for Factor (e.g. Oura, lululemon, Hoku, etc))

   * At least 4 major multi-year sponsorships across global markets that strengthen our brands’ distinct propositions and build high physical visibility with our target communities (eg. venues, teams, events, competitions, festivals etc.)

   * Engage super fan communities for storytelling and advocacy by helping them identify, connect, celebrate, and advocate as part of the brand community - online and offline

4. Establish a clear Brand Measurement Model 

   * Quantify the most efficient way to build our brand with our audiences through a clear model that tracks efficiency of dollars spent on a single, comparable input metric (CPM, cost per impression).

   * Optimise the marketing mix by leveraging Ad Tech to deliver a brand MMM that measures channel contribution to brand metrics and commercial outcomes, covering 75% of brand investment by end of 2026.

   * Strengthen Brand Equity by dynamically deploying investments toward proven drivers of equity and growth.





Focus Area (tied to objective 2) : [Infrastructure] Build Muscle for Telling Brand Story and Change Consumer Value Perception

Measure of success: Grow XX% in total raw consideration, as a measure of the total# of brand considerers we have gained

Objective Owner: Patrick Stal

Investment Type: Existing    |   HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  3. Brand Reignition





Description: Despite Customer Centricity being one of HFG’s DNA values, we are not truly a customer-centric business today. We have cost-engineered products at the customer’s expense, built digital experiences around our own capabilities rather than their desires, and drifted away from the places where they naturally congregate, online and offline. To reignite the role our brands play in culture and improve how audiences perceive us, we must start with them. We must embed the customer into every decision we take. In marketing, this means embedding customer insights into every step of how we plan, create, and deliver experiences. In 2026, we will do the following differently:

1. Institutionalize Customer-Centric Planning

   * Embed customer insights into planning and execution, replacing inside-out thinking with an outside-in perspective. The planning cycle will start with a ‘customer brief’ to ensure all functions are building from a common set of insights. We will end it with a ‘knowledge agenda’ identifying the knowledge gaps and research roadmap to address those gaps.

   * Strengthen Customer Insights’ partnership with IXI research team as a global knowledge base (e.g. Slack ‘knowledge bot’ adoption expansion, synthetic audience democratization, ‘open to all’ focus groups across markets)

   * Dedicated time in every SMT summit to bring the ‘customer’ into the conversation (led by GCI & IXI Research)

   * Establish a rapid 24-hour insight cycle to ensure reputational priorities guide creative, messaging, and portfolio choices 

2. Define & Drive Perception Shifts Across the Experience

   * Anchor each brand in 1–2 clear messaging pillars (e.g., sustainable choice, fun discovery, trusted health companion) and ensure our external tone of voice reflects how customers actually talk about food - eliminating jargon in favor of cultural relevance (e.g., training AI copy and QA tools to flag and remove jargon)

   * Map the current brand experience and escalate fixes cross-functionally identifying low points versus desired standards, with SMT commitment to prioritize resolution

   * Reinforce brand experience beyond campaigns embedding it into product design, packaging, customer service, and the unboxing experience - making non-functional aspects of the brand come alive at every touchpoint

3. Build a Modern Content Engine

   * Automate transactional asset production (currently 80% of what we produce) and reallocate talent to create bold, platform-native stories that spark conversation and connection 

   * Transform recipe experience from instructions into cultural currency, reimagined through short-form video, creator partnerships, guided cook-along tooling, and interactive formats making them the emotional anchor of our brand. 

   * Build a global world-class paid social content-feedback-content engine by building on Xpod, fueling an ambition to deploy >20% of our paid spend into social

   * Build conviction in brand narratives and social-first creativity, training teams and automating rapid test-and-scale loops so our stories evolve at the speed of culture

4. Meet our brand target communities where they are

   * Actively listen to and take part in brand conversation ensuring we are listening and observing hyper local food trends, key categories of interest and cultural nuance per market to feel the pulse of conversation happening around our brands

   * Authentically contribute to our target audience’s online/offline communities and the passion points with which we want our brands to be associated (culinary and health) to meet them where they already are (TikTok, Instagram, Reddit, streaming platforms, audio apps, AI assistants, and dating platforms and IRL) and taking part in the conversations they care about

   * Master Paid Social to become the channel to test fast and scale the best performing content, native formats and messaging that most effectively engages our target customers  

   * Build nimble, experimental creative muscles tailored to the speed of social, while embedding cultural cues into the entire HelloFresh journey from sign-up to retention so food is experienced not just as utility, but as inspiration, creativity, and connection





Focus Area (tied to objective 4) : [Consumer-Focused] Build Lasting Customer Relationships Beyond the Box

Measure of success: Increase TCVA contribution of CRM channels by 20% (to be reviewed with BP) YoY while keeping opt-out rates stable or lower YoY

Objective Owner:  Jal TummalaJashil KimMarie Seeger

Investment Type: Existing    |   HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  4. App Experience





Description: In line with our goal of transforming the HelloFresh app into a daily food companion, our growth depends on building lasting relationships with our entire user base, from prospects to our most loyal customers. Historically, our user base marketing has been entirely transactional. We rely on discount-heavy pushes to convert leads and re-engage lapsed users, while limiting communication with active subscribers to managing their next box. In 2026, we will shift to a content-led strategy that reinforces the value we provide customers across their end-to-end food journey, not just when they order from one of our brands. This will transform our user experience into a new driver of our sustainable growth engine. 

   * Transform CRM communication channels into a source of daily value for customers, showcasing content and tools that help them with their daily food needs

   * Excite lapsed customers with content by giving them a reason to stay engaged through value-focussed, personalized content coming from both local and global sources

   * Improve the effectiveness of referral communications, powered by AI and ML, to encourage our most engaged customers to share content and refer friends - building on existing and finding new growth loops 

   * Expand the breadth of channels we use to communicate with leads, customers and formers adapting our experience to new messaging platforms (E.g. SMS, RCS, Whatsapp, etc.)





Focus Area : [Infrastructure] Modernize our marketing operating model and talent  





Measure of success: Over 75% of Marketing team members are at the medium level of the AI 

Objective Owner: Patrick Stal

Investment Type: Existing    |   HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  5. Efficiency Program/Cost to Serve

Description: Generative AI is redefining how campaigns are created, optimized, and scaled. This is an opportunity to build leaner, faster, and more provocative machines than the one we operate. Our ambition is that in 2026, HelloFresh should start to  operate as an advanced and provocative marketing organization: a GenAI-first machine powered by bold, world-class talent. Our teams will spend less time managing tasks and more time shaping culture, driving creativity, and building lasting brand relevance. We will achieve this by doing the following differently :

1. Automate the Marketing Backbone (also covered in DO 4) : 

   * Hardwire automation across campaign management, reporting, and diagnostics to collapse cycle times from wks to hrs. 

   * Automate intelligence to reallocate spend in real time across channels, audiences, and creative, while 

   * Personalize engines  that dynamically adapt offers and journeys at scale

   * Stronger foundational forecasting models and automate >50% of the current marketing budget process - freeing up hundreds of hours of capacity for more value-add tasks

2. Redesign the Marketing Operating Model

   * Shift from manual execution to automation-led orchestration, with a central control tower overseeing guardrails and agile pods combining media, data, and creative in continuous test-and-learn cycles

   * Daily and Weekly tracking meetings will be fed by AI and ML engines, and will be decision meetings rather than reporting mechanisms (recommendations being automated)

   * Playbook documentation will be standardized, archived in a crawlable manner for our AI enabled Marketing skill base

   * Best practices will be shared more pro-actively, and our tools will help us identify where learnings from one market could lift another in the portfolio

   * Shift human focus from repetitive tasks to brand building, provocative storytelling, and cultural engagement

3. Industrialize Creative Production (also covered in DOs 1 and 2)

   * Transform creative into a high-velocity system, where automation and AI accelerate asset generation, adaptation, and testing across formats.

   * Support storyboarding, copy design, and creative variation through GenAI, while strict guardrails ensure efficiency enhances, rather than dilutes, brand integrity and cultural resonance

4. Rewire Talent & Capabilities

   * Provide learning opportunity to receive basic AI training all marketing talent 

   * Map Talent on AI proficiency model per function, and AI proficiency will be a core aspect of JDs, competency maps, performance reviews and career progression

   * Reshape team to thrive in an automation-first world by adding new muscles : automation specialists, creative technologists and data engineers while ensuring existing talent becomes fluent in AI-enabled tools

Summary



Sameer Doda confirmed that the overall work volume is manageable, with  

Allison assisting on the platform and Good Chop Shopify projects, though  

Sameer Doda and Nikita Gorshkov noted that program revivals are unlikely  

due to a lack of resources, a point Sameer Doda, David, and Nikita Gorshkov  

discussed with Marina regarding unfunded work. Sameer Doda detailed their  

involvement in the complex Good Chop Shopify project, the DACH Juices  

support project for Nordic markets that requires a technical solution, and  

the Influencer Marketplace, which needs an MVP path forward due to varied  

stakeholder views and already has design progress with Shay; Sameer Doda  

and Nikita Gorshkov agreed on a simple one-time purchase customer journey  

for the MVP, but Sameer Doda raised concerns about limitations with  

applying vouchers and selling add-ons, which Nikita Gorshkov suggested  

discussing with Jama, and both acknowledged a need for more frontend  

development resources. Sameer Doda needs to coordinate with Jama for the  

roadmap review meeting and discussed the "Seamless Pricing Upgrade"  

initiative, which Nikita Gorshkov suggested de-prioritizing, while they  

also agreed to maintain two different views of the roadmap and implement an  

intake process with Ian as the tactical point of contact.





Suggested next steps





Sameer Doda will set up a session next week with the physical product team  

for HelloFresh Canada to align on the Q1 target date for the influencer  

marketplace.



Sameer Doda will go through the answers received from Viola regarding the  

duck juices support and create a requirements document, including an  

estimate for when the work will be picked up in Q1.



Sameer Doda will set up a session next week with Nikita Gorshkov and Shay  

to (1) review the basic customer journey for the onetime purchase flow and  

the low fidelity designs for the influencer marketplace, and (2) work with  

Shay to iron out changes needed on the low fidelity designs so Shay can  

continue working on the high fidelity designs.



Sameer Doda and Nikita Gorshkov will connect with Jamba on Monday to  

discuss the roadmap review meeting with stakeholders and determine the  

invitees.
