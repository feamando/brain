Summary

Nikita Gorshkov provided updates on PA support, noting Simon's increased visibility and contingent interviews with five independent contractors, while Maria Chelminska confirmed Tishia would be dedicated to TPT, Good Job, and VMS if hired. Maria Chelminska is working on business cases to provide evidence for OKR numbers, with Nikita Gorshkov emphasizing CVA impact over strict numerical accuracy, and Maria Chelminska expecting to understand overall goal achievement by the end of the current week. Maria Chelminska raised the long time to significance for experiments, with Farane suggesting the use of leading indicators or micro conversions to shorten this time, which Maria Chelminska noted would require more PA support and could face pushback, but Nikita Gorshkov agreed it makes sense for small experiments. Maria Chelminska stressed the need for an analyst to translate micro conversion impact to key metrics, but Nikita Gorshkov suggested focusing on overall business numbers like net revenue, AOU, and weekly active users, making assumptions about correlations between metrics.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Staffing and PA Support Updates Nikita Gorshkov provided an update on the PA front, noting that Simon, a senior, in-house FT PA, is becoming more visible after onboarding, with Eva having shielded them from direct interaction. They are also speaking with Tishia to finalize budget matters, and have five independent contractors lined up for interviews as a contingency. Maria Chelminska confirmed that Tishia, if hired, would be dedicated to TPT, Good Job, and VMS.

* OKR Tracking and CVA Impact Nikita Gorshkov emphasized focusing on achieving CVA impact rather than strict OKR numbers, stating that the numerical accuracy can be within a range of plus or minus 25% to 50%. Maria Chelminska is still working to look into things, run business cases, and provide evidence for the numbers, noting that the first CVR initiative was achieved months ago. Maria Chelminska expects to have a good understanding of whether the overall goal is achieved by the end of the current week by calculating the impact of the most valid launches.

* Experimentation and Shortening Time to Significance Maria Chelminska raised the issue of experimentation, noting that they discussed with Farane, Alex's manager, the current challenge of waiting six to eight weeks to reach significance for experiments. The interaction effects initially explored do not solve the problem of long allocation time to experiments. Farane suggested focusing on potential levers to shorten this time, primarily by using leading indicators or micro conversions as the main metric instead of, for example, CVR improvement, which would make the Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) easier to detect.

* Implementation of Micro Conversions and Potential Pushback Maria Chelminska noted that implementing micro conversions would require more PA support to set up the new metrics in static, which they have not done before. They also cautioned that micro conversions cannot always be used, citing price testing as an example where the impact affects the entire funnel, and they expect pushback on this approach. Nikita Gorshkov agreed that not all experiments are equal; critical experiments still need the actual conversion rate or revenue data, but for small experiments with high confidence and relatively small impact, focusing on the micro conversion at that step makes sense.

* Connecting Micro Conversions to Business Outcomes Maria Chelminska emphasized the need for an analyst to translate the impact of micro conversions into expected CVR or other key metric impacts, noting that a percentage increase in a micro conversion doesn't directly translate to the same increase in the overall conversion rate. Nikita Gorshkov suggested taking a step back and focusing on the overall business numbers, such as net revenue, AOU, and weekly active users, making the assumption that if, for example, they decrease cancellation rates, it should correlate with a higher AOU, as long as everyone aligns on this assumption. The OKRs are now focused on more trackable things like RPU or weekly active users, with net revenue as the ultimate north star.





Suggested next steps

* Maria Chelminska will look into things, run the business cases, and make evidence on the OKR numbers by calculating the launches in the doc that are the most valid and have the biggest expected impact, to understand if the OKR is done this week.

### DOC: GoC H1 2026 Product Prioritization - WIP
ID: 1aEr-u_dziuq-4JC1c1Jh0AkvszqzWCLFnmYVObfKQvg
Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aEr-u_dziuq-4JC1c1Jh0AkvszqzWCLFnmYVObfKQvg/edit?usp=drivesdk
----------------------------------------

﻿2026 Strategy

FTEs: 8 devs (3 parental fill, 2 backfills) → Q2 7 FE devs (+ 1EM +2 POs) + [new] 2 FE devs + 1 BE 

Q1: 7 FE devs (Himash, Becca, Romi, Pame, Nvard, Chi, Madeeha)

Q2: +2 FE devs, Bolo & Richa back (11 total FEs), 1 BE (TBD)

H2 2025 Reflection

In H2 2025, our product strategy was designed to address unrecovered Conversion Rates (CR) and declining Active Order Rates (AOR). For CR, we successfully launched the Reactivation page revamp and are on progress to launch the One Time Purchase experiment. On the AOR side, we drove Free Add-on take rates to over 90% consistently by closing gaps in the selection and persistence experience, and launched Charge at Checkout.

1. Reactivation Page Revamp. We launched a new, mobile-first reactivation page that reduces the page length by one third with improvements on information architecture and clearer call to action. Also, customers can now choose their free add-ons directly on the reactivation page, instead of after reactivating their accounts. These changes are foundational to run more free for life reactivation campaigns including turkeys on Thanksgiving  (+20% CR YoY). However, some critical features were de-prioritized such as the ability to change cadence and reschedule directly on the reactivation page. 

2. One-Time Purchases (OTP). The technical solution for OTP pivoted from the initial MVP hack to the proper solution due to a technical blocker from CRM as well as higher confidence in the new endpoint following HF rollouts. While this solution saves time in the long-term, the launch week is delayed (likely W2’2026 - TBC) due to additional time for another technical investigation and (unplanned) capacity constraints.

3. Closing Free Add-on Take Rate. By October we finally reached +90% free add-on take rate for both new and active users consistently. Persisting free add-ons (+40% active TR), developing the multi-add-on pop-up on funnel and reactivation (+5% TR), and migrating bundle offers to Wallet (4.2k customers). While it’s great that we finally closed down the Wallet take rate gap, a significant portion of Q3 engineering capacity was allocated, which was not originally accounted for in the H2 roadmap.

4. Charge at Checkout. By charging customers at checkout instead of at cut-off, we aim to improve empty conversions and acceptance rates, thereby positively impacting overall delivered orders.





Learnings: 

* Better resource planning for adhoc and technical initiatives needed: We only executed on 2 out of 5 key strategies referenced in the previous strategy document with projects such as the Pricing Value Experiment getting pushed to next year. When planning for H2 2025, we did not initially account for initiatives such as Subscribable free add ons, as well as more tactical initiatives like 2-week cadence or legal compliance initiatives in the (cancellation) funnel. Engineering capacity was also impacted around September-October due to personnel changes, including one transfer to TPT and two individuals taking parental leave. We also need to proactively account for resourcing technical initiatives such as endpoint deprecations and migrations.

* More space needed for iterations: there are initiatives such as Seamless and Search with clear next iterations, however instead of building these we focused on building new initiatives. This delays implementing these learnings and therefore realization of business value. Doing these next iterations with too much time in between can also lengthen development as the team has to re-learn the technical context for the next itera

... [TRUNCATED: 35010 chars omitted to save context] ...

due to the new page? do we have pre/post?

[q]i think this should be dependent on OTP leads results

[r]how come? I don't think the learnings from Leads test will necessarily transfer





It could work better because cancelled customers might have already experienced first-hand that subscription does not work 





We could even think about targeting specifically customers that have churned due to delivery frequency reasons

[s]-> hesitation more from a BC perspective + no ability to discount





-> refer to HF test learnings

[t]~10% cancel for "lifestyle" reason (="sub doens't work for me")

[v]that can be a significant lever for AOR and PC2 improvement, should we move fw knowing that part of it will be unlocked with the value test

[w]open to continuing price/value exp hack

[x]lay out limitations with hacks (eg roll out strategy)

[y]1 total reaction

Marina Guthmann reacted with ♥️ at 2025-12-03 15:40 PM

[z]potentially already planned for CDP v2 to fix data lag

[aa]it would be interesting to sequence the rebranding with value driven initiatives, such as richer PDPs. so we can collaborate with mktg on how to tackle the changes' communications

[ab]in the end if we want to do this well and continue highlighting new products, new deals, we eventually need to find a way to showcase surcharge cuts pre-checkout





I'm wondering if we should re-test surcharge pre-checkout but as its own section/maybe even bringing the 2-step flow pre-checkout 





because if we find a good way to frame surcharge cuts and Deals pre-checkout, then we will have more merchandising we can do pre-checkout as well





EOS+transparent pricing also a criteria

[ac]already big reasons to buy for prospects - we could target this to actives

Accessibility-2025 Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Accessibility-2025 Program,,,,,,,,,,Recent action Items,,,,,,

,Welcome! The Accessibility-2025 Program will enable HelloFresh Group to complete HelloTech Objective #4 and comply with the modern level of accessibility for our customers driven by The European Accessibility Act (EAA). The program has two goals:,,,,,,,,,,🔄,"Resolve 90% of the P1 issues identified through Cypress that break 11 WCAG rules and manual audits in WEB.
Deadline: December 31st.",,,,,

,1,"Reduce the number of ""important"" Accessibility issues in HelloFresh, GreenChef, and Factor by 90% in WEB experiences by 28 June 2025, and in Mobile experiences by 31 Dec 2025.",,,,,,,,,🔄,"Resolve 90% of the P0 issues identified through Cypress that break 4 WCAG rules and manual audits in REACT NATIVE.
Deadline: December 31st.",,,,,

,2,Establish accessibility standards to support future HelloTech product development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Current P90 compliance,,,,,,source

,Background,,,,,,,,,,WEB,,,,MOBILE,,

,"The European Accessibility Act (EAA), which mandates that websites and mobile applications comply with WCAG 2.2 Level AA accessibility standards, will come into effect on June 28, 2025. The directive applies to all businesses in the EU, including HelloFresh. Non-compliance can result in penalties such as fines (ranging from 500–500k€) or, in some countries like Ireland, even prison sentences. Companies may also face legal action from disability advocacy groups.",,,,,,,,,,33%,,,,15%,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Remediating the risk of fines requires a company-wide collaboration, which is the background of launching this program. Apart from avoiding fines, improved Accessibility in our interfaces also gives us access to new potential customers (with disposable income) who previously may not have considered our product because they functionally were prevented from doing so. There is no calculated business case for the Group yet, but we plan to dig deeper into the opportunity in H2. The program will be driven by Foundations Alliance and involve all CFAs teams owning Front End TRE in mobile or web.",,,,,,,,,,2025 compliance target,,,,,,source

,,,,,,,,,,,WEB,,,,MOBILE,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Foundations Alliance made all Zest components compliant with EAA standards out of the box, however, this does not guarantee full compliance. To achieve full compliance by June 2025, all CFAs will review their journeys and modify them as needed. 

Foundations Alliance has provided the following inputs to enable CFAs to minimize their efforts:",,,,,,,,,,53%,,,,20%,,

, ☑️,"Improved Zest Design System components for iOS, Android, Web, and React Native platforms to have complete compliance with accessibility guidelines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,Created and maintain solution-oriented Accessibility Guidelines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,"Align, Define and Report upon an Accessibility Compliance Score.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,Automated the identification of code-driven accessibility issues based on the automated end-to-end UI Tests,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,"Provided results of a 3rd-party Accessibility Audit for HelloFresh, GreenChef, and Factor brands across web and mobile platforms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

, ☑️,"Created and maintain a company-wide backlog of Accessibility issues to enable compliance tracking on an ongoing, daily basis",,,,,,,,,Upcoming milestones,,,,,,

﻿Final YP





💡 Meeting Notes [To be filled after the Review Meeting by the YP Document Owner and sent out via email to attendees. This section does not impact the maximum number of pages]

Review Meeting Date: Oct 16, 2025

Attendees: Ed Boyes Assaf Ronen Dominik Richter Holger Hammel,Cho HwangAnnie MeininghausDina MehrezThomas GrieselFabien SimonMarlene RosnerBrian LeungAdriana VillarEvan WeintraubJama Musse





Key Takeaways, Decisions, and Next Steps:

1. Clarify how menu expansion plans, personalization roll outs  and app features come together: 

   * Elysium (new store and homepage in the app) roll out is fast followed by new app feature which benefits users  irrespective of menu ranking roll out (most notably merchandising widgets for marketing,  recommendation widgets,bringing search to apps, populating “most popular, “trending” widgets - details)

   * Menu ranking roll out: At the same time there is a roll out plan for menu ranking models which prioritizes P500 readiness in Q4/Q1 as well as Penguin for Factor US. Food Systems is trying to expedite Penguin for INTL if possible, prioritized after p500. Fall back is to launch Penguin Harp personalization to INTL markets expanding in Q1.  Other RTE markets in H2.

2. Share prioritization framework  for Project 5M. The prioritization is heavily influenced by successful companies and features observed (direct or indirect competitors) as well as through an internal workshop. This revealed a consistent and significant behavioral gap: Users enthusiastically save recipes (often from social media) but rarely act on them. This indicates a high desire for inspiration but a significant friction point in execution. This led to the prioritization of the recipe bridge in Q4/Q1. If requested we can  walk through the detailed methodology.

3. Decouple forecasting from personalization models. Food Systems to define technical interfaces enabling independent iteration. Once validated, assess org impact in Q1–Q2.

4. Reconcile marketing RAF plan with tech YP.  We have addressed the  gap between Marketing and Consumer growth targets. Share squad will focus on strengthening the Refer-a-Friend (RAF) program while building new in-product sharing loops to drive organic growth. prioritizing foundational fixes — improving data visibility, customer experience, and operational agility — to make the RAF program self-sufficient and easier to optimize without tech dependencies. 

5. Variable pricing is an urgently requested feature by markets. We added it  to the Market Innovation squad backlog H2. Will define long-term ownership before initiation as we are currently moving pricing ownership to growth MA. 





Changes requested to the Yearly Plan during Draft Reviews. Please update before submission for final YP approval:  

* Should we invest into an AOV-focused squad? Yes we will self fund a new AOV driven squad in Q2 with a dedicated KPI. Focus in Q1  is first to roll out the new personalized core journey including widgets and then layer in more upselling components. 

* Loyalty strategy across markets: We decided to reserve a small team to  maintain and improve the existing  program while implementing  the new vendor based loyalty program to launch first in  the US . See Loyalty Strategy SMT Shareout.

* Double check if all Factor requirements are in the plan: All documents were collected and integrated into the Market Innovation backlog. To be signed off by Ed Boyes

Hi everyone,



As I prepare to close this chapter after 5.5 years, I find myself

reflecting on something simple but often overlooked: a team is not just a

group of people working toward shared goals. A team is a temporary

constellation: individual stars whose paths align for a brief moment in

time, long enough to create something brighter than any of us could alone.

I’ve been fortunate to have spent this part of my journey with all of you,

and I want to take a moment to express my gratitude.



First, a heartfelt thank-you to @Jama Musse <jama.musse@hellofresh.ca>:

Your clarity of thought, sense of direction, and depth as a product leader

have shaped my own practice more than you know. I’m leaving here having

learned a tremendous amount from you, about strategy, about leadership, and

about what it means to build with purpose. And @Annie Meininghaus

<anne@hellofresh.com>, thank you as well, for your empathy to our users,

your steadiness, and the way you make complexity feel navigable.



To @James Villacci <james.villacci@hellofresh.com> who's built an

*unparalleled* world-class UXR practice (with incredible researchers such

as @Andrea Henry <andrea.henry@hellofresh.com>, @Caitlin Carlson

<caitlin.carlson@hellofresh.com>, & @Alice Wang <alice.wang@hellofresh.com>

) & @Daniel O'Connell <doco@hellofresh.com> who is literally a magical

swiss army knife of expertise, the incredible Bad-Boy of Design™ @Brian Lin

<brian.lin@hellofresh.ca> who has been our secret s

... [TRUNCATED: 3268 chars omitted] ...

 for

the people who made this journey meaningful. Thank you for everything. I

genuinely wish each of you continued growth, purpose, and good success

ahead.



In my next chapter, I will dedicate myself to building a new branch of

science at the Utorics Institute <https://utorics.com/>, where I'll teach

and conduct cognitive quantum-behaviour research.



Wishing you all the very best, David

Summary



Nikita Gorshkov provided updates on PA support, noting Simon's increased  

visibility and contingent interviews with five independent contractors,  

while Maria Chelminska confirmed Tishia would be dedicated to TPT, Good  

Job, and VMS if hired. Maria Chelminska is working on business cases to  

provide evidence for OKR numbers, with Nikita Gorshkov emphasizing CVA  

impact over strict numerical accuracy, and Maria Chelminska expecting to  

understand overall goal achievement by the end of the current week. Maria  

Chelminska raised the long time to significance for experiments, with  

Farane suggesting the use of leading indicators or micro conversions to  

shorten this time, which Maria Chelminska noted would require more PA  

support and could face pushback, but Nikita Gorshkov agreed it makes sense  

for small experiments. Maria Chelminska stressed the need for an analyst to  

translate micro conversion impact to key metrics, but Nikita Gorshkov  

suggested focusing on overall business numbers like net revenue, AOU, and  

weekly active users, making assumptions about correlations between metrics.





Suggested next steps





Maria Chelminska will look into things, run the business cases, and make  

evidence on the OKR numbers by calculating the launches in the doc that are  

the most valid and have the biggest expected impact, to understand if the  

OKR is done this week.
