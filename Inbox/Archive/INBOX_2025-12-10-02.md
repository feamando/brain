BRD: (🥇MVP) Cross-Selling as Market Integration; Recurring Multi-Subscription (1.0)

	Summary: An outline of requirements for the creation of the Cross-Selling as Market Integration MVP.

	Created At: Jan 1, 2025

	Last Updated: (See individual tabs)

	



	Editor(s): Leo LeeNikita Gorshkov

	Initial WBD: Cross-Selling: Enable HF US customers to purchase single order(s) or recurring Factor meals through a “Market Integration” experience

	Purpose

The purpose of the document is to provide teams across HelloFresh responsible for the delivery of the Cross-Selling as Market Integration experience (Top-5 Company Strategy #5) in 2025: Serve more household meal moments with a customer-centric, integrated RTE & Meal Kit offering that increases Average Order Rate (AOR) at reduced Customer Acquisition Costs (CACs) with a clear set of requirements for the MVP launch. 

Recap

As of W1-2025, the HelloFresh US Physical Product team has begun testing the inclusion of Ready Made Meals on the HF-US Core Menu. These meals are supplied by a third-party vendor and shipped as part of the same standard HelloFresh meal-kit box. However, our team’s objective is to continue experimenting with cross-selling strategies and explore alternate models to ultimately gather enough insights in 2025 to provide a recommendation for 2026 peak and beyond. We are referring to this strategy as “Market Integration,” which specifically involves utilizing Factor-produced RTE (Ready-to-Eat) meals as our physical product offering.





Target Market: HelloFresh US 🇺🇸

Market Integration 2025 High Level Milestone

1. [MVP Release] Opt-in model via a secondary, recurring RTE subscription; Multi-subscription set-up.

Future Roadmap 2026+

2. Refactor experience onto new Actives Journey revamp - Migrate  MVP experience in Native onto the new AJ flows in React Native.

3. Iterative Improvements - On-going refinement and enhancement of our cross-selling experience. TBD product scope.

Goals

* Provide all teams involved in execution with a complete set of MVP requirements for delivery

* Reduce ambiguity around dependencies and scope of work across teams

* Drive alignment on the MVP experience for launch

* Reduce project complexity to empower teams to execute

Non-Goals

* Provide overviews or recommendations for post-MVP interactions or launch

* Provide operational execution details or requirements

* Open items for debate or further discussions outside of existing product discovery workstreams

Document Navigation

a.misola@hellofresh.ca does the word Receipt IMPLY it's a confirmed transaction? I wonder if we need to use some other language

[fl]Haha, i just had a curiosity because i know the business, but yes, maybe we just need a better content instead of receipt, like "Order summary" or something like that.

[fm]@leo.lee@hellofresh.ca how will the receipt look when one brand is skipped ? Will it have any mention of the skipped brand ?

Because in HF, if users are skipped, we do not show the cart/order summary.

[fn]Yeah it should only show for non-skipped meals.





That said, cc @katerina.scoullos@hellofresh.com @arbaaz.dossani@hellofresh.com is that reflected in our ticket





@allysa.misola@hellofresh.ca Are we then adding more permutations in copy if people:

Just order MK, just Order RTE?

[fo]Ooh! Great call out on the permutations! I'm gonna add that as a topic but it would be helpful to call out just X brand for the single orders!

[fp]@tricia.mcgleam@factor75.com, @frankie.hernandez@hellofresh.com & @sanyuja.mahajan@factor75.com Thank you for your time today. I wanted to outline the ask, process and pain points from our call today. Can you please take a moment to look this over and confirm if I have understood your points correctly? Thank you! cc: @leo.lee@hellofresh.ca

[fq]and to be clear: FJ menu ops is not able to take on the manual management across FJ and x-sell

[fr]Just to confirm since it's not specified here, we're excluding add-ons right?

[fs]What about preferences? Are they same for US and FJ? And slots?

[ft]@leo.lee@hellofresh.ca correct me, because my data might be obsolete; but the idea was that we would use the HFUS preferences; so we would need to map the FJ recipes to HF preferences. 





THat said we did something similar for cross-brands, right @arbaaz.dossani@hellofresh.com for v3?

[fu]We descoped it for v3

[fv]For opt-in MVP, it doesn't really matte because pre-selection is a fixed step. We also don't call out F_ preferences in Opt-out ever. I'd pick the path that is creates less problems for us from the culinary tool side and the front end side.





For opt-out, we could go both ways, I can think of pros/cons for both, but we can land on it later

[fw]we could also just schedule a run, no? basically: 

1. check if menu for DW exists every day

2. if yes - trigger call

3. if no - nada

💡 Meeting Notes [To be filled after the Review Meeting by the YP Document Owner and sent out via email to attendees. This section does not impact the maximum number of pages]

Review Meeting Date: Oct 16, 2025

Attendees: Jama MusseCho HwangAnnie MeininghausCho HwangHolger HammelDominik RichterEd BoyesAssaf RonenLaurent GuillemainSeb TronFabien SimonAdriana VillarBrian Leung





Key Takeaways, Decisions, and Next Steps:

1. Alignment needed with Adam Park on plan for Factor Programs, as it fell below the line for Q4 and Q1. Does this need to be reprioritized? Done, we have agreed to keep momentum on physical product as well as planning ahead of Q2 development relaunch 

2. Factor Tech prioritization list created by Adam Park needs to be reviewed against the backlog of the MD squad. Done, we have reviewed the incremental asks, and have pulled them into Ed squad prioritization, and flagged items already in YP’s 

3. Lack of analytics resourcing was highlighted as risk for New Ventures, Annie and Jama to take away and come back with Analytics resourcing plans for New Ventures We have added 1 incremental PA resource to the New Ventures domain space, and will be looking to move additional temporary capacity to reduce the outstanding backlog 

4. Factor Form should better connect their products to customers  goals to create a “personalized performance stack”. Jama to connect with Adam Park on this plan We have added this for exploration in Q3 plan 

5. An aligned strategy should be created on how Loyalty should work for the New Ventures, and should this connect to the New Loyalty strategy set to launch in Q2-Q3 We will be looking to leverage the New Loyalty program when it launches, so we have therefore moved loyalty for Pets Table back by 1 quarter into Q3   

6. Cross Selling for other brands outside of HelloFresh and Factor is below the line for 2026 to be revisited for 2027 planning









Changes requested to the Yearly Plan during Draft Reviews. Please update before submission for final YP approval:  

* Move Loyalty on Pets Table by 1 quarter to Q3 to leverage  New Loyalty program launch 

* App Launch for Pets Table to become contingent on results of Elysium and ABBA app launches (both financial and performance KPIs)













	I. Organizational Overview

Mission and Focus areas

The New Ventures team aims to surprise and delight customers by bringing to life never-before-seen physical and digital products, changing the way everyone thinks about food. The domain scope for new ventures includes: Good Chop - delivering US consumers premium, locally sourced proteins via a digital butcher experience; The Pets Table - delicious and nutritious human-grade pet food for pet parents for all budgets and sizes & the Factor sub-brand Factor Form - supporting customers on their path towards holistic wellness and achieving their health goals;  Market Innovation - bringing customers brand new experiences across markets reinvigorating our relevance in their eyes.





Current Organizational Structure

The funded fixed HC for the New Ventures is 50. The management structure consists of 1 Director of Engineering (Daniel Arias) and 1 Director of Product (Nikita Gorshkov). Over the course of Q4 teams will settle into the new squad structure.  Overall New Ventures have self-funded with the exception of +2 from Growth to fund the Market Innovation squad.  *Final 2026 HC budget is under review with Finance and Portfolio given the recent org changes.

Why does it need to be country by country and not a global launch ?  

Voice dictated by Assaf 

 

Sent from my iPhone

[g]The technology is available globally, the rollouts are happening as the countries define their occasions and setup and procure the SKUs.

[h]what would you like to see here but aren't right now? @lgui@thepetstable.com

_Assigned to lgui@thepetstable.com_

[i]1. Multipet checkout improvements (direct impact on improving AOR)

2. Increasing add on % of net revenue through add on subscribe & save, product marketing & UX (goal to increase add ons as a % of NR from 1% to 5% in 2026)

3. Other CVR initiatives e.g. testing other qus in the quiz (previous pet food, neutered/spayed, etc), personalised value reinforcing stats, etc

4. RAF initiatives on Tiered credit based on loyalty; RAF social proof & CVR improvements -> one of our goals for 2026 is to step change RAF





The team have this long list of initiatives and we will prioritise them through our quarterly planning.





The key thing is that we are resourced to tackle the vast majority of these and we've aligned on the resourcing for that. I can share with you in our call on Tuesday

[j]Aligned with Laurent on this, we have a good understanding of the overall capacity needs with the team based on the available initiative roadmap; this particular table/format was not aimed to be exhaustive of all of the work we aim to deliver in 2026.

[k]whats most painful to see not on the list @yt@hellofresh.com @set@hellofresh.com

_Assigned to yt@hellofresh.com_

[l]all key topics are in here. 





one stream that's not present in here but we have as part of objectives and currently actively exploring is modernized CX leveraging AI: we are now looking at a few solutions that would augment CC, support sales funnel with live Q&A as well as retention flow (i.e. replace cancellation flow with native chat experience and go off the cancellation reason - solution) - this would need team support (data ingestion, PM steering, etc)

Dec 5, 2025 | Hamed:Nikita 1:1

Attendees: Nikita Gorshkov Hamed Karimian





Notes

* OTP Launch → decision: to have FF turn on in W02, but everything should be ready by EOY





Options

	Pros

	Cons

	Decision

	Launch W50

	More time before AD/ND

Time to iterate if issues

Time to rollout gradually





	Won’t make it! 

Less time for e2e testing

	No Go

	Launch W51 (To 90% of users)

	Original plan

On-track from dev pov

Captures business value earlier (~$15k in revenue)





	Super risky as most devs are out (Jordon, Jan, Edwin, Emily, Daniel, Travis)

Super close to EOY

Might break something on Factor

Not enough time for gradual rollout

On-calls: Emily Stanek (W50), Paul Andrews (W51/52)

	Maybe

	Launch W51 

(To only 10%)

	Mitigates the risk

Collects some feedback before the peak

	Still risky (Not enough devs to support)

Limited business impact





	No Go

	Launch W02

(To 90% of users)

	Less risky (Devs available for support)

Still before the actual peak

Won’t break anything on Factor/FF

	Delayed launch

Opportunity cost





	Go! 

	  W46 2024 - W04 2025 → The market is pretty soft over the last few weeks of the year

* Mobile app prototype

   * Who’s the owner of Factor App? → Shopping experience () & Merchandizing (Elisa Marku Laura Mneimneh) 

* Early & Often slides

* Shopify redirects → We might change that in the future depending on the number of redirects

   * Net New users: from legacy to shopify

   * RTE users: from Shopify to legacy





Action items

* 



Dec 2, 2025 | Hamed:Nikita 1:1

ckable only — no code).





Recruit 10–15 representative users (existing customers or target personas).





Ask them to choose between:





Current “build-your-own” flow





The new “plan-based” flow





Ask follow-ups:





Which feels more tailored to you?





Which would you trust more?





How likely are you to purchase?





✅ Advantages: Fast qualitative signal; surfaces objections early.

💡 Tip: Use Figma Analytics or Maze metrics (time on screen, clicks) for light quant data.





Option 3: “Fake Door” Test in Live Site





Goal: Measure real interest from actual users without building full functionality.





On your live PLP or homepage, add a new section or banner:





“Introducing our new lifestyle plans — Performance, Focus, and Foundation.”

CTA: “Explore Plans.”





When users click, send them to a “Coming Soon” page or a short survey:





“We’re launching soon — tell us which plan interests you most.”





Measure clicks, plan preference, and sign-ups for early access.





✅ Advantages: True behavioral data from live traffic.

💡 Tip: Works well if your current site already gets meaningful volume.





Option 4: Email or CRM Campaign Test





Goal: Validate resonance of messaging and pricing.





Segment your customer base (athletes, busy professionals, general wellness).





Send A/B email variants — one promoting current product set, one promoting “plans.”





Measure CTR, click-to-checkout, or pre-order intent.





✅ Advantages: Zero dev time, quick pulse check on messaging effectiveness.





📊 How to Evaluate Results

Metric        Signal        Success Criteria

CTR / engagement        Do users click into plan-based offers more than product-based ones?        +15–20% vs. baseline

Intent (survey or fake door)        Are users more likely to say they’d subscribe?        Majority (>60%) positive

AOV (simulated)        When choosing a plan, is average intended spend higher?        +10–15% lift

Qualitative sentiment        Do users say the plan feels easier, more relevant, or trustworthy?        Positive pattern emerges





If 2–3 of these indicators trend positively, that’s a green light to justify design + dev investment for a live experiment.





🚀 Recommended Next Step (Low-Effort, High-Insight)





Build a simple Figma prototype with your three plans + “Choose Plan” CTA, and test it via qualitative plan. (Option 2)

Nov 26, 2025 | The Pets Table weekly Check-in

Action items from last time

* Ahmed Wagdi to share screenshots with Anisha of Project Heaven 

* Ahmed Wagdito confirm if C@C can be enabled for reactivation

* Ahmed Wagdito align with Daniel about contractor budget for 2026





Notes

e're trying to address this for the VMS experience and working with Gabi and Ryan to get a clearer setup for attribution and tracking in cases of multisubscription users.

[x]Note for Self: they are modifying the conversion event.

[y]@aw@hellofresh.com

[z]@lgui@hellofresh.com FYI for updates

[aa]Replied under each question

[ab]Thansk Ahmed!

[ac]notes! please add anything I've missed @lgui@hellofresh.co.uk @wellney.yarra@hellofresh.com @anisha.chandra@hellofresh.com @aw@hellofresh.com

[ad]https://hellofresh.atlassian.net/browse/TPT-480

[ae]@anisha.chandra@hellofresh.com do you agree this is the right statement for AAFCO?





@dovas@hellofresh.com FYI

_Assigned to anisha.chandra@hellofresh.com_

[af]This is the official statement "formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the

AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials) Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for All Life Stages, including growth of large size dogs (70 lbs. or more as an adult)"

[ag]If we need shorter, then I'm ok shortening to what NOM Nom have in their FAQ which is "Recipes meet standards set by AAFCO’s Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for all life stages."

[ah]@wellney.yarra@hellofresh.com - does it all go through you, or we can also add tix?

[ai]should we move the existing UI fix tickets to this epic?

[aj]@bowang.dai@hellofresh.ca have you had a chance to check this one?

_Assigned to _

[ak]Sorry, didn't get a chance to speak to this yesterday! Yes! I have reach out to squad consumer core. They have updated the reporting tab is no longer a supported feature. They only way to see recent conversions is via the DWH.

[al]I am currently reaching out to global BI to see how this information is pulled from DWH and which report pulls this information.

[am]FYI @dovas@hellofresh.com 





Thanks Bo!!

[an]gotcha - thanks you. maybe you can check if we can use "marketing report extract" from tableau?

[ao]Sorry team for missing this meeting as I was off. @dovas@hellofresh.com and @wellney.yarra@hellofresh.com is this the finalized RAF Values? 50% off the trial box and 20% off on the next two boxes? Is this correct?

[ap]Hey! Nope these were just example of the first box discount. For RAF it will be 100% off trial box, just pay for shipping and a TBD credit customer will earn for successful referrals

﻿Dec 10, 2025

1. Round robin download:

   1. Jama catching up, Q1 planning happy and has more plans for personalisation with Tushar

   2. Mert, not super comfy because refinement and dependency followups needed - Mert has session in flight for next week. 

      1. Generally, Mert would like to undercommit,and deliver rather than risking overcommitting and under delivering. He is following up with PMs

      2. CTA have your top 3 items per team (be dogmatic ) and be sure the are the right top three, anything after that it’s ok to drop or fail

   3. Gabriel, flag fragments between new org structure and old lack of structure. Meaning it’s now hard to get clarity as there is no experience on what is needed for Elysium KTLO. This will impact realistic Q1 estimates but will get better with time, now it’s partly guesswork

   4. Fernando raises concerns on Personalisation, no roadmap that he knows of. Tushar is planning for this especially with Search (Jama said so, and then Tushar said so too) - overall still figuring it out and hyper aware of AI and GridDynamics solution. Fernando flagging that as we learn more, like reprios needed

      1. Holger: happy with EOQ working search outcome[a], potential shared wins with Remy and cookbook

      2. Personalisation excluding search (Fernando’s root concern): eg a for you personalised widget needs a BE

         1. Mert clarifies that new For You category is ‘this weeks menu’ category using Food Systems logic

         2. Jama Musse on followups for future meetings on this topic

   5. Nikita, TPT conversion / retention split should 1:1:1 indication be there?

      1. The gotya is these aren’t just squads but rather business, so 1:1:1 can’t always apply - autonomous calibration based on needs recommended, base on top prios

      2. If hitting wall, escalate

   6. Priyank, has a new KPI proposal  Shopping Platform - Vision 2026/KPIs  Miro

      1. CTA comment on the doc

   7. Jenna, backfilling David for New Ventures

      1. Will open Marina backfill for GoodChop

   8. Jama flagged pressure on Elysium timeline on rollouts for WL UMK brands, all want to get to 500 meals ASAP

      1. CTA Taking offline MErt, Gabriel and Jama connect

   9. Adhoc market launch M&As coming up:

      1. 2-3 weeks likely coming in the door

      2. Factor Market launching in FR EOY 2026

         1. TBD what team does this sit with now

            1. Fernando recommends agentic launch :P 

   10. Mert raises cancellation funnel ownership:

      1. 



2. (Holger) Sprint review, tribe demos

   1. CTA 5th Jan expectation that everyone starts

   2. Reporting Week 2, 4, 6, etc

   3. Nikita investigating automation for a bunch of this

3. (Holger) Client platform / Acceleration topics: CI pipeline, Localisation, RN migration, Web unification, snowplow, accessibility

4. Meta Backlog for Q1 decided MBL candidates: Q1-2026





Nov 19, 2025

2. Any blockers / support needed for P500?

   1. Ongoing updates in Slack

   2. P500 - Shopping Foundations and Journeys 

3. Elysium status update

4. Team channels: Please cross reference to ensure nobody from your teams is left out 👀

   1. #consumer-mega-alliance

   2. #cma-shopping-new-ventures-team

5. Early and Often update

   1. Every Thursday, fixed slot. Product and Design feedback round, Jenna + Jama attendance promised ;) 

   2. #cma-shopping-new-ventures-feedback



(P500 Menu planning) P500 planning ramp-up
