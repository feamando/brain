Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Beatrice Dimarucut and Nikita Gorshkov discussed HelloFresh's app-first approach for new features like merchandising tiles on Ellesium, clarifying that code reuse between web and mobile requires features to be built in a specific way, although all backend logic should be reusable. The participants addressed confusion around charge checkout issues and the cancel/refund functionalities during the AL migration, noting that performing one action makes the other option unavailable. Nikita Gorshkov suggested looping in Shay or creating documentation to clarify the charge checkout flows for AL, which Beatrice Dimarucut agreed is necessary for documenting expected AL behavior despite current workarounds with Bob.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* HelloFresh App First Approach and Code Sharing Beatrice Dimarucut reported on a chat with Merit regarding HelloFresh's shopping journey, merchandising, and personalization, noting their app-first approach for new features like merchandising tiles on Ellesium (00:00:00). Nikita Gorshkov emphasized that if they were to reuse code between web and mobile, as the new infrastructure allows, the features would need to be built in a specific way (00:01:20). Beatrice Dimarucut clarified that because the new code is being written for both web and app simultaneously, they should be able to reuse some parts of it, including all backend logic (00:02:17).

* Issues with Charge Checkout in AL Migration Beatrice Dimarucut expressed doubt about increasing the charge checkout allocation due to potential issues, which they plan to discuss with Ahmed. Nikita Gorshkov clarified that the cancel option does not cancel the order itself, but the payment processing of the order (00:03:32). Both speakers discussed the confusion around the cancel and refund functionalities, noting that if one action is taken first (cancel or refund), the option for the other disappears (00:04:32).

* Charge Checkout Documentation and Confusion Nikita Gorshkov suggested looping in Shay or creating a document to clarify the flows for charge checkout, expressing confusion over the processes, especially with the AL migration (00:04:32). Beatrice Dimarucut noted that the payment team initially implemented charge checkout through Bob, and the current confusion is due to the AL migration (00:05:26). They further detailed that the refund process works via AL through the orders tab or by refunding first, but not via the error reporting tool that agents are trained to use for good shop (00:06:31).

* Documenting Charge Checkout Flows in AL Beatrice Dimarucut summarized the remaining confusion: if a refund works, how to cancel the box, and if the box is canceled, why the refund option is missing (00:07:31). Nikita Gorshkov outlined a documentation approach to map the flow, including order states (pre- and post-cutoff), payment states (BAU and CC), AL actions (cancel, refund), and results (00:08:46). Beatrice Dimarucut acknowledged that while Bob is a current workaround, they need to focus on documenting what is expected for AL, as the company will not revert to Bob (00:10:38).





Suggested next steps

* Beatrice Dimarucut will ask about reusing the backend services for HelloFresh.

* Nikita Gorshkov will create a document to loop in Shay and detail what Al is planning for charger checkout when it scales, given the confusion around current flows and issues.

* Beatrice Dimarucut will do

... [TRUNCATED: 10129 chars omitted to save context] ...

 you first do the other thing even via Bob?

 

 

00:08:46

 

Beatrice Dimarucut: It doesn't matter. I'm going to document this.

Nikita Gorshkov: Wait,

Beatrice Dimarucut: I think this

Nikita Gorshkov: wait, wait, wait. No, just I think so. We don't need to even uh do it as a uh so here we

Beatrice Dimarucut: is

Nikita Gorshkov: have pre cutff. So, okay, wait. Uh state order state payment state CC L action one or action first action second

Beatrice Dimarucut: Mhm.

Nikita Gorshkov: action um okay and then order state is pre uh cutoff because that's an order state.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Mhm.

Nikita Gorshkov: Post cutoff uh then payment state uh C uh well actually BAU and see right.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Mhm. Yeah. So those are like Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yep. And then here it will always be

Beatrice Dimarucut: Um

Nikita Gorshkov: uh um drop down. Uh cancel uh refund. Anything else?

Beatrice Dimarucut: I mean th those are like what are you trying to do with like the owl action like you're trying to dictate what should be possible or what is

Nikita Gorshkov: I'm trying to document what's the flow.

 

 

00:10:38

 

Nikita Gorshkov: No.

Beatrice Dimarucut: possible.

Nikita Gorshkov: And uh here we just have results.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Ah okay. Okay. I think we also need some Bob columns just to compare it

Nikita Gorshkov: Uh but but no,

Beatrice Dimarucut: maybe.

Nikita Gorshkov: but so they're not going to u revert back to Bob, right? That's the reality that we have to live with.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah. Okay. Fair.

Nikita Gorshkov: Uh so we need to show them.

Beatrice Dimarucut: I I mean the only reason why I'm talking about Bob right now is because that's the workaround we need to do

Nikita Gorshkov: Uhhuh.

Beatrice Dimarucut: if we want to increase allocation right now. But yeah. Okay.

Nikita Gorshkov: Mhm.

Beatrice Dimarucut: You're trying to just do you're just trying to show them for Al what should

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah. Exactly.

Beatrice Dimarucut: be.

Nikita Gorshkov: Uh order states. Actually, we need to just have this as another dropdown. Uh

Beatrice Dimarucut: So pre-cut off post cut off.

Nikita Gorshkov: pretty. And then uh okay. Mhm. Yep. Mhm.

If the cell is highlighted with ‘This KR is associated with KTLO but we believe it delivers benefit and results in the creation of assets. Please advise',  you need to help us map this KR to an economic benefit.

If the cell is highlighted with ‘KR not found on the OKR Tool’, please help us map days reported to another KR."

,"C - Change value in column M - C. Percentage of work reported in cap activities YTD that is actually capitalisable if the KR is set to not meet or canceled, if it is partially capitalisable, or if there is need to ensure teams are not reporting non-capitalisable activities.

Summary



Beatrice Dimarucut and Nikita Gorshkov discussed HelloFresh's app-first  

approach for new features like merchandising tiles on Ellesium, clarifying  

that code reuse between web and mobile requires features to be built in a  

specific way, although all backend logic should be reusable. The  

participants addressed confusion around charge checkout issues and the  

cancel/refund functionalities during the AL migration, noting that  

performing one action makes the other option unavailable. Nikita Gorshkov  

suggested looping in Shay or creating documentation to clarify the charge  

checkout flows for AL, which Beatrice Dimarucut agreed is necessary for  

documenting expected AL behavior despite current workarounds with Bob.





Suggested next steps





Beatrice Dimarucut will ask about reusing the backend services for  

HelloFresh.



Nikita Gorshkov will create a document to loop in Shay and detail what Al  

is planning for charger checkout when it scales, given the confusion around  

current flows and issues.



Beatrice Dimarucut will document all charge checkout issues, including the  

difference in refund options via Al (orders tab vs. error reporting) and  

the necessary sequence of steps for pre-cut off orders.
