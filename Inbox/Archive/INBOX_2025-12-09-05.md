Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Nikita Gorshkov and Jama Musse discussed several key organizational and project updates, including Tishia’s secured budget approval and Jama Musse's approval for an 18-month analytics support contract role, separate from a permanent product role, while also addressing Alexia's contract inquiry and the unexpected termination of Sharief following a mistake by his manager, Assaf. Discussions also covered David's anticipated departure during the reorg, concerns about Katrina's aggressive pursuit of a VP promotion, and the January 5th launch of the OTP plus subscribe and save feature for factor 4, along with vendor management issues regarding Anata attempting to offload subscription setup work onto Samir. Other topics included the prioritization of the Ed roadmap, where Jama Musse explained Ed's escalating pressure to meet market demands, and the critical need for B2B product support to address HIPPA compliance issues related to "factor food as medicine stuff."





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Staffing and Contract Roles Nikita Gorshkov confirmed that budget approvals for Tishia were secured from Lauron and Yuri. Following this, Nikita Gorshkov asked Jama Musse if they could proceed with an 18-month contract, similar to Yara's, for an analytics support role, which Jama Musse approved, stating "Let's do it". Jama Musse clarified that two separate roles are opening: a contract role and a permanent, full-time product role, emphasizing they are different functions and everyone needs to be aware (00:01:07).

* Follow-up with Alexia and Sharief's Departure Jama Musse instructed Nikita Gorshkov to close the loop with Alexia regarding the contract role, as themself had sent an inquiry while Jama Musse was on vacation. The speakers then discussed Sharief's unexpected departure, with Jama Musse explaining that Sharief’s manager, Assaf, was unhappy with Sharief and subsequently made a mistake that created an issue for the organization, which led to Sharief's termination to "solve the trouble problem" (00:02:02). Jama Musse suggested that Sharief was likely okay with the outcome, preferring to be "paid to leave versus to just quit," given the difficult relationship with Assaf (00:04:25).

* David's Departure and Reorganization The conversation shifted to David, with Jama Musse noting that David had slowed down over the last year, particularly after having a baby, but still expected top performer treatment during the reorg (00:05:57). Nikita Gorshkov noted that it was understandable if it was time for David to part ways after five and a half years (00:06:43). The speakers also addressed the "problem with Marlene" that Katrina was causing, with Jama Musse warning Nikita Gorshkov to watch out for Katrina, who is aggressively seeking a VP promotion and causing "spin" for the team by trying to reinstitute Dominic reviews for more FaceTime with Dominic (00:07:37).

* Product Launch and Vendor Management Nikita Gorshkov provided an update that the OTP plus subscribe and save feature for factor 4 is scheduled to launch on January 5th (calendar week two) to align with the expected pickup in peak traffic (00:09:35). Jama Musse and Nikita Gorshkov discussed the Shopify project, where Nikita Gorshkov expressed satisfaction with Allison's performance but noted that Anata, the consultancy being paid $400,000, was attempting to offload some of the subscription setup work onto Samir, which Nikita Gorshkov insis

n org to be like, "Guys, we yeah, we understand it's Christmas, but not only do we not we want you to work, we also want your weekends over these holidays,

Nikita Gorshkov: 996.

Jama Musse: too." There

Nikita Gorshkov: Yes. 996. Uh, shareholder f****** value. Um, this is what I wish for Christmas.

Jama Musse: you go.

Nikita Gorshkov: Um, cool.

Jama Musse: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: You had the last topic for one minute. I have my next Mhm.

Jama Musse: Yeah. So, so I don't know how to handle this.

 

 

00:18:38

 

Jama Musse: I'm just bringing it to your radar, but um they want some product support from us on the B2B side. they are running into some hiccups in like with things like HIPPA compliance and things of that nature with the work that they're trying to do on the the factor food as medicine stuff and like the the selling the food into like the old age homes and things that they're trying to do in the B2B space.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yes. Yep.

Jama Musse: And so apparently because our products don't have we don't we're not listing the right type of information in order to meet HIPPA compliance.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah.

Jama Musse: We have to do something about it. They don't know what they have to do yet and they don't know the how. But like they're now panicking and they reached out to me and they're like HIPPA compliance like so we need I think we just need to sit down with them and understand what they need. I'm not saying we deliver it because we don't have a team to deliver it. But like the first step is like figure out what's going on, which I don't think they they know.

Nikita Gorshkov: But okay, sounds good. That's what she was referring to. Okay. Um, my question is, can't they consolidate this?

Jama Musse: Who's she? Who's she? Who's the she when you said that?

Nikita Gorshkov: Elena. Elena.

Jama Musse: No. No. This is a completely different. So this is on the other side with Adam Park and um Kieran.

Nikita Gorshkov: Oh, okay.

Jama Musse: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: Okay.

Jama Musse: Anyway, I gota I gotta jump.

Nikita Gorshkov: Okay. Okay. So, just FYI, uh, in regards to that, don't they have Shopify? So, can't we modify the PDP so it it does include all the s***?

New T&C Disclaimers for Activation / Reactivation

Author: Tommaso Cremonini

Updated Apr 24, 2025





TL:DR[a]

The new disclaimer copy, mandatory consent checkbox, and revised disclosure order have led to a -10.9% drop in gross activations, equivalent to €72.8M loss in annual CVA. As expected, there was a statistically significant decrease in the share of cancelling customers (-17.1%) but we will need a few more days to see how much this will improve net activations compared to the gross activation drop. These findings highlight the need for urgent adjustments to mitigate these adverse effects before the FTC ruling's effective date (14-May).





Summary

Experimentation dates

	Variant

	Screen

	Disclaimer

	n/a

	Live now (control)

	  



	By clicking "Place order & select meals", I agree to the Terms and Conditions, the Privacy Policy, and the weekly auto-renewal price of $64.93 after my discount period. I can cancel my plan anytime in my account at least 5 days prior to my next delivery.

	Button Behavior

	Subscription button disabled if:

- payment method is not inserted and validated

	04/25 - 05/6

	Experiment #3

	  

  



	Disclaimer

	I agree to the Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy. I also agree that my plan will auto-renew at $29.99/week once my discount ends. I can cancel anytime in my account at least 5 days before my next delivery.

	Hypotheses

	It refines the consent process by integrating concise auto-renewal details directly into the disclaimer text and moving away from Experiment #2's more forceful disclaimer highlighting. This iteration reorders the disclaimer, placing the auto-renewal terms after the acceptance of the general T&C and PP, a pattern observed in other US subscription models like Marley Spoon or Home Chef, potentially reducing initial hesitation.

	Button Behavior

	Subscription button is disabled if: 

- payment method is not inserted and validated

- disclaimer checkbox is not selected 





If the checkbox is not marked and the subscription button is clicked, an error message is highlighted above the subscription button. 





Moved the Satisfaction guarantee banner between the payment container and the disclaimer

	I agree to the weekly auto-renewal price of $29.99 after my discount period ends. I can cancel my plan anytime in my account at least 5 days prior to my next delivery. I also agree to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.

	Hypotheses

	Var 1: building on exp#1, this variation replaces the alarming static red alert message with a dynamic error message that appears only when the user attempts to proceed without checking the box. The hypothesis here is that by removing the upfront visual friction of the red alert, we can reduce user anxiety and encourage more users to complete the checkout process, while still ensuring compliance through the clear error feedback.









Var 2: highlighting the entire disclaimer when the user hasn't checked the box is a very direct way to ensure the user acknowledges the terms. However, this method carries the risk of drawing excessive atte

ullet form needs same express copy re: both actions.

--> next proposed variant

[n]What about accessibility concerns here btw? Screen readers will definitely not play nice with this. Sorry just realized as I was updating the mobile mocks. @tommaso.cremonini@hellofresh.com @sherief.helaifi-chadha@hellofresh.com

[o]That's a separate legal risk, and we have already settled several accessibility demand letters/class actions, so this risk needs to be considered, regardless of relatively how few sign up on desktop.

[p]Outside counsel: For one-off single purchase followed by separate/compliant AR disclosure consent: if one-off customer decides not to enroll, then only send initial box, and don't subscribe/email customer.

--> An option in the long term, recommendation to tie together with monetization model work stream

[q]@brian.lin@hellofresh.ca added even this option:

separate dialog with the question to accept the multi-box discount in exchange for the autorenewal acceptance

[r]_Marked as resolved_

[s]_Re-opened_

[t]Sorry forgot to respond. Liking this as a variant! I have a version post-checkout, this would be a more (shorter-term) pre-checkout variant.

[u]@thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com let's discuss in the call what options we have. can the CTA remain enabled even without checkbox to make sure people click, and solve this through error message attention?

[v]Not sure what you mean by 'remain enabled' -- customer should NOT be able to advance by clicking it, unless and until customer has checked box. But yes, CTA can remain live/green, as long as a non-box-checking customer who clicks it cannot advance, always gets the error message, and can only advance with click if box has been checked.

[w]@sherief.helaifi-chadha@hellofresh.com @thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com @dalia.eid@hellofresh.com is this copy (as is) mandatory or is there an opportunity to adjust for tone and clarity without losing legal intent or FTC compliance ... for example, something like: "I understand my plan auto-renews at $XX.XX/week after the discount ends. I can cancel anytime in my account, at least 5 days before my next delivery. I agree to the [Terms and Conditions] and [Privacy Policy]."

[x]No, not express and affirmative consent required by FTC rule.

Upcoming FTC Negative Option Rule (Federal Register :: Negative Option Rule, rule starts at 24734)





SUMMARY: dramatic expansion of current requirements for auto-renewing subscriptions, which we have been working with industry groups to push back, via comments submitted to FTC.

... [TRUNCATED: 24950 chars omitted to save context] ...

 brief analysis here?

_Assigned to thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com_

[aw]Variation 5: FBFL here would violate the draft Rule, which prohibits including any information that “interferes with, detracts from, contradicts, or otherwise undermines the consumer's ability to provide express informed consent.”

[ax]@thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com Same for this

_Assigned to thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com_

[ay]@thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com @dalia.eid@hellofresh.com what can we do here in terms of value props

_Assigned to thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com_

[az]Q in to outside counsel

[ba]Feedback from outside counsel: Defensible position as long as value prop relates to the subscription (element or term of subscription) (but not only a marketing value prop, for example, could not say "save 30%).

[bb]Could alternatively state "cancel anytime" as a value prop

[bc]Thank you! What about something like "we will remind you via email before auto-renewal"?

[bd]Yes, that is an autorenew element/term

[be]@thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com @dalia.eid@hellofresh.com

[bf]Sticky CTA variation

[bg]defensible, considered compliant by outside counsel

[bh]@dalia.eid@hellofresh.com @thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com can we say "slide to agree & select meals"

_Assigned to dalia.eid@hellofresh.com_

[bi]considered defensible/compliant by outside counsel

[bj](1) Change "Do you Agree with our Terms &Conditions" to "How our Subscription Work"  and also (2) change "by clicking  checkout" to "by clicking "place order & select meals".

[bk]More variations added here @thomas.cohn@hellofresh.com @dalia.eid@hellofresh.com

[bl]considered compliant/defensible by outside counsel

[bm]as mentioned above: can we find markets where such a rule is already in effect and we can find inspiration

[bn]@naseem.hasan@hellofresh.com didn't they also have a slider?

[bo]They use the slide button for a one-time purchase when you hit "Buy Now" on an item.

[bp]Interesting, so exactly the opposite of the new rule requirement 🤔

[bq]@naseem.hasan@hellofresh.com could you add this here as well as an example? I can't find the figma link anymore, sorry

Purpose,

,Overview of the Product & Engineering organization and members of the Consumer mega alliance. Complementing the limited views from workday and adaptive.

Context,

,The actual source of truth remains Workday for all employee data and reporting lines

,"In many cases managers have to have a way to plan ahead, to get an overview over a larger part of the org, to add more data like what programming languages someone can contribute in or a logical grouoping by triebs and squads. To avoid that everyone has to do the same work and to keep track of relevant metrics we maintain this central sheet for the whole alliance (Product, engineering)."

,The sheet is only shared with CS8+ managers. 

,For questions contact Holger Hammel

Main sheet - CMA,

,Please always use Filter views

,"CS8+ Tribe leads are responsible to keep the sheet up to date. This includes timely updates to status, dates of contract changes, reporting & squad assignments"

,TBD: how to sync and spot conflicts btw workday and adaptive and this sheet

,

(Dont change) Squad,

,"As indicated in the tab name, this view show the assignment of employees to squads."

,"The view is generated fromt the data in CMA, so please don't change any values"

(Copy to Overview)  Squads,

,Use this tab to COPY UNLINKED to other documents like Consumer Mega Alliance - Overview

Don't show in Squad view,

,"Set this checkbox to true if the person should not appear in the squad overview views. An example is if someone is on garden leave, then they would still appear in the list, but are not technically working in the squad anymore."

Values ...,

,Value Tabs are holding the values for dropdowns in CMA.

,"Adding or changing values impact those dropdowns and the validation, "

,"If a value has to change, e.g. a new squad or change of name, then change it here, and not on the dropdown fields in CMA"

Pivot,

Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Beatrice Dimarucut set up a meeting with Maria Chelminska, Prateek Jajoo, someone in Bread Sheeran (Canada - Toronto HQ, 2), someone in Bread Sheeran (Canada - Toronto HQ, 2), Nikita Gorshkov, and Alison Ryan to review and align on next year's plans across various teams. Maria Chelminska and Prateek Jajoo outlined TBT 2026's strategy, which includes a growth stream focused on expanding the SKU portfolio, revamping the signup page as a quick win, and a strategic launch of a "pantry fresh" product, alongside a retention stream focused on fully digital feeding guides, dashboard improvements, tailored cancellation deflection, and a plan recommendation engine. Someone in Bread Sheeran (Canada - Toronto HQ, 2) and someone in Bread Sheeran (Canada - Toronto HQ, 2) detailed Factor's Q1 roadmap, constrained by the Shopify experiment outcome and new product development complexities, focusing on OTP launch iterations, new product development (mealshake and creatine) despite SKU flexibility issues, and integrating with the Factor app, while Beatrice Dimarucut presented Good Chop's H1 roadmap, prioritizing the OTP launch, a price value experiment to improve conversion/retention, and foundational work to clean up legacy code in the funnel. The participants also discussed integrating third-party tools like Beam for charity donations, Yachtpool for product ratings, and Incom for HelloFresh gift card partnerships.

Notes Length: Standard

* Schedule and Meeting Logistics Beatrice Dimarucut set up the meeting to review and align on plans for the next year, aiming to identify overlaps and opportunities to combine courses for development and discovery. Maria Chelminska mentioned that their team's plan is fairly complete for the year, though changes are likely, with Q1 being closer to concrete (00:01:14). The discussion also briefly touched upon workplace conditions, as Maria Chelminska and Prateek Jajoo were meeting in a different building because the heating was broken in the main HelloFresh building in Berlin, which had been a long-term issue (00:00:00).

* TBT 2026 Strategy and Streams Maria Chelminska confirmed that for 2026, the team will operate in two streams: a growth stream and a retention stream. These streams might have separate backlogs, and Maria Chelminska and Prateek Jajoo may focus more on one stream each (00:01:14). The growth stream will follow a setup with a main priority—a larger, strategically important initiative—and quick wins, which are smaller, sprint releases intended to motivate the team and maintain pace (00:02:39).

* Growth Stream Initiatives (Q1) The growth stream will start the year by expanding the SKU portfolio, adding new calorie options for very small and very big dogs. A key initiative is the signup page revamp. Maria Chelminska stated that the current signup page, which uses a shared layout, has not been updated since its launch, and the goal is to improve it as a quick win to increase the intent to proceed by removing messages about add-ons that currently appear to be an upsell (00:02:39).

* Strategic Priority: Pantry Fresh Product Launch A high-priority strategic project is expanding the product offering with a new product type called pantry fresh, which is a fresh product that does not require refrigeration. To prepare for this, the team is redesigning the existing p

set up uh the integration. I'll keep you folks posted. is fairly straightforward in terms of how it's redeemed. And then we use cash credits that drop onto the HelloFresh accounts uh that the user can redeem in their next box. That's pretty much the the system there. So, if if somebody uh does pick this up, um I I think in at some point once it's live, uh I can see how Yuri and Lauron will get to this topic.

Nikita Gorshkov: We can probably just reuse the whole system wholesale.

Maria Chelminska: But a credit for sorry a gift card for HelloFresh can be also used for only used for HelloFresh.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yes.

Alison Ryan: Those

Nikita Gorshkov: But uh just imagine like you probably saw these same as the Xbox cards, the Amazon cards that you see in stores.

Beatrice Dimarucut: physical.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Mhm.

Nikita Gorshkov: Physical have a fresh group.

Maria Chelminska: Yeah, I was maybe just thinking that it's going to be like a mult multibrand card and we can also benefit from

Beatrice Dimarucut: Nice.

Alison Ryan: are the dreams. Maria in

Nikita Gorshkov: All right, folks.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Nice.

Nikita Gorshkov: Thank you so much for organizing this.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah, I think at least we know more or less what everyone's doing. Hopefully it was useful. Um, yeah. Nice. And Nikita, do you have five minutes to say maybe Allison?

Nikita Gorshkov: Sure.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Okay, cool.

Nikita Gorshkov: Right.

Beatrice Dimarucut: All right. Thank you. Bye. Um, so we were gonna on Thursday like I was planning on sharing with like the the squad like the road map for next year and obviously like also would be good for them to get contacts on Shopify, but

Nikita Gorshkov: H I doubt it

Beatrice Dimarucut: I don't know how to like frame this without freaking people out that it might be a possibility that the web experience gets replaced.

Nikita Gorshkov: honestly that it will be that big of a risk uh right now. I think the way we can frame this and the way we should be framing it is for what it is. It's a way for us to much more rapidly experiment with the offer that we can provide to various customers and it's more

💡 Meeting Notes [To be filled after the Review Meeting by the YP Document Owner and sent out via email to attendees. This section does not impact the maximum number of pages]

Review Meeting Date: Oct 16, 2025

Attendees: Ed Boyes Assaf Ronen Dominik Richter Holger Hammel,Cho HwangAnnie MeininghausDina MehrezThomas GrieselFabien SimonMarlene RosnerBrian LeungAdriana VillarEvan WeintraubJama Musse





Key Takeaways, Decisions, and Next Steps:

1. Clarify how menu expansion plans, personalization roll outs  and app features come together: 

   * Elysium (new store and homepage in the app) roll out is fast followed by new app feature which benefits users  irrespective of menu ranking roll out (most notably merchandising widgets for marketing,  recommendation widgets,bringing search to apps, populating “most popular, “trending” widgets - details)

   * Menu ranking roll out: At the same time there is a roll out plan for menu ranking models which prioritizes P500 readiness in Q4/Q1 as well as Penguin for Factor US. Food Systems is trying to expedite Penguin for INTL if possible, prioritized after p500. Fall back is to launch Penguin Harp personalization to INTL markets expanding in Q1.  Other RTE markets in H2.

2. Share prioritization framework  for Project 5M. The prioritization is heavily influenced by successful companies and features observed (direct or indirect competitors) as well as through an internal workshop. This revealed a consistent and significant behavioral gap: Users enthusiastically save recipes (often from social media) but rarely act on them. This indicates a high desire for inspiration but a significant friction point in execution. This led to the prioritization of the recipe bridge in Q4/Q1. If requested we can  walk through the detailed methodology.

3. Decouple forecasting from personalization models. Food Systems to define technical interfaces enabling independent iteration. Once validated, assess org impact in Q1–Q2.

4. Reconcile marketing RAF plan with tech YP.  We have addressed the  gap between Marketing and Consumer growth targets. Share squad will focus on strengthening the Refer-a-Friend (RAF) program while building new in-product sharing loops to drive organic growth. prioritizing foundational fixes — improving data visibility, customer experience, and operational agility — to make the RAF program self-sufficient and easier to optimize without tech dependencies. 

5. Variable pricing is an urgently requested feature by markets. We added it  to the Market Innovation squad backlog H2. Will define long-term ownership before initiation as we are currently moving pricing ownership to growth MA. 





Changes requested to the Yearly Plan during Draft Reviews. Please update before submission for final YP approval:  

* Should we invest into an AOV-focused squad? Yes we will self fund a new AOV driven squad in Q2 with a dedicated KPI. Focus in Q1  is first to roll out the new personalized core journey including widgets and then layer in more upselling components. 

* Loyalty strategy across markets: We decided to reserve a small team to  maintain and improve the existing  program while implementing  the new vendor based loyalty program to launch first in  the US . See Loyalty Strategy SMT Shareout.

* Double check if all Factor requirements are in the plan: All documents were collected and integrated into the Market Innovation backlog. To be signed off by Ed Boyes
