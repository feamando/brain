[HOW TO READ] This document is structured based on three big parts:

1. Summary & High-Level Overview Tab: These tabs serve as the central strategic hub. It outlines context and brief customer flows for each major use case (e.g., Good Chop, Seasonal Boxes) to give a quick understanding of the customer journey. It also synthesizes the Key Functionalities that need to be built across all these different use cases.

2. Individual Use Case Tabs (e.g., "Experience - Good Chop", "Experience - Seasonal Boxes"): Each of these dedicated tabs dives deep into a specific product or initiative. They break down the requirements by Milestones (e.g., MVP - Milestone 1), providing a clear roadmap from a use case perspective. The requirements are listed with User Stories and Acceptance Criteria format.

3. Dependency Tab: These tabs are used to identify and detail any specific work or information required from dependent Tribes and alliances.

1. Summary View of the Solution Proposed

This initiative aims to deliver a One-Time-Purchase (OTP) capability experience across HelloFresh Group brands. As of June 2025, across HelloFresh, several use cases had been identified—such as event-themed seasonal boxes, curated selections of specialized items (e.g., premium meat and seafood from Good Chop), items from a broader marketplace of third-party CPG brands, or ready-to-eat meals from sister brands like Factor—as standalone purchases, without the necessity of an active weekly meal kit subscription for that particular transaction (though OTP may also complement existing subscriptions).

The solution involves creating a seamless OTP user flow within each participating brand's digital platform. This includes clear product discovery for OTP-eligible items, transparent pricing and benefits, distinct OTP cart[a] and checkout processes, appropriate order management for both new and existing customers (subscribed, paused, or cancelled), and downstream capabilities such as delivery management and data.

This foundational OTP capability will initially be piloted and rolled out for:

1. 2025 Initiative Rollouts: 

   1. Seasonal Boxes across HelloFresh (similar to the ANZ model but integrated).

   2. Good Chop offerings for both prospects and actives.

   3. Factor Form item based OTP purchase

2. 2026 Potential Targets:

   1. A 2-Way Marketplace on a selected HelloFresh brand (e.g., Green Chef US pilot) (potential PoC in Q4 2025) 

   2. Cross-selling of Factor meals (as OTP) (iteration on the “Opt-in” Market Integration Model)

   3. Further discovery might include Factor B2B using the new functionality.

2. Problems Being Solved

Limited purchasing flexibility of current HFG services discourages prospects looking to explore a new service for themselves and their household (OTP orders in funnel, trial boxes) or for past customers looking for greater flexibility without the subscription commitment (reactivation, one-time box offers). Further opportunities to capture new use cases in exploring non-box-add-on marketplace opportunities (Dropship expansion) as well as offering gift boxes (bundles, care packages) easily. 

Today, brands are resorting to either third-party tools (e.g. Shopify) or internal legacy systems (Evangelist), to enable these functionalities and consolidating them through OTP services would significantly lower costs and operational complexity. This OTP functionality is designed to cater to a variety of customer needs and scenarios across HFG brands, complementing existing subscription models. It is, including:

* Seasonal Boxes: Enabling customers to purchase from special seasonal box offers on HelloFresh (eg. AU/NZ Christmas Box); on top of their existing subscription easily through the core HF experience. Past solutions have poor customer experience and technical challenges (being built through abusing existing subscription architecture). 

* Product Trial: Allowing new customers to experience a brand's quality and service (e.g., Good Chop, Factor meals) before committing to a recurring plan. 

* One-off/ Unplanned Needs: Enabling existing or past subscribers to make additional purchases outside their subscription cycle for special occasions, to stock up, to try specific items without altering their core subscription, or to supplement their meal kits with ready-to-eat options or other grocery staples.

* Expanded Assortment & Discovery: Providing access to a wider range of products, including those from third-party vendors via a 2-way marketplace (e.g., snacks, pantry items, specialty goods) and cross-sold items from other HelloFresh Group brands (e.g., Factor meals).

* Gifting: Providing an easy mechanism for customers to purchase products (bundled items, care packages, etc.) as gifts for others.

3. Business Value of Solving This Problem (Combined OTP)[b]

OTP unlocks customers not wanting subscriptions, for trial, gifts, or special occasions. Good Chop OTP experiments in Funnel estimate a potential €2.7M-€3M in TCVA Seasonal box OTP is estimated at €16.5M-€21.5M net revenue potential. The 2-Way Marketplace PoC (limited scope) projects ~$2.5M-$4.3M TCVA. The overall OTP opportunity is projected at €24.7M-€28.8M in incremental TCVA.[c][d][e]

This capability allows existing subscribers to add OTP items, Factor meals, or marketplace products to their regular orders or make additional purchases, boosting overall spend and engagement. Factor cross-sell alone projects an AOV increase of 0.8-1.2pp and potential AOR increase of ~5%. 

4. High Level Solution Breakdown (Here for more detail)

* Core Purchase & Checkout Experience (P0 - Must Have): Enabling customers to easily select one-time purchase (OTP) products, understand their full cost upfront, and complete their orders.

* Operational & Backend Integration (P0 - Must Have): Ensure that customers' OTP orders are processed efficiently behind the scenes, from inventory management to delivery.

* Enhanced Flexibility for OTP (P1 - High Priority): Offering greater convenience and more flexible options, such as guest checkout, basic customization, and the ability to manage their OTP orders.

* Marketplace & Cross-Sell Specifics (P1 - High Priority): Providing customers with access to a wider variety of products, including those from third-party vendors (marketplace) and sister brands like Factor, for one-time purchase.

* Advanced Customization for OTP (P2 - Medium Priority): Giving more control to both customers and internal teams, such as enabling customized boxes, real-time updates on product availability and marketing tools to create unique OTP offerings.

* Future Enhancements (P3 & P4 - Low Priority): Enhance post purchase experience, including easy reorder and combining OTP orders with existing subscriptions.

2. MVP Functionalities for One-Time Purchase (OTP) Capabilities Across HelloFresh Group Brands:[h][i]

Based on the detailed user stories and acceptance criteria for Good Chop, Seasonal Boxes and VMS; here are the key functionalities the technical team needs to build:

1. SKU Management:

   * Explanation: The system needs to allow for the creation and management of distinct OTP products (SKUs) that can have different sizes, prices.

2. Menu Configuration:

   * Explanation: The system needs the ability to differentiate menus (e.g., specific cuts for Good Chop, pre-set menu for seasonal box, no individual recipe purchases for seasonal boxes).

3. Account Creation & Login:

   * Explanation: The system needs to handle various user states – new customers requiring registration, existing non-subscribed customers logging in, and active/paused subscribers using existing credentials – to facilitate a smooth flow into the OTP purchase journey. 

4. Distinct OTP Checkout Process:

   * Explanation: A dedicated checkout flow for OTP orders is required to ensure clarity on one-time costs for prospects, actives and cancelled. This includes displaying transparent, itemized final pricing (box, shipping, discounts, taxes) and supporting all existing payment methods. 

5. Delivery & Address Management:

   * Explanation: The system must support configurable delivery dates and windows specific to OTP orders[j], which may differ from subscription cut-off times. It needs to handle new address inputs, pre-fill addresses for existing customers, and perform zip code validation for delivery eligibility. 

6. Automated Order Confirmation & Tracking:

   * Explanation: The platform needs to automatically send comprehensive order confirmation emails with full OTP order details, pricing, and delivery information. It must also provide subsequent notifications with tracking information once items ship, and enable logged-in users to view OTP order status and history. [k][l]

7. Customer Care & Internal Order Management (BOB & OWL Integration):

   * Explanation: Customer care agents require access to OTP order details through their backend system (BOB) to perform various actions like order cancellation, delivery rescheduling, address changes, and voucher adjustments. There should also be accessible FAQ content for OTP orders. 

8. Backend Operational & Financial Data Integration:

   * Explanation: All OTP order data must be accurately captured, categorized, and integrated into backend systems (e.g., Katana) for inventory management, fulfillment differentiation (e.g., identifying OTP orders to avoid attaching subscription freebies), logistics, and financial reporting, ensuring proper revenue recognition. 

9. Data & Analytics Capabilities:

   * Explanation: Frontend and backend data for OTP orders need to be correctly captured and categorized on data tables, and then included in major Tableau dashboards with identifiable filters, to enable insights and performance monitoring. 

10. CRM (list of events):

   * Explanation: CRM are able to read OTP orders and send transactional emails such as order confirmation and delivery tracking.

11. Subscription Conversion Flow:

   * Explanation: For Good Chop, the system should facilitate a seamless process for OTP users to convert to a subscription, allowing a subscription order to be created alongside the OTP order without impacting it, and potentially applying specific conversion benefits.

12. [Decided not for MVP] Benefit Application:

   * Explanation: The platform must support discounts for OTP products versus subscriptions. This involves the capability to auto-apply vouchers based on entry points or allow manual entry, with benefits configurable for single box discounts or free shipping, ensuring no interference with existing subscription benefits.

13. [Decided not for MVP] Multiple Order Capability:

[m]

   * Explanation: The system needs to support multiple orders at the same time, whether that’s a combination of OTP and Subscription order, or multiple OTP orders.

   * For VMS only : Customers can checkout a combination of OTP and subscription product at one go 

3. Customer Experiences for OTP MVP requirements[n][o][p][q]

	Ability for internal operations, logistics, and finance teams to process and manage OTP orders

	This capability is inferred by the successful execution of the customer journey steps. As a customer, I experience the result of these internal teams' work: my order is correctly fulfilled, shipped, and charged accurately. The product arrives as expected, and any issues I have can be resolved by customer care because internal systems accurately reflect my order.

	Ability to convert OTP users to a subscription

	* I might also be presented with an opportunity to easily convert my one-time purchase into a subscription, potentially with additional discounts, using my existing address and payment details. 

* This new subscription order would be separate and wouldn't affect my current one-time delivery.

	Launched

	OTP for HF Formers (US) (MVP Test)

	Launched and Currently Running. Targets US canceled customers via the web flow (mobile web and desktop). This experience is pure e-commerce, requiring manual menu selection before checkout at a premium, non-discounted price.

	Launched Oct 14th. The entry point showed strong user interest with a 11%+ clickthrough rate. Of these, 30% interact with the meal choice features, and 10% complete a purchase. There is a 30% drop-off between order submission and successful payment, highlighting an opportunity to streamline the payment process. We are investigating the causes. So far, we see no incremental impact on users with at least one order or on net revenue. (full result)

	Occasional Boxes (ANZ)

	Launched in Australia (AU) and New Zealand (NZ): Leverages the new OTP backend architecture to offer occasional boxes (e.g., Christmas boxes). These are configured as pre-set menus where recipes cannot be customized.

	Launched Oct 30th. On track to hit the 5k order target by the end of month, with relatively high conversion rate (~15%). (Dashboard)

	Cross-Selling (HF Active → Factor)

	Launched (HelloFresh active customers purchasing Factor ready-to-eat meals) as an experiment; still running. This is viewed as an “OTP use case for active users”.

	Traction is observed with 700 initial conversions, 10.5% of the converted cohort placing additional recurring x-sell orders and 23% of exposed customers ordering both meal kits and RTE in a given week as of W44. The experiment is still running and numbers will continue to update.



Note: This functionality does not leverage the core OTP technology built for formers but it’s a similar experience for customers. 

	Upcoming CRM Test (HF Formers)

	Planning Follow-up Test (Target: Early November): Using pure CRM campaigns to route canceled users directly to the OTP flow, bypassing the standard reactivation page.

	Launched on Thu, 13th November. The goal is to gather directional demand reads and engagement from low-intent/inactive users via a lean test without disrupting the standard reactivation flow.

	Occasional Boxes (CA)

	Launching Holiday Boxes in Canada, with similar setup to the Christmas Box launch in Australia and New Zealand.

	Launched on Fri 14th November. Gathering early results.

	Planned in Q4 2025

	OTP for HF Formers (UK[ac]) (New Launch)

	MVP Test Launching/Imminent. The UK market is a high priority due to competitive urgency against Gusto, which generates approximately 10% of its volume from one-time purchases. The UK team is "very keen" to run this test. This test leverages the same flow/infrastructure as the US MVP.

	Planned for W50

	Factor Form

	Launching One Time Purchase option for Factor Form to expand total addressable market (TAM) and capture customers who prefer transactional purchases over recurring subscriptions.

	Planned for W51

	Good Chop

	Good Chop has previously explored One-Time Purchase (OTP) experiments showing significant short-term conversion lifts despite lower long-term retention. The new Good Chop experience aims to expand market share by integrating on-demand purchasing as a core offering. 

	Planned for W51

	Q4 2025 Constraint: There are no plans for HelloFresh OTP pre-defined boxes for active users in Q4. Current efforts focus on addressing foundational technical dependencies.

2. Where We Want to Be: The Grand Vision and Plan to Scale OTP

The long-term vision is to transition to an enhanced single-tier model anchored by flexibility, expanding our offerings to all customer states.

A. Redefining Customer Engagement

We are working toward blurring the distinction between "active" and "canceled" status, viewing customers as simply "ordering in a given week" or "not ordering in a given week". This recognizes that OTP purchases and subscriptions should be considered at the same level in the future.

B. Scaling Audience and Use Cases (The Plan to Scale OTP)

The One-Time Purchase initiative is structured around three key strategic use cases designed to maximize customer lifetime value and expand market reach:

1. Integrate OTP into Core HelloFresh Journeys: Establish OTP as a core, complementary offering alongside the subscription box. This pillar focuses on making the flexible purchase option available across all customer states: Prospects, Actives, and Former customers.

2. Unlock New Consumption Occasions: Expand the OTP platform to support non-subscription purchase opportunities. This includes high-value, complementary use cases like Occasion-Based Boxes (e.g., holiday or seasonal boxes), VIP/Gifting Orders, and Donation Boxes.

3. Expand Across the Brand Portfolio: Leverage the foundational OTP architecture to enable transactional purchasing for other HelloFresh brands. The initial focus will be on Factor Form and Good Chop as the MVPs, with plans to extend the capability to other brands like Chefs Plate and Youfoodz in 2026.

Currently working with the Global Strategy team and Growth team to finalize use cases and markets.

Audience

	Target Experience (Use Cases)

	Timing (Target)

	Q1 2026

	Canceled Customers (Formers)

	Intent Based Routing: launch a new home page for cancelled users across mobile AND native app to replace the Reactivation page as the current start flow for formers

	Q1’2026

	Prospects (New Customers)[ad]

	Guest Ordering/Trial Box: OTP as an alternate low-commitment activation path. This flow, similar to Good Chop's "graduation flow," will nudge users to subscribe after their first box.

	Early 2026 (Q1)[ae]

	HF DACH & FR (All Customers)

	Launch Easter occasional box. With a similar setup to the Christmas Box in AU/NZ. These occasion based boxes can be bought by all customer types.

3. What’s Missing & Critical Blockers

A. Key Features and Technical Infrastructure Gaps

Scaling OTP globally and enabling rich feature sets depends on solving critical technical and data infrastructure gaps.

Prio

	Missing Capability

	Impact & Context

	When Will We Work On It

	Dependencies

	P0

	Marketing Data & Attribution (CAC/CVA)

	CRITICAL GAP: The core marketing attribution asset (MAC) is built on plan_id. When users convert via OTP, we lose attribution data, preventing accurate tracking of CVA, CC, and CAC.

	Immediate Focus (Q4 2025): Identified as needing immediate attention. Acceleration requires support from the marketing tech team.

	Platform/ Marketing Tech

	P0

	CRM Communications (Non-Subscription Emails)

	We lack proper, non-subscription-language transactional email templates (order confirmation, payment confirmation). Sending existing templates risks confusing OTP buyers.

	Immediate Focus (Q4 2025): A decision split is being implemented by Paul Larcara to prevent sending confusing subscription emails to OTP customers. A new dedicated template will be developed.

	CRM

	P0

	Logistics/SCM Infrastructure Scalability

	Global scalability is blocked because local logistics systems (like Demeter in the UK) require dedicated updates to recognize the new "order grouping ID" instead of the legacy subscription ID for fulfillment.

	Ongoing (Market by Market): US implementation is complete. UK integration requires dedicated local team effort. Global scaling requires building the functionality into Odin (the global order enrichment system).

	SCM

	P1

	Supporting Add-ons & Surcharges

	The initial solution lacks support for ordering surcharge recipes or add-ons. This limits menu diversification and key use cases (e.g., celebrity boxes).

	A follow-up release to fix this gap is scheduled for the end of November.

	Consumer Core

	P1

	Cart Consolidation

	Currently OTP is not using the global cart service, this creates some issues and non-standardized processes downstream. 

	Proposed to be Q1 Focus

	Shopping Foundations

	P0

	CDP Integration

	A new customer status is required for customers who make one-time purchases. This status will exist alongside the current classifications of "Prospects," "Actives," and "Formers," which are based on subscription status.

	Proposed to be Q1 Focus

	Consumer Data

	P1

	Benefits

	Vouchers can only be applied when a plan_id or subscription_id is linked. The Benefits team needs to enable voucher application at the order level.

	Proposed to be Q1 Focus

	Customer Benefits

	P2

	Forecasting

	Integrate One-Time Purchase orders into the existing forecasting data model. This integration will directly influence box order forecasting and purchasing decisions across all markets.

	Discuss on mitigation plan for Q1, and tackle within Q2

	SCM Analytics

	P2

	Morpheus

	One-Time Purchase data is currently not included in Morpheus, which may affect Morpheus's accuracy rate.

	Discuss on mitigation plan for Q1, and tackle within Q2

	Global AI

	



B. Marketing & Collaboration Strategy (Scaling Initiatives)

Collaboration with marketing and CRM is critical for scaling OTP, ensuring that the technology enables sophisticated targeting and conversion pathways.

Marketing/CRM Initiative

	Goal & Context

	Timeline (Target)

	Dedicated/Smart CRM Campaigns (Query 1)

	Launch dedicated campaigns that route low-intent/inactive formers directly to the OTP flow, bypassing the subscription-focused reactivation.... This test assesses engagement from segments hard to convert to subscription. Long-term vision includes campaigns that land users directly on either the subscription or OTP path

plan

	First MVP Test:

Nov 10th, 2026

	Fixing Marketing Data Attribution

	CRITICAL: Fix the core marketing attribution asset , currently built on plan_id, which causes us to lose attribution data (CAC/CVA) when users convert via OTP.... This capability needs prioritization from the marketing tech team.

	TBD

	Cross-Conversion Triggers

	Implement triggers to upsell OTP customers to a subscription, and vice-versa (e.g., subscription customers can be offered OTP if they show intent to cancel... The long-term plan is to build new pathways to upsell OTP in the product.

	TBD

	General Communication Strategy 

	Develop distinct CRM emails (transactional and marketing) to treat OTP customers differently, avoiding confusing subscription language. Post-purchase emails for OTP users should focus on order confirmation and building excitement for future menus, rather than explicitly pushing re-subscription.

	TBD

	Enabling Discount/Promo Support

	Integrate technical support for vouchers, benefits, and discounts for OTP orders to enable targeted marketing efforts (e.g., offering discounted OTPs, similar to Gousto's occasional use)....

	TBD

🥩 Experience: Good Chop

[HOW TO READ] This document is structured based on three big parts:

1. Summary & High-Level Overview Tab: These tabs serve as the central strategic hub. It outlines context and brief customer flows for each major use case (e.g., Good Chop, Seasonal Boxes) to give a quick understanding of the customer journey. It also synthesizes the Key Functionalities that need to be built across all these different use cases.

2. Individual Use Case Tabs (e.g., "Experience - Good Chop", "Experience - Seasonal Boxes"): Each of these dedicated tabs dives deep into a specific product or initiative. They break down the requirements by Milestones (e.g., MVP - Milestone 1), providing a clear roadmap from a use case perspective. The requirements are listed with User Stories and Acceptance Criteria format.

3. Dependency Tab: These tabs are used to identify and detail any specific work or information required from dependent Tribes and alliances.

Good[ag] Chop One Time Purchase

Good Chop has previously explored One-Time Purchase (OTP) options to address customer feedback about subscription hesitation and to improve reactivation rates, with past experiments showing significant short-term conversion lifts despite lower long-term retention compared to traditional subscriptions. Recognizing that many customers are skeptical of commitments and seek greater flexibility and control, the new Good Chop experience aims to expand market share by integrating on-demand purchasing as a core offering. 

Good Chop OTP Milestones:

* [MVP - Milestone 1] [ETA W51’ 25] One-off boxes for prospects customers. Good Chop would be offering prospects who do not want a commitment upfront, one time purchase options with value differentiation (with less to no discounts).

   1. Ability to discover and browse OTP products as a prospect on Good Chop pre-checkout funnel

   2. Ability to complete checkout for OTP orders on Good Chop pre-checkout funnel

   3. Ability to receive order confirmation and track delivery

   4. Ability for customer care to support OTP orders

   5. Ability for internal operations, logistics, and finance teams to process and manage OTP orders

   6. Ability to convert OTP users to a subscription





* [Milestone 2] [ETA Q4’ 25] One-off boxes for active customers. Good Chop would be encouraging orders from Actives who might want an additional box outside of their regular cadence (e.g. last minute bbq box for a specific weekend)

[MVP - Milestone 1] Requirements for One-off boxes for prospects customers

Note: MVP for prospects is not using the new OTP end point yet. It’ll be used on subsequent milestones for better scoping

User Stories

	Acceptance Criteria

	Design/ Notes (Figma)

	Technical Notes

	1. Ability to discover and browse OTP products as a prospect

	1.a. OTP option on Plans Page

As a prospect customer, I want to compare the one time purchase vs subscription options, so that I can decide the most suitable option for me. 

	* Customer can choose the same box size (M, L, XL) and then toggle between

   * Subscription option (with cadences)

   * One time purchase (OTP) option

* If customer choose the OTP option, then

   * The price of the boxes changes to the OTP prices[ah]

   * [Note] On CCM, the OTP options are setup with different SKU, hence toggle to the OTP SKUs when they choose this





















	  



	There will be multiple variants to the experiment in Statsig

* Each variant has its set of OTP SKU to differentiate the base box price

* All variants have the same box size options (M, L, XL)





For example:

* Variant A

   * MR-OTP-6-A: $149

   * MR-OTP-12-A: $269

   * MR-OTP-18-A: $399

* Variant B

   * MR- OTP-6-B: $119

   * MR-OTP-12-B: $229

   * MR-OTP-18-B: $359





Do not need to return cadence for new OTP end point[ai][aj]

	1.b. Exclude Voucher Application

As a prospect customer, I understand if I cannot get the voucher benefits if I am choosing OTP, so that I can make comparisons and informed decisions

	* IF has an active voucher attached AND customer choose the OTP option on Plans (req 1.a.), then detached the benefit of the vouchers which includes

   * Not applying the price discounts to the main OTP box price

   * Not offering the free add-on items

   * The benefit banner will also disappears

* However, if they toggle back to the Subscription option, the voucher benefits re-apply without any additional action from the customers





* Components:

   * "$50 off in your first delivery" --> Dynamic value based on voucher attached. Remove when no voucher

   * "Save up to $500 per year" --> Hard coded value for all boxes, but hide when no voucher attached

   * "Free cut on every delivery" --> Hide when no free cut voucher attached

   * Other components are static





	Investigate in CUI if we can exclude OTP SKU (part of different product family)





	1.d. Select Cuts (Recipe) Menu

As a prospect customer, I want to select specific cuts and see any free or surcharge items based on my chosen OTP box size, so that I can customize my order and understand the full contents and potential extra costs before checkout.

	* The Select cuts experience are the same with subscription WITHOUT all the benefits applied

   * Free add-on component

   * Discount on Order Summary

   * Hide Benefit banner

	



	Menu can be differentiated between OTP vs subscription

* OTP menu setup on CCM related to OTP SKUs

* Hide Surcharge items is visible and can be added to cart (setup through CCM)

	2. Ability to complete checkout for OTP orders on Good Chop pre-checkout funnel

	2.a. Account Creation

As a prospect customer, I want to be able to create an account or log in with an existing account (without a subscription) after selecting my cuts, so that I can proceed with my one-time purchase.

	* Main function of account pages is the same for OTP

   * [Status quo] Customer proceeds to /signup after choosing cuts

   * [Status quo] Customer creates account with eligible email

   * [Status quo] Customer with an account (without subscription) can login without creating a new account

* Remove information related to benefits

   * Hide Benefit banner (below header)

   * Hide Free add-on banner (below sign up fields)

   * Discount on Order Summary

	Hide this banner:

  



	



	2.b. OTP Pricing on Order Summary

As a prospect customer, I want to see a clear and itemized summary of my OTP order on the checkout page, including box price, shipping, applied discounts, and all taxes, so that I understand the final cost before payment.

	* /checkout pages, Order summary displays 

   * Box pricing for OTP box based on the one chosen on /plans (req 1.a.)

   * Shipping price

   * Remove discount and benefit applied

* Shipping price is the same with subscription order, but can be configured manually

	



	



	2.c. Delivery Options

As a prospect customer, I want to easily input my address and phone number, and see available delivery dates and times specifically for my OTP order, so that I can ensure my delivery is scheduled conveniently.

	* Main function of account pages is the same for OTP

   * [Status quo] Customer needs to input address details and phone number

   * [Status quo] Customer is defaulted to a delivery time after filling in the address → Look at technical notes for Delivery Options

* Change copy on (refer to figma for source of truth)

   * Copy on “Delivery Day” component

* Remove information related to benefits

   * Free add-on banner (below header)

   * Discount & FFL on Order Summary

   * Hide the Voucher Input field

	  



	Delivery Options for OTP are the same for Subscription, however

* Since customers do not choose cadence on Plans, default them to the 4WEEK option[ak]

* This is relevant on the graduation flow req 4.a





Do not need to return cadence for new OTP end point[al][am]

	2.d. Payment & Checkout

As a prospect customer, I want to see all available payment methods and clearly see that my order is a one-time purchase that will only be charged once, so that I can complete my transaction confidently.

	* Main function of checkout pages is the same for OTP

   * [Status quo] All payment methods are available for OTP orders

   * [Status quo] Customer needs to input eligible payment details

* Remove/ change payment information related to Subscription

   * Change the Subscription T&C

   * Remove the Checkbox 

* Remove information related to benefits

   * Free add-on banner (below header)

   * Discount & FFL on Order Summary

   * Hide the Voucher Input field

* Handle cart de-duplication (thread)[an][ao]. 

   * Whenever a customer clicks on “Place order”, we should not always create a new cart ID - we should always send just a single cart ID per session. Even if a customer updates their cuts, we should patch the same cart ID so that we only send one cart ID to the new OTP endpoint. 

	Hide this:

  



Change copy and remove checkbox

  



	Use the new OTP end point





Note: To handle deduplication, aside from the FE change to send a single cart ID, Puneet Joshiwill implement that if COS receives the same cart ID while it is still processing, it wouldn't create 2 separate orders. Thread

	2.e. Payment Loading State[ap]

As a prospect OTP customer, I want to understand if my payment is still being processed, so I can wait and know for sure that my order is placed.

	* If customer fill up the payment correctly and click on “Place Order”

   * Processing Order State → Show this state when waiting for the payment to be processed and orders to be created on the backend

   * Processing Order State → Show this state after the order creation and payment charging is successful 

      * Bring customers to Order confirmation page within x seconds

   * Error state → Show this state if the payment OR order creation is unsuccessful

      * Bring customers back to payment page with error message

	Refer to figma for latest design

  



	



	3. Ability to receive order confirmation and track delivery

	3.a. Order Confirmation Page

As an OTP customer, I want to see a clear order confirmation page after my OTP purchase, displaying all correct pricing, selected cuts, delivery date, and confirmation that it's a one-time delivery, so that I have immediate assurance of my order details.

	After a successful OTP order checkout

* Customer redirects to /subscription-loading pages, Order confirmation page displays 

   * Correct prices box price, shipping price, (if any) discount and benefit applied, (if any) taxes and fees (eg, GST)

   * Correct cut selection information

   * Correct delivery date information

* Hide the “Pre cut-off change box” information

* Additional information that this is an OTP order and will only be delivered once

	Hide ticker information:

  



	Images might not work?[aq][ar]





In order to show selected cuts, BE change needs to happen to fetch public menu instead of my-deliveries menu which needs sub_id (thread). Ticket to be done by X-Flex: XSELL-419: [Post Checkout] [Order Summary] Modify fetch menu function in reactivations bff

	3.b. Order Confirmation email

As an OTP customer, I want to receive a detailed order confirmation email for my OTP purchase, including correct pricing, cut selections, delivery date, and explicit mention of it being a one-time delivery, so that I have a record of my order.

	After a successful OTP order checkout

* Customer receives an Order Confirmation email (list here) from CRM with:

   * Correct prices box price, shipping price, (if any) discount and benefit applied, (if any) taxes and fees (eg, GST)

   * Correct cut selection information

   * Correct delivery date information

* Additional information that this is an OTP order and will only be delivered once

	



	Order confirmation event is available in SF as expected, CRM manager needs to:

* Create a separate email template for OTP SKUs to differentiate the content

	3.c. Dashboard Order Management

As an OTP customer, I understand that I cannot directly edit, reschedule, or cancel my OTP order from my dashboard, so that I know to contact customer care if I need assistance with my order.

	* The OTP dashboard is newly created only for OTP orders

   * Customers can see multiple OTP orders

   * The latest OTP order will be expanded, the rest are hidden under a chevron

   * Customers can see the Order details and order summary

   * Customers can click “view order” to open the order summary modal (similar to subscription)

	Refer to figma for latest design

  



	The OTP dashboard is newly created page under Whitelabel repo – (/my-deliveries/otp) url TBD





In order to show selected cuts, BE change needs to happen to fetch public menu instead of my-deliveries menu which needs sub_id (thread). Ticket to be done by X-Flex: XSELL-419: [Post Checkout] [Order Summary] Modify fetch menu function in reactivations bff

	3.d. Tracking

As an OTP customer, I want to access my delivery tracking number from my dashboard or an order tracking email once my OTP order has shipped, so that I can monitor its delivery status.

	Once the order is being shipped from the warehouse, customers can access the delivery tracking number from:

* CTA from OTP Dashboard

   * Clicking on the CTA opens the Delivery tracking in a new tab

* Order tracking email from CRM (list here)

	1. To check: will tracking work out of the box or we need to change something? Thread



2. Note to CRM for OTP Order Confirmation email:

→ inform customers that they will get a separate delivery tracking email / link on the website

	3.e. Order States

As an OTP customer, I want to understand if my order is still on delivery or already delivered, so that I can decide what to do next.

	The order statuses for OTP are similar to subscription orders

   * Pre cut-off: No pre cut-off state for OTP because after checkout the order is directly on post cut-off state

   * Post cut-off: This is the default state after order created, the title of the box will say “Arriving on xx date” 

   * On Delivery: Once delivery is triggered, the “Track delivery” CTA will be visible

   * Finished/ Delivered: The OTP completed orders are still shown on the page with “Delivered on xx date” as the order title

   * Note: This state also applies for cancelled box

	



	3.f. OTP Dashboard Entry Points[as]

As an OTP customer, I want to access the OTP dashboard, so that I can check my ongoing or past OTP orders.





	There is no redirection logic to bring customers to the OTP Dashboard page. (In status quo, subscription customers are always redirected to dashboard after login)





To access the OTP Dashboard, customers can find the entry points from multiple places. These pages will check if the logged in customers has an ongoing OTP order

   * [P0] Customers with no subscription

   * /Plans

   * /checkout

   * [P1] Customers with Active OR Inactive subscription

   * /my-deliveries (Active state) [P1]

   * /settings/plan/reactivate (Formers state, Reactivation page) [P1]

   * /my-deliveries (Formers state) [P2 - since CTA leads to /reactivate anyway]





When customer click on entry point then:

   * Open a new tab

   * The new tab opens the OTP Dashboard

	Refer to figma for latest design

  



	



	4. Ability to convert OTP users to a subscription

	4.a.[at] Offer for converting to a Subscription

As a customer converting to a subscription, I want to receive clear additional discounts or benefits for my new subscription orders, so that I am incentivized to continue with the service.[au]

	   * On the OTP Dashboard, customers with OTP orders will see a “Subscription Graduation” section:

   * Show discounts on their next subscription benefits

   * Show Free add-on on their next subscription benefits (if applicable)

   * CTA: if clicked, will bring them to the “Graduation page” which is our current reactivation page with some tweaks

   * The “Graduation Section” disappears if customers have a subscription attached to their account (either Active or Inactive)[av]

	  



	Subscription voucher is created in advance and hard coded based on statsig experiment variant[aw], for example:

   * Code ABC → variant A = $50 + Bacon

   * Code 123 → variant B = $30 + Wings

   * Code XYZ → variant C = $20 + Ribeyes

Confirm we don’t need to experiment, just hardcode 1 voucher





Voucher code details [TBD]

	4.b. Subscription Graduation Page (Plans Page)

As a customer, I want to easily create a subscription order using my existing OTP address and payment details, so that I can seamlessly transition to a recurring service after trying a one-time purchase.

	   * Customer is redirected to /plans with the OTP variation as default

   * Customer can purchase another OTP order, OR a new subscription

   * Customer goes to /plans with a predefined “graduation” voucher

	



	Note: customers is redirected to /plans

	4.c Successful Graduation to Subscription





As a customer that subscribes, I want to know if I have successfully subscribed with all the benefits that are offered, so that I can be sure and manage my next Good Chop box.

	After successful “graduation” to subscription, the normal subscription experience is triggered.

   * Customers got order confirmation email

   * Customers redirected to /my-deliveries to see their subscription order

	



	



	4.d. Entry point to Subscription dashboard[ax]

As an OTP customer with a subscription (active or inactive), I want to go back to my subscription dashboard, so that I can manage my subscription, not just my OTP orders.





	   * IF OTP customer has a subscription_id, then remove the graduation component (req 4.a) and show entry point to subscription dashboard.

   * Customer will be redirected to /my-deliveries – applicable for both active or inactive subscription





	



	



	5. Ability for customer care to support OTP orders

	4.a. Customer Care Access

As a customer, I want to easily reach Good Chop Customer Care and find relevant FAQ content, so that I can get support for my OTP order.

	   * Customer can reach out to Good Chop Customer care and be routed to appropriate support based issues

   * Available FAQ content around OTP orders

	



	



	4.a. OTP Order Management in BOB & OWL (migration to OWL by EOY)

As a Customer Care agent, I want to access and manage OTP orders in BOB, so that I can effectively assist customers with their OTP order inquiries.

	   * Customer Care agents can access OTP orders through BOB

   * Make changes to OTP orders from BOB

   * Order cancellation and Refund

   * Delivery Rescheduling

   * Edit cuts/ recipe selections

	



	



	6. Ability for internal operations, logistics, marketing and finance teams to process and manage OTP orders

	5.a. Internal Operations & Logistics

As a warehouse team member, I want one-time purchase orders to be clearly identifiable, so that I know not to attach freebies or other subscription-specific items to them.

🎁 Experience: HF Seasonal Boxes

Hello Fresh Seasonal Boxes

HelloFresh Group's seasonal box offerings, traditionally sold as one-off purchases through separate microsites and unconnected operational flows, have historically faced significant challenges including declining sales, a poor user experience requiring customers to re-enter details and preventing seamless order tracking, and substantial operational overhead due to disconnected systems. Recognizing the significant market opportunity for festive and occasion-based offerings, the new One-Time-Purchase (OTP) initiative aims to overcome these limitations by integrating seasonal boxes directly into the core HelloFresh experience.

System allows a user (guest or via a streamlined account creation) to browse OTP-eligible products, view detailed product information, add to cart, and complete a one-off purchase. A clear distinction must be maintained between OTP and subscription pathways.





[Checkout]

System allows logged-in users with paused subscriptions to access an OTP purchasing section/flow, select items, and checkout without triggering full subscription reactivation. Order confirmation and delivery are specific to this OTP order.





[Checkout]

System allows active subscribers to place an OTP order as a distinct transaction. The OTP order should have its own delivery scheduling options (if different from the regular subscription) and payment process. It should not interfere with their regular subscription unless an explicit choice is made by the user to combine or replace (future feature).

[Delivery dates, cutoffs, etc]





[Order Confirmation[cq] & Tracking[cr]]

System sends an automated order confirmation email with full OTP order details (itemizing separately shipped items if applicable) and estimated delivery window(s). Subsequent notification(s) provide tracking information once item(s) ship. Logged-in users can view OTP order status and history.

(Mention that the email(s) are specific to the flow. Extract “Delivery Tracking” as a separate requirement?)





[Conversion to Subscription][cs][ct]

System allows a subscription order to be created alongside the OTP order. The subscription order will have its own cut-off, delivery date, menu and invoice. It should not impact the current OTP order,

3. Priorities for User Stories

Priorities are assigned above within the user story table (P0 - P4).

   * P0 - Must Have: Core functionalities essential for launching a basic, viable, and legally compliant OTP service across all initial use cases. Includes fundamental purchase flows, clear pricing, order fulfillment integration (including basic drop-ship and cross-brand logic), and handling of different customer states.

   * P1 - High Priority: Features that significantly enhance the customer experience, operational viability, or initial commercial success. Includes guest checkout, basic customization/gifting, self-service order management, and core functionality for marketplace discovery and Factor OTP purchase.

   * P2 - Medium Priority: Important features for expanding customization, improving discoverability, providing better marketing/merchandising tools, and enabling core vendor/cross-brand operational capabilities.

   * P3 - Low Priority: Valuable additions for customer convenience, repeat OTP business, enhanced gifting, and more robust marketplace/cross-sell support.

   * P4 - Nice to Have: Complex features offering incremental benefits but are not critical for the core OTP value proposition and require significant cross-functional effort.

[a]@nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com Using existing cart?

[b]A secondary value of OTP is that the pricing (likely more expensive than subscription) creates an anchor effect, making the subscription look more attractive.





So even if OTP itself doesn't have a high uptake rate, we've seen it push subscription uptake as well.

[e]hey folks, the BCs are in the respective WBDs linked above.

- How is the compensation work for Seasonal boxes?

- How is the reporting process?

[g]@stephen@hellofresh.com @jr.payopanin@helloconnect.org

[h]Hi @nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com not all these requirements are actually in the scope of MVP. Items like:

- Benefits Application

- Multiple Order Capability

- Subscription Conversion Flow





Can you please update this to avoid confusion? 





cc: @nikita.gorshkov@hellofresh.com

_Assigned to nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com_

[i]Updated, the Subscription conversion we're still discussing if its possible to just handle from the front end with current end point that we have.

[j]is the intention to still utilise the LC for OTP also?

[k]@nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com This would then be tracking in existing subscription account?

_Assigned to nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com_

[l]Yes, but we're not planning this for Seasonal Boxes since we don't want to touch the HF main flow

[m]@nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com Check on loyalty

[n]Can we also discuss the actual upload of the boxes to the site - will this be covered by Digital ops teams locally and will this be integrated into CCM or will this require a different tool?

[o]The plan is to handle the all through CCM (separate SKU created). Unless you think there are things CCM cannot satisfy? @elyse.hill@hellofresh.co.nz

[p]That's perfect, the team would prefer a single system to minimise work load so CCM is the ideal. Assuming MPS will also be updated to create these menu items or will CCM be enabled to load these addon's manually?

[q]@nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com just wanted to flag that the local editorial team has raised that with XPS we are currently unable to export the Christmas Recipes for the photo studio briefing as they are one time recipes so we will need to add a workaround of getting MP to upload the Christmas offering into MPS in a future week > Editorial will export the data for a brief > MP will need to delete the recipes from MPS again. For OTP can we add this as a feature to solve the manual workaround for the teams? 

(cc: @sally.nolan@hellofresh.com.au )

[r]Is this a BAU capability or is this new for OTP in VMS?

[s]@nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com 





not high prio but i think we should also cover how OTP <> loyalty would behave in the future. Should it count towards box count and loyalty programs?





My initial thought is yes

_Assigned to nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com_

[t]do we expect user interaction here (reentering voucher for subscription)? let's specify.

[u]@wellney.yarra@hellofresh.com help check, these are based on my assumptions

[v]isn't this rather a byproduct of current limitations?





in a future scenario where stakeholders can define different values for the same voucher depending on sub/OTP, would we still want customers to enter more than one voucher for the same purchase?

[w]I'm thinking 1 voucher per order, so if customer has 1 OTP and 1 subs, which means they can apply two vouchers

[x]if the customer checks out with OTP and sub in the same flow, same address, then the expected behavior would be one delivery fee only.





we're not consolidating it today because shipping fee is contained within SKU price. I don't think we should continue this, though. In a world where we have multiple SKUs per sub (WIP), then shipping fee should belong to the order, not the SKU

[y]oops never mind, just saw the P1 requirement to address this below

[z]- OTP charged real time after checkout

- Subscription charged later after cut off

[aa]Needs to be handled by the brand

[ab]Separate invoice if charged separately

[ac]IE is keen on following UK footsteps here afaik! I believe as soon as we have some (positive) results from the UK test.

e.g. which channels will we sell them?

how will we market it vs. current subscription strategy? 

what will be the pricing?

what will be the benefit strategy?

[ah]This indicates a difference in pricing between the 2 options- is the assumption that the subscription price is lower?

is this clear enough as an AC for the de-duplication part?

_Assigned to himash.tehan@hellofresh.com_

[ao]Yes it's clear enough.





I think there's also a case if a customer decides to switch the plan type entirely in the same session. This would also need a patch to the same cartID.

[as]@himash.tehan@hellofresh.com @bdim@hellofresh.com to create the tickets after design is finalized

[at]@himash.tehan@hellofresh.com @bdim@hellofresh.com to revisit claudia's ticket

[au]In this scenario will the customer be considered new or reactivation in the system?

[av]just noting that in the future if there's an inactive account, the CTA should actually be more about Reactivating





if subscription is still active, then entrypoint should simply be to view existing plan from the OTP dashboard





I don't think this needs to be a blocker for release though

[aw]Keep in mind that after we launch the experiment, we can't change the voucher codes and their configurations

[ax]@marina.guthmann@hellofresh.com @bdim@hellofresh.com to be added later, not P0 for MVP

[ay]Hi @nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com just to confirm will regionality be a feature within OTP? The option to have region specific boxes (i.e. Perth/SA require fumigation which makes some SKUs unavailable to use in our boxes so we would need to set up a Perth regional box with different SKUs just for customers with postcodes specific to that area.) ?

[ba]Thanks! (FYI @tiffany.zhu@hellofresh.com.au )

[bb]@nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com just double checking if this will support add-ons like 'cheese box'?

_Assigned to nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com_

[bc]If "add-on" is creating another box (SKU) with an additional Cheese menu, then yes.





The system cannot support the add-on definition that we're used to in HF, meaning the item based pricing on top of the box itself.

[bd]@nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com 

Does this mean a non-HF user has to sign up for a subscription (at least short term) in order to get the one-off? i.e. he'd have to actively pause the subscription, if he doenst want the normal box, while being a one-off customer?

_Assigned to nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com_

[be]Hi Theresa, apologies for the late reply. The user need to have an account but not an active subscription. This is similar to how first time customers needs to fill in their email first

[bf]This can be done via CCM

[bg]Also, a question if we can remove it from the MVP.

@nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com

[bh]@nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com would you be in a position to confirm this means that OTP orders will flow through standard HF tools? (SPS-CPS-MPS, D4 forecasting, Inventory Planner, OPE, cut-off handled by Odin/ Katana to mention a few?)

[bm]Hey @michelle.mapleston@hellofresh.com.au What kind of visibility do you need from the SCM/ Katana team? We have some technical documents but not sure if that's helpful. For a start, I can add you to our main channel and you can post your questions there? Or else we can find time to sync

[bn]Should be an option to either opt to integrate or not integrate OTP orders into weekly supply chain. ie rather than sending separate label files and delivery manifest, we may want fulfilment ops to integrate within existing process. Route both OTP and regular deliveries at the same time, and produce together





This will not always be the case such as XMB which may want to be produced separately from regular orders, but other scenarios may exist where we want to produce with regular orders

[bo]Are these timelines concrete for XMB ANZ? We start selling in October so are currently still scoping Shopify for selling this year to ensure we hit this deadline. Keen to hear with what confidence we can plan on having this proposed solution in time?

[bp]@elyse.hill@hellofresh.co.nz we'll be discussing with the larger tech group next week to know the possibility of this timeline. I promise @tamas.szilagyi@hellofresh.com.au to have this clarity by W1 July. Does that work?

[bq]That sounds great thanks, @nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com!

[br]check to tech for a "seasonal box' site or separate site for different occasions

[bs]how will you model add-ons?

[bt]Something to check with Tamas tomorrow, if this is a blocker, then Oct might not be a suitable timeline

[bu]@tamas.szilagyi@hellofresh.com.au modeling options and add-ons through different SKUs

[bv]@tamas.szilagyi@hellofresh.com.au we also need to consider modularity options as per XMB 2025 set up and in line with the flexibility our main competitors offer (i.e. My Food Bag)

[bw]This sounds like a regular "subscription + one-time addon" experience. Why would we want OTP for that?

[bx]Better customer experience. VMS experience is more e-commerce like. There are 3 main products (greens, hydration, protein) that come in different formats and flavors. As a customer I expect to be able to choose what I want to try once vs. subscribe to. I want to find all my products in the same place instead of having to understand what is a subscription vs one time purchase vs add-on. I also want to be able to convert my OTP into a subscription later (yes we can do this with subscribable add-on too, but why make it more complex for the customer and introduce another flow?)





From an internal POV we should also not add extra complexity for other teams to onboard another SKU, create add-on menus, call another menu, etc. if we don't have to.

[by]What about the other way around? Are we expecting an ability to use existing benefits (through loyalty program) for the seasonal boxes?

[bz]What does it actually mean? Can you drop an example?

[ca]wondering the same - @nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com what did you have in mind?

[cb]@mabu@hellofresh.com lmk if this is clearer now @nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com

[cc]What's "GST charge"?

[cd]Goods and Service Fee - NZ is set at 15% and is normally baked into products sold and AU is 10% but there are different rules to consider in order to remain compliant.

[ce]Assuming this would be a separate payment for customers who may also be ordering a regular subscription box? Similarly to how we charge HFM currently?

[cf]Payment details are never stored in the HF system, hence, it is not possible to prefill payment details. What we can try doing is "use existing payment" which would be a reference to a payment token.

[cg]What do we mean by this?

[ch]@nathaniel.deo@hellofresh.com i assume you mean all the payment methods?

[ci]Does it mean that the data of OTP should be a part of analytics and should be identifiable as OTP?

[cj]essential to note that customers who have already purchased a seasonal box to be excluded from future CRM emails (i.e. if someone bought a Christmas box at full price, should not get a Black Friday discount email)

[ck]check if this breaks given there are not recipes essentially.

[cl]How will errors and NPS be measured?

[cm]check for Taxes

[cn]ask Daniel

[co]Check with Benefits if they need subscription ID

[cp]@mabu@hellofresh.com

[cq]Check on Invoice

[cr]@mabu@hellofresh.com to check

[cs]Check if account, delivery and payment information can be prefilled

[ct]Ask Leo

[cu]I think we can simplify this to just talk about Katana

[cv]Split between FE data and BE data

[cw]@mabu@hellofresh.com to help check

[cx]Forecasting? Or will we rely on business case assumptions to plan volumes. Concern here is waste and ordering accuracy.

[cy]Will we have individual landing pages per seasonal offering or a page for "gifting" and a page for "seasonal boxes" which has all current boxes. (ref point https://www.myfoodbag.co.nz/shop/)

[cz]what's the difference between a guest checkout and a normal checkout?

[da]what's the difference between a guest checkout and a normal checkout?

Problem Statement

Social media has become a primary hub for culinary inspiration, where people turn to influencers to discover new recipes. While Followers struggle to find the necessary ingredients and an easy way to re-cook them, Influencers look for new revenue streams to be more independent from the heavily controlled platforms and find new ways to expand their reach and engage with their audiences authentically and organically via food.





Opportunity:

Hellofresh sees a huge opportunity to serve both: by transforming influencers' inspiration (recipe) into a shoppable, cookable meal kit for the consumers. 

By bridging the gap as the Expert in operation, warehouses and logistics, we provide customers a way to enjoy these recipes easily and the influencer to serve their followers and create a new revenue stream. The social commerce market is growing rapidly and can represent a huge opportunity for us to attract new customers.





Why now:

We see the urgency to act now, because influencers are already trying to solve this problem with links to ingredient orders  via Instacart or Pinterest partners with Instacart to enable 1-click grocery list generation from saved pins. But today, shoppable content on social media within the food category is often limited to individual food items as opposed to a holistic offering where the ingredients for entire recipes and direct delivery can be purchased. 





The Core Ask 

WBD: Influencer Marketplace

Explore desired and viable vision for a curated recipe creator marketplace (1. influencer, 2. Aggregators) with the option of an  instant purchase as a meal kit ‘fulfilled by HelloFresh’.





Long-term Vision (Later) 

Transform HelloFresh into the “Spotify for food”  a platform where any creator can share a recipe that HelloFresh fulfills.

👏 Initiatives in other teams

Other teams





There are current parallel initiatives in other teams that could inform us on our research and mvp development.





Marketing Team: HF Canada

* Background: They’ve been trying to use static recipe slots to allow marketing to better storytell about specific recipes - and thereby drive acquisition. The iteration of this idea is the marketing campaign with influencers. Given the upcoming Influencer Marketplace test for Canada, they thought this would be worth trying as an MVP, to understand how it works and what we can learn before the larger infrastructure is completed.

* What: Marketing campaign for 2026, a view Influencers will feature pre-developed recipes on the HelloFresh menu to drive traffic to our sign up page in Canada. Expect we'll start with testing 1 or 2 influencers.

* Who: Cole Banning James Griesser

* How it could interleave: 

It’s similar to our idea but not the same, since they won't have a storefront. We can collect data for inform our business plan.

   * Call with Cole and Nikita, 10.11.2025

   * Projects run separately since they are different from technical execution

   * We will inform each other on progress and reach out to influencer

   * Bryan Altman was responsible for North America, now he is responsible for US only, so Cole does North America





Project DAU

   * What: Cookbook Lib on the Hellofresh Platform for actives and prospects

   * Team: Lisa TruebloodMatin Lashkari Lexy Martin Luigi Frettoloso 

   * How it could interleave: 

Nikita/ Shrishti Oct 24, 2025 : The feature Lisa and her team are working on allows saving an influencer/creator’s recipe from social media on the app. When a creator’s recipe is saved X number of times, we can potentially reach out to them. They’re also building a tool that automatically converts a creator’s recipe into the HelloFresh recipe format. I think this code could be reused — for example, an influencer could input their recipe, and it would be converted into the HF format directly.









AI Matching Feature



      * What: AI matching algorithm that helps local culinary teams identify which recipes they’re missing compared to other markets, and which SKUs are locally procurable.

      * Team: Imran Uddin (Food System)

      * How it could interleave: 

 Nikita/ Shrishti Oct 24, 2025

Imran’s team is developing an AI matching algorithm that helps local culinary teams identify which recipes they’re missing compared to other markets, and which SKUs are locally procurable. I’ll be collaborating with them, and I see potential to reuse parts of this code as well (though not entirely sure yet).









SEO /GEO

         * What: On the SEO side, we’ve already built a system (I’m adding the links) for recipe development pages.

         * Team:  ???

         * How it could interleave: 

Nikita/ Shrishti Oct 24, 2025

On the SEO side, we’ve already built a system (I’m adding the links) for recipe development pages. I see an opportunity to create a similar setup for influencers — either a dedicated influencer section or individual influencer pages that could attract organic traffic. Additionally, we could feature influencers directly on recipe pages. That way, if someone searches for “Recipe X + Influencer Name,” our pages could surface in search results.

                  * Influencers recruitment:

Meeting with Sameer (MVP Squad) // Dec 2th 2025, 30 mins





Authors: Annette MvdE, Katheryn Eckles, Sameer Doda

Last updated: Dec 2, 2025

Gemini Transcript: Influencer Marketplace Catchup - 2025/12/02 11:57 EST - Notes by Gemini





The discussion primarily focuses on the strategy and immediate next steps for the Influencer Marketplace MVP (Minimum Viable Product), with an emphasis on product development flow, technical implementation, and influencer management/research.





1. MVP Strategy & Product Development Flow

Point

	Owner/Follow-up

	Summary

	Decision/Action

	Stakeholder Communication Strategy

	Sameer 

(Action: Create initial starting point for discussion)

	Previous approaches of showing high-fidelity screens early led stakeholders to focus on visuals (e.g., "this button looks ugly") instead of the core customer journey/promise.

	Decision: 

                                          * Future discussions will focus on customer journey alignment first. 

                                          * Low/high-fidelity screens will only be shown after the customer journey is agreed upon and backed by research.

	MVP Focus

	Sameer 

(Action: Define MVP scope for the platform)

	Determine the scope of the MVP to ensure a focused effort and quick build.

	Decision: 

                                          * The MVP will be consumer-facing and managed (HelloFresh creates everything for the influencers). Scaling the supply side (open platform) will happen after proving the business case with consumers.

	Product Requirements Document (PRD)

	Annette

Sameer needs input and help from Annette/team

	Need to formalize requirements to start building.

	The PRD will be generated once the customer journey is aligned and all decisions are backed by existing research, including rationale 



(“So and you know why we are taking some decisions, what is the rationale behind it and which is where you know I need a lot of input and help. So we do that and that would give us our product requirements document for us to start building on it.”)

	Existing "Cookbook" Tool Integration

	Sameer/Annette (Investigate feasibility)

	The DAU team has built a tool that converts video URLs into HelloFresh recipe cards (ingredients/steps).

	Decision/Action: 

                                          * Explore using the same code/tool for the Influencer Marketplace MVP to significantly reduce manual effort for recipe creation from influencer videos.

	











2. Technical Implementation & Platform

Point

	Summary

	Decision/Action

	Rationale/Context

	Platform Choice (Internal vs. Shopify)

	Discussed whether to build the consumer-facing store (similar to the Christmas Box) on Shopify or internally.

	Decision: Lean on building internally using existing HelloFresh components/platform.

	Shopify setup is complex. Internal build allows for a small, defined MVP scope and reuse of existing Christmas Box code.

	Christmas Box Platform Limitations

	The existing Christmas Box store (built by Sameer) has back-end limitations: only one box per order flow, complex recipe configuration, no add-on purchases, and no voucher capability.

	Action/Context: The team (Do and others) are already working to solve these limitations in Q1. If solved, the front-end can be reused and quickly tweaked for the Influencer Marketplace.

	Familiarity with the existing front-end (created by Sameer/Vander) makes quick adjustments possible.

	Creator-Side Tools (Future Scalability)

	Discussed tools needed for an unmanaged, scalable marketplace (post-MVP).

	Tools needed include: Automated recipe card creation from video, Costing mechanism exposure for influencers to understand product cost, and Analytics/Trends dashboards (like Shopify) for content inspiration and performance tracking.

	This is important for the long-term vision to move from a managed to an unmanaged, true two-way marketplace.

	







3. Influencer Management & Research Concerns





Point

	Summary

	Decision/Action

	Context/Learning

	Ingredient & Fulfillment Limitations

	Concern about whether HelloFresh can fulfill the unique/non-standard ingredients influencers use (e.g., specific spices, products).

	Action: Sameer needs to speak with the physical product team to understand their capability to create or source new ingredients/spice mixes.

	Influencers are highly concerned about the quality and specific ingredients matching their videos.

	Influencer Recipe Adaptation

	Will influencers be willing to change their recipes/videos to fit HelloFresh's standard assortment?

	Finding (from Research): Influencers are more likely to create specific new dishes for the marketplace, based on what they know HelloFresh can fulfill or what consumers are searching for (using analytics/trends data).

	This avoids having to recut existing video content to match ingredient swaps. They want to see the assortment early in onboarding.

	Marketing and Legal

	Need to outreach to specific influencers, and legal needs to create contracts for the MVP phase.

	Action: Sameer will sync with the local HelloFresh Canada marketing team (and potentially Col Banning) to drive the influencer recruitment and contract process.

	A nice platform is useless if no influencers are there ("if nobody's there, it's a problem").

	Research Handover & Next Steps

	Discussed the transfer of knowledge from the current research team (Annette/Katy) to the product team (Sameer).

	Decision: Sameer wants the team to continue working together (even with occasional conversations) because key learnings and context are often missed in formal documentation.

	The team is concentrating on the creator view as it is completely new territory compared to the standard transactional consumer view.

1. Creators: Where B2B exploration stands (5 min)

                                                                              * 5 interviews completed 🙌  for first signals with creators (mix of hobby cooks and chefs, reach: 34k–1.2M)

                                                                              * We are finding relatively consistent insights from the influencers we have spoken with so far with the current script being focused on expectations and mindset around the program. 

                                                                              * All summaries here



                                                                                 * New key learnings 👀  since last review, talked to cookbook author and chef (1.2 M)

                                                                                 * Cookbook recipes: She sees no conflict in listing recipes from her cookbook. She views it as "good exposure" and believes being on multiple platforms is beneficial.

                                                                                 * Compensation expectation: expected a % of profit from the recipe sales

                                                                                 * Desired from HF:

                                                                                 * Data on traffic (Purchases coming from her social media link vs. platform)

Building and maintaining consumer trust, which is driven by authenticity, relatability, and professionalism rather than just expertise is important. While influencers are valued for their real-life relatability, barriers such as recipe inaccuracy, sponsorship skepticism, and fear of social commerce scams can inhibit engagement and purchase.

                                                                                             * Gap:

                                                                                                   * Trust, Vetting & Accountability: Define what signals credibility for both creators and the platform, including user expectations for "quality control," how they assign blame when errors occur, and what verification actually means to them.

📅 Sprint 2 (Nov 10 – 21)

Sprint 2





What do we believe, and what do we most need to learn first?





Nov 10, 2025– Nov 21, 2025









1. Alignment with GCI

Nov 10, 2025 with  Joanna Lindenberg





Risks

                                                                                                                           * damage to the brand if we offer recipes that have not been tested/ vetted (Q: do Influencers want that?)

                                                                                                                           * Operations need to be flawless for all kind of recipes (if we can not provide the right amount of an ingredient, the right type, we lose credibility)

                                                                                                                           * They have created this doc, summarizing their concerns https://docs.google.com/document/d/17QQPGfsqq8ZUbvqNEJh3ur4Xm0rEEi6tzV5pOaJnuMc/edit?tab=t.0





2. Alignment Marketing NA

Nov 10, 2025 with Cole Banning and Nikita Gorshkov





                                                                                                                           * Cole Banning is now responsible for Marketing in NA, former Bryan Altman (now US)

                                                                                                                           * Influencer Campaign will be the least risky version of our project: vetted recipe will be shared with followers and lead to the signup page of HF subscription

                                                                                                                           * We agreed:

                                                                                                                           * Projects run separately since they are different from technical execution

                                                                                                                           * We will inform each other on progress and reach out to influencer

                                                                                                                                 * Significant struggle with managing platform algorithms (TikTok/Instagram) and keeping up with constant trends

	Platform Design & Usability: The new platform must be designed to avoid being a "time suck" to maximize influencer engagement, as time is a major constraint.

	



	II. Demand for Data and Analytics

                                                                                                                                 * Strong desire for more visibility into search term data ("creator search insights"), top-selling recipes, conversion rates, and quality feedback (scores/ratings).

	Feature Development: The platform needs to provide robust data and analytics tools to help creators adapt their recipes and content.

	III. Monetization Model Hesitancy

                                                                                                                                 * Influencers are comfortable with flat-fee brand partnerships and fear the necessary work for a commission-based model to be worthwhile.

                                                                                                                                 * Creators expect an entry/posting fee followed by commission, fitting the model into their current business.

	Business Development & Education: Future interviews and marketing materials must reframe the value proposition away from the existing flat-fee brand deal paradigm.

                                                                                                                                 * Strategies include creating a two-pager comparing the two models, emphasizing passive income from evergreen recipes, and using MVP data to show earning potential.

                                                                                                                                 * Consider offering a flexible compensation model (initial flat rate, later switch to commission) and providing detailed sales forecasting data.

	IV. Value Proposition and Customer Perception

                                                                                                                                 * Mixed feelings on whether the meal kit provides a sufficient advantage over a standard grocery trip. Initial skepticism on cost and delivery cadence.

                                                                                                                                 * Positive view of the benefit for audiences, especially for difficult-to-source or expensive ingredients.









	Marketing and Reframing: 

                                                                                                                                 * Clearly market the cost savings and value compared to standard grocery shopping to address customer affordability concerns and perceived wastefulness.

                                                                                                                                 * Focus the promotion narrative on the recipe/dish being fulfilled, rather than a general brand partnership.

	V. Recipe Quality and Vetting

                                                                                                                                 * Influencers expect HelloFresh to vet recipes (internal developers test them for quality and taste) due to concerns about varied quality in a marketplace setting.

	Quality Control (QC) & Trust Building: 

                                                                                                                                 * HelloFresh must take responsibility for recipe quality to protect the brand.

                                                                                                                                 * If full vetting is not possible, a highly visible and searchable review and rating system (e.g., filter by 4/5 stars) is essential for customers to "self-select into quality."

	VI. Targeting and Creator Profile

                                                                                                                                 * Current interviewees may be content creators first ("smoking mirrors") and not "recipe people." Recruitment of cookbook authors has been difficult.

	Recruitment Strategy: 

                                                                                                                                 * Target "food people," especially cookbook authors, who are more likely to have makeable, high-quality, and evergreen recipes.

                                                                                                                                 * Leverage cookbook publishers for author access and interviews. Highlight the platform's value as proof of engagement for future brand deals ("X customers bought my recipes").

	VII. Brand Ecosystem and Engagement

                                                                                                                                 * Creators expect the meal kit to be an extension of their brand (logo, links).

                                                                                                                                 * Desire for clarity on the timing from recipe submission to fulfillment to time promotions effectively.

	Platform Functionality: 

                                                                                                                                 * Enable features that support the influencer's brand and community engagement.

                                                                                                                                 * Support the concept of "live cookalongs" or episodic events, where the meal kit enables mass participation, boosting community and live engagement.

	VIII. Trend-Chasing vs. True Creation

                                                                                                                                 * Smaller influencers tend to be more trend-related, while all feel pressure to participate in trending recipes (e.g., "Dubai chocolate").

	Product Strategy: 

                                                                                                                                 * While expecting trends, the platform must allow for diverse content and focus on evergreen recipes.

                                                                                                                                 * Marc suggested a clearer definition of a "trend" is needed (ingredient vs. recipe type) for actionable insights.

	IX. Recipe Aggregation & Monetization Scale

                                                                                                                                 * The goal is for customers to order recipes, menus, or meal plans from various creators and HelloFresh (aggregation).

	Long-Term Vision: 

                                                                                                                                 * Position the platform as a storefront or reverse marketplace with massive potential.

                                                                                                                                 * Emphasize the global growth and reach opportunity for influencers, as the company's fulfillment capacity is "next level."

	Annette MvdE

	X. Ingredient Quality and Cost Control

                                                                                                                                 * Influencers want detailed info on ingredient quality, stock availability, and brand names to ensure consistency between their video and the delivered box.

	Process and Cost Education:

                                                                                                                                 *  Educate creators on logistical and cost constraints.

                                                                                                                                 * For initial big players, consider allowing kitchen visits to build trust. Educate creators on how to limit expensive ingredients to maintain a competitive meal cost and take rate.

	Biggest challenges are the algorithm, time & effort

                                                                                                                                          * The algorithm is a major challenge, constantly changing across platforms, making it difficult to stay visible. 

                                                                                                                                          * Even when users follow someone, they may go weeks without seeing their content. Keeping up with platform-specific trends, trending audios, and frequent algorithm updates adds to the complexity.

                                                                                                                                          * Editing and adapting videos to meet the unique requirements of each platform is demanding and time-consuming, especially when managing multiple channels.

                                                                                                                                          * Another key pain point is the ongoing need to generate fresh ideas and stay on top of emerging

	The platform needs to be seamless and low effort for influencer, including



                                                                                                                                          * Minimizing manual effort, users want the ability to import recipes directly from the creator’s website into the HelloFresh portal, eliminating the need to retype content.

	Seek Data & Analytics to learn and adapt

Creators lack visibility into what content or recipes resonate most with users. While not always stated directly, their struggle to identify trends and understand audience interest suggests a need for clearer, data-driven guidance. 

Access to metrics like top-selling recipes, conversion rates, and quality feedback would help them make more informed decisions about what to create next.

	                                                                                                                                          * Develop a creator-facing analytics dashboard that highlights trending content, best-performing recipes, and user engagement insights, similar to TikTok’s Creator Search Insights. This would give creators the data they need to stay aligned with user demand, optimize their content strategy, and reduce guesswork.

	Mixed feelings on value proposition

                                                                                                                                          * Across interviews, creators expressed mixed feelings about the value proposition, particularly around cost, delivery cadence, and whether meal kits offer enough advantage over a standard grocery trip.

                                                                                                                                          * However, a consistent sentiment emerged: they believe the service would deliver strong value to their audiences, especially when it includes hard-to-source or expensive ingredients (e.g., pistachio paste for the viral Dubai chocolate trend). This suggests creators see clear audience benefits even if they personally weigh the trade-offs.

	                                                                                                                                          *  Emphasize and communicate the unique value delivered to audiences, such as access to specialty ingredients, convenience, and the ability to recreate trends easily.

                                                                                                                                          * How often do creators believe their audiences actually want specialty or trend-driven recipes versus more accessible, everyday options?





                                                                                                                                          * How important is it for them to independently create these meal kits in a new platform (and manage this additional platform ) vs. working with us in a brand partnership?

	  



	Cohesive brand ecosystem

There is an expectation to treat the creator's meal kit as a special, easy-to-use extension of their brand. 



To keep followers engaged, the kit must feel authentic. 

                                                                                                                                          * include the creator’s logo

                                                                                                                                          * Experience back to digital space: e.g. QR code for an exclusive tip video or back to their content

                                                                                                                                          * Value seen in integrated "Live" Cook-Alongs with synchronized delivery

                                                                                                                                          * Operations: talking to Melanie Schwind, there are possibilities to re-brand e.g. the Mealcard or using a neutral box instead

	  



	Ingredients are key: Quality, selection and transparency

                                                                                                                                          * The system must be completely honest with creators and customers (ingredient substitutions and quality). If the kit has to use a slightly different kind of cheese than the one in the video, the creator must be able to tell the customer upfront to keep their trust. (quality is critical, especially for recipes with few ingredients.)





Vetting recipes

                                                                                                                                          * Most creators' first expectation was that we would vet the recipes for quality control (ingredients are available). 

                                                                                                                                          * If the expectation is that the creators vet their own recipes, one mentioned that different creators may have different quality standards (i.e. testing a recipe 5 times vs. making it once before posting).

                                                                                                                                          * Suggested a "test run" and access to research on what customers are buying.

	Questions to Operations:

                                                                                                                                          * We need to make sure to offer alternatives of ingredients with transparent information of brand quality (Gap: what are the specific metrics they are looking for?)

	Fair Revenue Model

                                                                                                                                          * Most creators expect a revenue model that includes both a promotional fee and a commission on each sale, viewing this as a fair exchange for their effort. 

                                                                                                                                          * However, not all creators share this view: one preferred a flat-rate payment similar to traditional brand deals, expressing uncertainty about sales volume and concern that generating meaningful revenue would require substantial posting. This reveals a spectrum of comfort levels with performance-based compensation and highlights the need to address creators’ confidence in the product’s sell-through potential.

Customer side

                                                                                                                                          * Program must be priced reasonably and accessible for "everyday" use and suggesting additional financial incentives (50% off, free dessert) to convince users to buy

	                                                                                                                                          * Offer flexible compensation models to meet different creator preferences, such as a hybrid structure (flat fee + commission) or a strictly flat-rate option. 

                                                                                                                                          * Additionally, provide clear sales forecasting, audience fit insights, or promotional support to help creators feel more confident that their efforts will translate into meaningful sales without excessive posting pressure.

	Value-Prop

There is a significant "Inspiration-Execution-Gap" in consumer cooking behavior, particularly among the Efficient Inspired segment, who frequently seek meal inspiration online, especially from social media food influencers (primarily on YouTube and Instagram) but often save rather than successfully execute the recipes.

	Gap:

                                                                                                                                          * Purchase behaviour: what are the occasions to purchase such a meal kit? How often? Does it matter what kind of recipe? How is the relationship towards the influencer influencing this?

                                                                                                                                          * Influencer shop vs. Marketplace: would you buy it from the same creator? Would you be interested in others as well?

                                                                                                                                          * Viability: What would you be willing to pay for this?

	Needs/Barriers

Success in an Influencer Marketplace hinges on building and maintaining consumer trust, which is driven by authenticity, relatability, and professionalism rather than just expertise. 

While influencers are valued for their real-life relatability, barriers such as recipe inaccuracy, sponsorship skepticism, and fear of social commerce scams can inhibit engagement and purchase.

                                                                                                                                          * High skepticism toward sponsored content (-> authenticity) 

                                                                                                                                          * E.g. On Reddit, people frequently raise doubts about how genuine recipe creators are, particularly when brand sponsorships are involved.

                                                                                                                                          * Fear of recipe failure  (-> robust vetting)

                                                                                                                                          * Some creators are perceived as lacking "professionalism," admitting to only testing recipes once or twice. Many users distrust recipes from TikTok/Instagram until they are "vetted by other sources first." 

                                                                                                                                          * Concerns about transaction trust (> transparent logistics) in social commerce





	To address these challenges, the strategy should focus on:

                                                                                                                                          * Implementing robust quality control and vetting of recipes, including repeat testing, standardized instructions, and transparency.

                                                                                                                                          * Incorporate social proof (reviews, ratings, friends’ activity) to reinforce trust and immediacy

                                                                                                                                          * Promote interactive content, like polls or quizzes, that naturally lead users to relevant products.



                                                                                                                                             * Delivering “edutainment” content that combines entertainment with practical guidance and skill-building.



Gap: Test live-stream shopping events or shoppable stories to combine entertainment and purchase.

	Seamless purchase

The key appeal of social commerce lies in ease, convenience, and low-friction purchasing, allowing consumers to move seamlessly from product discovery to checkout. 





Platforms that reduce navigation and integrate in-app purchasing are driving higher engagement and conversion, as users value immediate access and personalized buying options.

Key insights:

                                                                                                                                                * Low-effort purchasing drives adoption: 28–32% of social media shoppers transact because it’s easy, familiar, and enables instant purchase upon discovery.



                                                                                                                                                * Seamless in-app payment accelerates conversion: Nearly 30% of users complete purchases via stored payment methods or credit cards without leaving the app, emphasizing the importance of integrated checkout.



                                                                                                                                                * Platform-specific mechanisms matter: TikTok and Meta offer strong in-app shopping experiences, while YouTube and Pinterest require redirection or third-party integration, impacting conversion potential.

                                                                                                                                                   * Tiktoks shop is not available in canada as today



                                                                                                                                                      * Personalization and immediacy enhance appeal: Limited-time offers, exclusive drops, and live-stream shopping create urgency and leverage social engagement to encourage purchases.





	How can we make sure we offer a seamless purchase experience?





                                                                                                                                                      * Platform-Specific Strategies

TikTok & Meta: Maximize in-app purchasing by using native shops, live streams, and shopping stickers.

                                                                                                                                                         * For platforms that don’t yet support in-app purchasing in your market (e.g., TikTok Shop in Canada), provide quick redirects with minimal steps to maintain a near-seamless experience.

                                                                                                                                                         * YouTube & Pinterest: Optimize redirect flows with pre-filled carts and ensure mobile optimization to minimize drop-offs.





                                                                                                                                                         * Implement one-click checkout and stored payment methods wherever possible to reduce friction.

                                                                                                                                                         * Guest check-out

                                                                                                                                                         * recipe creators to use HF’s operational system to create and sell meal kits independently and promote them via social media channels in order to use a new revenue stream and connect with their followers



                                                                                                                                                         * Prospects, to purchase recipes from their favourite influencers as meal kits with high quality ingredients, next day delivery to their home with OTP, to being able to cook them easily



                                                                                                                                                         * HF Actives, to purchase recipes from different food influencers in their weekly subscriptions that strengthens their value and variety perception in the service





The main difference we see between the MVP (left) and the bigger vision (right) is the level of control: 

                                                                                                                                                            * with the MVP we having the highest control: creating recipes together with 3–5 big/medium chefs/influencers, vet the recipes quality before making them purchasable



                                                                                                                                                            * An iteration could mean more control: testing a ‘HF vetted’ stamp feature, where many influencers can create their recipes, some might be vetted, others not



                                                                                                                                                            * Towards an open marketplace: where everyone can create recipes but we need to make sure to bring some kind of quality insurance (vetted/review based quality check, …)



  



  











Q: What is our major goal?

Do we actually need a standalone vertical to unlock this new monetization opportunity, or can we achieve similar outcomes, highly personalized content, new revenue streams, creator partnerships within or adjacent to our current systems with significantly less operational and technical complexity?

1.Proposal for our 8-week discovery

Oct 27, 2025

Hey Ian, Jama and Nikita,

quick update and proposal for how we move forward after the kick-off:

We initially discussed exploring two tracks: the mission and the vision to validate the broader platform idea. I’d like to keep both tracks alive in this first sprint, but with a slightly different approach while Katie (Researcher) is out.

I’ll focus on:

                                                                                                                                                                     * Building early prototypes for both tracks using magic patterns and quick concept sketches

                                                                                                                                                                     * Doing secondary research and a competitor scan to inform those directions

                                                                                                                                                                     * and sharing short video walkthroughs of each concept so everyone can easily review and comment asynchronously across time zones

This approach helps us make fast, visible progress, collect more concrete hypotheses for our discovery backlog and be in a great position to move into structured research and prototype evaluation once Katie is back in Sprint 2.

If that direction sounds good, I’ll move ahead with setting up the Miro boards and async feedback loop.

Thanks all, looking forward to getting these early prototypes out there!

	Kick-Off Summary: HelloFresh Creator Marketplace

Original Transcript

Vision

Transform HelloFresh from a meal-kit provider into a universal food fulfillment platform: the “Spotify for food.”

 A place where any creator, customer, or institution can share a recipe that HelloFresh fulfills with precision and freshness.

[Shift: “Created by HelloFresh” → “Fulfilled by HelloFresh.”]

1. Strategic opportunity

                                                                                                                                                                     * Consumers already save and share recipes on TikTok, Instagram, and Pinterest, but rarely cook them

                                                                                                                                                                     * HelloFresh can bridge digital inspiration and real-world execution, leveraging its operational excellence in sourcing, portioning, and delivery

                                                                                                                                                                     * Long-term vision: any recipe online could be orderable via HelloFresh (a “Cook with HelloFresh” button across the web)



2. Who could be a Creator?

Four core creator types define the opportunity:

                                                                                                                                                                        1. Customers / Home cooks: share personal or family recipes.

                                                                                                                                                                        2. Public creators / influencers: expand reach and drive cultural relevance.

                                                                                                                                                                        3. Institutional content owners: NYT Cooking, Epicurious, etc.

                                                                                                                                                                        4. AI-generated recipes: emerging content category for experimentation.



3. Platform strategy: Early Stage vs. Long-term





Early Stage: Pilot

Run parallel pilots (e.g., influencer-only model vs. open model) to see what works before scaling or hardwiring it into the core business.

                                                                                                                                                                           * Curated creator onboarding: Only work with selected “whale” influencers or trusted creators at first, to ensure content quality and avoid PR risk

                                                                                                                                                                           * Quality assurance and trust focus: HelloFresh keeps control over what recipes go live, testing operational feasibility and brand impact

                                                                                                                                                                           * Modular, testable pilots: First pilots must be modular and reversible and “no one-way doors  so the team can learn fast and adjust the model (test small, learn, and iterate)





Long Term

Once the platform is validated

                                                                                                                                                                           * Open, scalable marketplace: platform shouldn’t stay curated forever, it should become an open “creator platform” where anyone (customers, influencers, institutions, even AI) can upload recipes, similar to Spotify or YouTube

                                                                                                                                                                           * Customer ratings and transparency: Instead of HelloFresh manually approving recipes, the community’s reviews and ratings would determine which recipes succeed, shifting accountability from HelloFresh to creators

                                                                                                                                                                           * Ubiquitous ‘fulfilled by HelloFresh’ ecosystem: The long-term ambition is that recipes across the internet could be instantly fulfilled by HelloFresh, a “Cook with HelloFresh” button on any recipe site.





4. Considerations: Brand & Trust

Risks (Joanna GCI):

                                                                                                                                                                           * Quality inconsistency could erode HelloFresh’s premium brand

                                                                                                                                                                           * Customers associate the HelloFresh name with trust and reliability; unclear content sourcing could confuse.

Mitigations:

                                                                                                                                                                           * Pilot in Canada (4% of revenue) for controlled learning.

                                                                                                                                                                           * Maintain HelloFresh-verified recipes alongside creator content.

                                                                                                                                                                           * Clear labeling and customer feedback loops to ensure transparency.

                                                                                                                                                                              * Key motivations: variety, convenience, and the ability to cook social-media recipes easily

                                                                                                                                                                              * Concerns: recipe reliability and ingredient accuracy



6. Competitive Context

                                                                                                                                                                                 * Platforms like Instacart, NYT Cooking, and TikTok Shop are moving into “shop by recipe” experiences.

                                                                                                                                                                                 * HelloFresh’s portion control + fulfillment quality remain unique advantages.

                                                                                                                                                                                 * Speed to market is essential to secure category leadership.

                                                                                                                                                                                 * Create a cross-functional “creator platform” team spanning tech, marketing, operations, and brand.

                                                                                                                                                                                 * Pilot readiness: explore Canada launch to validate model economics and risk management.

                                                                                                                                                                                    * Pistachio

	Novelty, cultural influence, restaurant adoption, social media

	Becomes a sustained pantry staple or industry ingredient, not just a viral moment. Shows up in menus, packaged foods, and persists for 1–3 years or more.

	Recipe 

🧇

	A specific recipe or cooking method spreads widely

	                                                                                                                                                                                    * Smashed burger

                                                                                                                                                                                    * baked feta pasta

                                                                                                                                                                                    * butter boards

                                                                                                                                                                                    * cottage cheese ice cream

	Visual appeal, ease of replication, social media virality

	Moves from viral video → regular home-cooking → menu appearances. A fad recipe spikes quickly then disappears; a trend recipe reshapes how people cook (e.g., smash techniques, air fryer recipes).

	Seasonal 

🍂

	Foods that recur in a predictable, cyclical pattern

	                                                                                                                                                                                    * Pumpkin spice

                                                                                                                                                                                    * holiday cookies

                                                                                                                                                                                    * summer watermelon drinks

                                                                                                                                                                                    * winter braises

	Seasonal produce, weather patterns, cultural calendars

	Recurs every year and becomes an expected behavior. A fad is one-off; a seasonal trend has durable annual cycles and industry planning behind it.

	Health-Driven 

👩‍⚕️

	Foods tied to wellness, nutrition, or perceived health benefits

	                                                                                                                                                                                    * High-protein foods

                                                                                                                                                                                    * gut-health ferments

                                                                                                                                                                                    * low-sugar options

                                                                                                                                                                                    * adaptogens

	New research, media coverage, wellness culture

	Sustains because it aligns with long-term health motivations. A fad diet spikes then fades; a health trend reshapes product development and dietary habits over multiple years.

	Lifestyle/Identity 

🧑‍🎤

	Eating based on values, ethics, or lifestyle

	                                                                                                                                                                                    * Plant-based eating

                                                                                                                                                                                    * vegan baking

                                                                                                                                                                                    * low-waste cooking

                                                                                                                                                                                    * keto/paleo

	Ethical alignment, identity expression, long-term value shifts

	More durable and culture-driven than fads. A fad is behavior without identity; a lifestyle trend shapes identity, purchasing decisions, and often persists for decades.

	Experience/Format

🍸

	How food is presented, prepared, or eaten

	                                                                                                                                                                                    * Air fryer cooking

                                                                                                                                                                                    * charcuterie boards

                                                                                                                                                                                    * crunch-topping everything

                                                                                                                                                                                    * tinned fish boards

                                                                                                                                                                                    * clear cocktails

	Convenience, aesthetics, shareability, texture obsession

	Unlike a fad format (e.g., rainbow food), a true trend changes behaviors—like widespread adoption of air fryers or texture-focused menu innovation. Fads stay surface-level; trends shift habits.

	Biggest challenges are the algorithm, time & effort

                                                                                                                                                                                    * The algorithm is a major challenge, constantly changing across platforms, making it difficult to stay visible. 

                                                                                                                                                                                    * Even when users follow someone, they may go weeks without seeing their content. Keeping up with platform-specific trends, trending audios, and frequent algorithm updates adds to the complexity.

                                                                                                                                                                                    * Editing and adapting videos to meet the unique requirements of each platform is demanding and time-consuming, especially when managing multiple channels.

	Seek Data & Analytics to learn and adapt

Creators lack visibility into what content or recipes resonate most with users. While not always stated directly, their struggle to identify trends and understand audience interest suggests a need for clearer, data-driven guidance. 

Access to metrics like top-selling recipes, conversion rates, and quality feedback would help them make more informed decisions about what to create next.

	                                                                                                                                                                                    * Develop a creator-facing analytics dashboard that highlights trending content, best-performing recipes, and user engagement insights, similar to TikTok’s Creator Search Insights. This would give creators the data they need to stay aligned with user demand, optimize their content strategy, and reduce guesswork.

	Mixed feelings on value proposition

                                                                                                                                                                                    * However, a consistent sentiment emerged: they believe the service would deliver strong value to their audiences, especially when it includes hard-to-source or expensive ingredients (e.g., pistachio paste for the viral Dubai chocolate trend). This suggests creators see clear audience benefits even if they personally weigh the trade-offs.

Current Gap

                                                                                                                                                                                    * How often do creators believe their audiences actually want specialty or trend-driven recipes versus more accessible, everyday options?





                                                                                                                                                                                    * How important is it for them to independently create these meal kits in a new platform (and manage this additional platform ) vs. working with us in a brand partnership?

	  



	Cohesive brand ecosystem

There is an expectation to treat the creator's meal kit as a special, easy-to-use extension of their brand. 



To keep followers engaged, the kit must feel authentic. 

                                                                                                                                                                                    * include the creator’s logo

                                                                                                                                                                                    * Value seen in integrated "Live" Cook-Alongs with synchronized delivery

                                                                                                                                                                                    * Operations: talking to Melanie Schwind, there are possibilities to re-brand e.g. the Mealcard or using a neutral box instead

	  



	Ingredients are key: Quality, selection and transparency

                                                                                                                                                                                    * The system must be completely honest with creators and customers (ingredient substitutions and quality). If the kit has to use a slightly different kind of cheese than the one in the video, the creator must be able to tell the customer upfront to keep their trust. (quality is critical, especially for recipes with few ingredients.)





Vetting recipes

                                                                                                                                                                                    * Most creators' first expectation was that we would vet the recipes for quality control (ingredients are available). 

                                                                                                                                                                                    * If the expectation is that the creators vet their own recipes, one mentioned that different creators may have different quality standards (i.e. testing a recipe 5 times vs. making it once before posting).

                                                                                                                                                                                    * Suggested a "test run" and access to research on what customers are buying.

                                                                                                                                                                                    * However, not all creators share this view: one preferred a flat-rate payment similar to traditional brand deals, expressing uncertainty about sales volume and concern that generating meaningful revenue would require substantial posting. This reveals a spectrum of comfort levels with performance-based compensation and highlights the need to address creators’ confidence in the product’s sell-through potential.

Customer side

                                                                                                                                                                                    * Program must be priced reasonably and accessible for "everyday" use and suggesting additional financial incentives (50% off, free dessert) to convince users to buy

                                                                                                                                                                                    * Additionally, provide clear sales forecasting, audience fit insights, or promotional support to help creators feel more confident that their efforts will translate into meaningful sales without excessive posting pressure.

The key to a successful Influencer Marketplace lies in navigating consumer trust, which is based on authenticity and relatability (not just expertise). Major barriers include the perceived lack of professionalism (minimal recipe testing), deep skepticism of paid sponsorships, and the dominant fear of recipe failure (inaccuracy, bad taste, or impracticality). The strategy must therefore focus on prioritizing micro/nano-influencers, offering valuable "edutainment," implementing robust quality control and vetting, and actively building trust in the social commerce aspects to ensure reliable transactions.

A study (TIJER, 2024) found that ~91.8% of respondents emphasised that a food influencer’s trustworthiness affects their desire to engage with that content. [tijer.org]





                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2. Authenticity vs. authority:

Many people do like recipe-creator influencers, especially for inspiration, fun, and getting new ideas. But the level of trust is conditional: it depends on perceived authenticity, practicality, and how much the creator is “for content” versus “for cooking.”  [see 2ndary research tab]

                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1. Influencers = relatable trust; Traditional sources = expert trust. 

Food influencers are often trusted for their authenticity, they feel relatable, like “someone like me.” Followers believe influencers genuinely test products or recipes in real life. Traditional cooking sources (e.g., chefs, food magazines) are trusted for their authority, expertise, training, or editorial credibility. Audiences favor creators who are genuine, relatable, and skilled. 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                           2. Professionalism / rigor: 

Some creators are perceived as lacking "professionalism," admitting to only testing recipes once or twice. Many users distrust recipes from TikTok/Instagram until they are "vetted by other sources first." 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1. “A lot of the people I am seeing on social media lately lack what we used to consider ‘professionalism’ … admitting that they have only ‘tested’ a recipe once or twice…”  [Reddit: 2025, Recipe developers/ food content creators and the concept of "professionalism"]

Edutainment: Demand for content that is not just entertaining but also provides genuine utility and learning ("edutainment").



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 4. Sponsorship vs. Genuineness: High skepticism toward direct brand communication and traditional celebrity endorsements. Consumers are fatigued by an increase in sponsored content. Users question whether product endorsements are based on genuine love for the product or merely sponsored content. Consumers look for trusted guides whose partnerships reflect the brand's and creator's values, especially concerning topics like health, wellness, and ultra-processed foods (UPFs).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. On Reddit, people frequently raise doubts about how genuine recipe creators are, particularly when brand sponsorships are involved. “Part of me wonders if they genuinely love these products or if it’s all sponsored content disguised as authentic cooking.” [Reddit: 2025, Are food influencers actually cooking with the brands they promote or just faking it?]  

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    5. Value: Consumers aren’t just looking for a recipe for inspiration, they’re looking for people they trust to guide their decisions around what they eat, where they shop, and how they feel. [...] Food brands are no longer just selling products; they’re selling values and who they choose to partner with should reflect just that.

This study analyzed how celebrity and noncelebrity influencers affect consumer purchase intention, considering psychological factors like regulatory focus and perceived authenticity, based on three experiments in China, South Korea, and the United States. 

Key Findings: Noncelebrity influencers resulted in higher purchase intention than celebrity influencers. Regulatory focus moderated this relationship: Prevention-focused consumers showed stronger purchase intent for noncelebrity-recommended products, while promotion-focused consumers showed no significant difference.

Everyday Use: Some influencer recipes use overly specialized ingredients or equipment, making them less practical or accessible for "everyday home cooks."

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Solution Desirability: The primary driver for purchasing an influencer's recipe kit is the immediate, frictionless satisfaction of the inspiration moment, driven by emotional connection and convenience of instant fulfillment.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Remaining Gap: The primary driver of purchase is not explicitly isolated. While friction is a barrier and ease is an appeal, the direct correlation between emotional connection to the influencer and the final decision to purchase the kit is not clearly proven over, say, just novelty or convenience.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Price / Value:

Purchase decision is highly dependent on: 1) Perceived value of the service, 2) Relationship to their influencer, and 3) Competitive price towards Instacart-like services with a one-time purchase.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Remaining Gap:  Specifics on pricing are missing. What is the perceived price ceiling for a single-purchase kit? Is it closer to Instacart's grocery cost + fee, or a HelloFresh meal kit price? How do customers explicitly value the influencer relationship in monetary terms (e.g., are they willing to pay a $5 premium to support them)? No mention of Instacart-like services or comparison to them. "Would you pay a $X premium for this kit because it's from your favorite creator?"



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Prospects experience: 

Social media users want a friction-free, single-click checkout and ordering process (e.g., a "Cook This with HelloFresh" button) directly from the external recipe page, because their impulse is high, but their motivation to manually search/sign up/build a box is low.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Remaining gap: No direct confirmation of the "Cook This with HelloFresh" button concept. While the need for ease is proven, the specific utility of a direct external link versus an in-app purchase (like TikTok Shop) is not explicitly contrasted for food. The compliance evidence shows platforms deprioritize external links (Meta), which contradicts the feasibility of the proposed touchpoint.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Interest in Solution: 

HelloFresh Active customers will only adopt influencer recipes if they perceive a significant incremental value (e.g., novelty (variety), aspiration, supporting a creator) that justifies a potential premium or difference in complexity.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           * Remaining gap:  The "only adopt" condition remains a major gap. The insights confirm interest but do not confirm that the incremental value must justify a premium. This specific trade-off (Value vs. Premium Price) has not been tested.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Touchpoint: 

Success depends heavily on the placement and format within the existing HelloFresh platform, which must be easily accessible without disrupting the core meal kit ordering experience.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Remaining gap:   There are no insights on Active users' behavior within the HelloFresh app/website itself. How do they want to discover, filter, or integrate this new type of recipe? Will it be a separate tab, a pop-up, or blended into the existing menu? The assumption about not disrupting the core experience is untested.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * concept testing on different touchpoints

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Run A/B testing or a choice exercise between a pure in-app purchase (like TikTok Shop) versus an external click-through link to HelloFresh's dedicated landing page, to determine the actual preferred path despite platform limitations.

Empower influencers (food bloggers/ recipe creators) on social media to inspire and feed millions by turning their ideas (recipes)  into real, cookable meals, instantly fulfilled by HelloFresh.





Problem statement 

HelloFresh needs to figure out what kind of shoppable influencer program is currently working in the market, how to build it to attract both influencers and customers, and what the competitive and financial risks/opportunities are.

Collection of risks, concerns and our lack of knowledge





Understanding who are our Customer segment and archetypes for this: Identify who specifically finds this idea desirable and why.

Influencers (Partners, B2B)

We lack understanding of ‘the right pitch’ and ‘solution’ to attract influencers in order to collaborate with us to build this capability:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Attraction:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * JTBD: What are their jobs to be done? (Understand what would make a business partner adopt and champion this solution)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Value prop drivers: What are their desires? Needs? Motivations? What solution do they grave? What would they agree to offer us? 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Emotional driver: Why is that attractive to them?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Adoption barriers & trust factors: 

Understand what would stop someone from adopting your solution: cognitive, emotional, or practical barriers. What’s a dealbreaker for them? (e.g. Exclusivity for us but feeling locked-in?) 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Brand: What brand concerns do they have? (e.g. Is partnering with HF attractive? Do they need assurances to protect their brand if something happens?)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Quality: how would they feel if there is a need to vet their recipes by HF?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * What if we need to change their recipe because of issues? How would they feel about it?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Fulfillment: What if we can not fulfill a recipe due to special ingredients?

How to distinguish between ‘created by HF’ vs. ‘Created by influencer’? Would they want/need this?

We believe that mid-to-large-tier content creators want a revenue share model where their cut (and secondary commissions on subsequent orders) significantly exceeds current affiliate/sponsorship rates and requires minimal effort for recipe submission, because the financial reward must clearly outweigh the time/effort required to manage an additional platform and redirect their existing, high-value audience.

	What is attractive to them as a revenue-sharing model that is fair to both sides?

How would each partner evaluate “fair value” in this deal?

	Quality insurance

We believe that food influencers and celebrity chefs need to understand that the "HelloFresh Test Kitchen Approved" stamp is a necessary co-branded trust mark that is only awarded after internal vetting, because they seek the halo effect of quality assurance and the increased conversion rates that come from the HelloFresh brand sanctioning their recipe, which ultimately leads to higher revenue share.

We believe that current social media users primary driver for purchasing an influencer's recipe as a kit is the immediate, frictionless satisfaction of the inspiration moment, driven by emotional connection and the convenience of instant fulfillment (i.e., simplifying the "job to be done" of cooking a desired, aspirational meal).

	Feasibility

	Seamless User Experience & Adoption Barriers (Friction Points)

	Prospects/Followers

	Prospects experience

We believe that social media users want a friction-free, single-click checkout and ordering process (e.g., a "Cook This with HelloFresh" button) directly from the external recipe page, because their impulse to try a new, exciting recipe is high, but their motivation to manually search, sign up, or build a box is low, creating a need for instant fulfillment.

We believe that Active users' trust in the HelloFresh brand is paramount; they will expect the company to maintain its quality guarantee for all recipes on the platform and need to see a clear "HelloFresh Test Kitchen Approved" stamp or vetting label next to the recipe, because they are skeptical that a recipe from an external source will meet the high standards for accuracy, ingredient portioning, and ease of execution they associate with the core HelloFresh product.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * They have varying budgets and willingness to pay, depending on demographics (e.g., young followers may love the idea but not afford it).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * They are used to digital, impulse-driven purchases: a swipe-up or one-click checkout aligns with their buying habits.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Limited patience for complex sign-up or ordering processes: friction could kill conversions.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * They expect high visual alignment between what they saw online and what they receive: unboxing and presentation matter.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * They may be more loyal to the influencer than the meal kit brand: meaning retention may depend on the influencer’s continued involvement.

Social Dynamics

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * They might seek validation or community connection: participating in the influencer’s world makes them feel part of something.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Word-of-mouth potential is high: these followers may post their own content, amplifying reach.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * They expect authenticity: if the meal kit feels overly commercial or off-brand, they may disengage.





General Prospects

Awareness & Perception

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Brand credibility matters more than influencer association: they’ll look for signs of quality, trust, and professionalism first.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * They might perceive influencer co-branded products as gimmicky: some may need reassurance of authenticity or quality.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * They may assume the recipes are trendy or niche, which could be a draw or a deterrent depending on preferences.

Motivations & Drivers

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * They’re motivated by convenience: ready-to-cook meals with fresh ingredients and minimal effort

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * They need confidence in consistency: since they can’t rely on “trust” in the influencer, the product experience itself must carry that weight.

Engagement & Relationship

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * They might grow interest in the creators post-purchase: exposure to creator content through packaging or QR codes could spark followership.

Potential Barriers

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * “Influencer” association could reduce perceived seriousness: some may see it as a novelty rather than a legitimate culinary product

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Perceived complexity: if they think they have to “cook like an influencer,” it may intimidate less confident cooks.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Creative extension of their brand: the opportunity to make their recipes “real” for followers validates their expertise.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Desire for credibility and legitimacy: a collaboration with a respected meal kit brand can elevate their reputation as a serious food authority.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Access to production and distribution infrastructure: they can bring their recipes to life at scale without managing logistics.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Increased reach and exposure: partnership could introduce them to new audiences (existing meal kit customers).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Emotional reward of impact: seeing fans cook their recipes at home creates a deeper form of connection.

Value Perception

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * They will assess alignment with their personal brand: tone, quality, and audience values must match.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * They value transparency in compensation: whether through revenue share, flat fee, or commission model.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Loss of authenticity: fear that followers will see this as “selling out.”

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Brand tone mismatch: influencers may see the meal kit brand as too corporate or mainstream.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Revenue uncertainty: unclear or unproven monetization model could deter participation.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Competitive concerns: they may already have sponsorships with grocery or food brands.

Problem Statement

Hellofresh sees a huge opportunity to be the ‘fulfillment and logistics’ bridge between Influencer and Followers that the influencers' inspiration (recipe) becomes a real shoppable, cookable meal kit for the consumers to order to their homes.

We see the urgency to act now, because influencers are already trying to solve this problem by building solutions themselves via Instacart or partnering up. 





HelloFresh needs to figure out what kind of shoppable influencer program is currently working in the market, how to build it to attract both influencers and customers, and what the competitive and financial risks/opportunities are.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Subscription Flexibility & Commitment: A significant barrier for them is the lack of subscription flexibility, rigid cutoff dates, and past frustrations with delivery, making it hard for their changing plans to align with meal kit services ('Efficient Inspired - who they are'). They dislike being locked into a meal plan ('Efficient Inspired - who they are').



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Food Waste: They have a strong aversion to wasting food (and the money associated with it), which often results from changing plans or having to purchase specialty ingredients for single, infrequent use ('Efficient Inspired - who they are', 'Segment characteristics GBT').

They find it annoying to acquire many different herbs and spices that are only used once a year ('Efficient Inspired - who they are').



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Catering to Diverse Preferences: It is often inconvenient but important for them to prepare meals that satisfy the varied tastes and dietary needs of everyone in their household ('Efficient Inspired - who they are', 'Segment characteristics GBT').

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Grocery Shopping Inconvenience: Their tendency not to plan long-term often leads to fragmented, last-minute, and sometimes repetitive grocery shopping trips for bits and pieces, which they find annoying ('Efficient Inspired - who they are').

Which platform being used for trends, culture moments

https://brandfolder.sproutsocial.com/VXTUTVL1/at/c5xxww63p5qnmhqrw5qsrb9n/index_2025_what-consumers-want-on-social.pdf In pursuit of discovering trends and participating in cultural moments, consumers are present on all social media platforms. But they are most likely to have Facebook, Instagram and YouTube profiles, and use these well-established networks to keep up with the zeitgeist. If they could only use one social media network, they would choose Facebook, followed closely by Instagram. 





This varies for Gen Z, who is most likely to have Instagram (89%), YouTube (84%) and TikTok (82%) profiles instead—a defining generational difference. 





When it comes to keeping up with trends and cultural moments, 51% of consumers prefer Facebook and Instagram and 37% prefer YouTube and TikTok.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Key Drivers & Behavior: The growth is primarily fueled by Millennials (ages 29-44) and Gen Z (ages 13-28), who are highly active social shoppers.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * The Path to Purchase: The appeal of social commerce is its ease, convenience, and low-friction transition from discovery to purchase ("buy with less effort"). Personalized buying options and stored payment information speed up checkout.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Direct-to-Platform Sales: Brands are increasingly offering in-app purchases to eliminate navigation away from the social platform, standing to benefit most by integrating seamless, credible, in-platform shopping experiences.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Platform Shopping Mechanisms:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Meta (FB/IG): Unified storefronts via Commerce Manager (Shops/Marketplace). Businesses are advised to use shoppable posts/Reels and Shops Ads, as external links in captions are deprioritized.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * TikTok: Strong, seamless, one-stop-shop experience via TikTok Shop (in-app checkout).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * YouTube: Integrated shopping features (merch shelf, product tagging) require connecting an online store via a supported partner platform (e.g., Shopify).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Pinterest: Primarily uses Product Pins to redirect to the merchant's external website.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Opportunity for Small Businesses (influencers): Social commerce is a crucial growth opportunity. Small businesses must focus on creating shoppable content directly on the platforms where their target audience (especially Millennials on Facebook) is active.





What We Can Learn From This (For a New B2B2C Business Targeting Millennials and Gen X):

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Focus Your Platform Strategy on Millennials (and Gen X): Since Millennials dominate social commerce on Facebook, this platform should be the primary focus for B2B2C efforts, particularly for driving purchase intent. While the data focuses on Millennials and Gen Z, Gen X (typically overlapping with older Millennials) often shares similar engagement patterns on Meta platforms.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Prioritize In-Platform Trust and Seamlessness: To overcome the main friction points (trust and logistics) and cater to the highly impulsive buying behavior:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Establish Trust: Work with B2B partners who can help guarantee product legitimacy and smooth logistics. Highlight credible reviews and clear return policies directly within the social shopping experience.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Enable In-App Checkout: Use Meta's Commerce Manager (Shops/Marketplace) to facilitate direct-to-platform sales. This minimizes friction and capitalizes on the "buy with less effort" appeal by leveraging stored payment info. Avoid relying on external links in captions.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Emphasize Discovery and Convenience: Social commerce is driven by impulse. Your strategy must focus on creating highly engaging, shoppable content (Reels, posts, Shops Ads) that captures attention and offers a low-friction path from discovery to purchase.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Leverage B2B Partners for Logistics: The B2B component should primarily solve the logistics challenge (shipping costs/delays) so the B2C experience remains seamless and trustworthy. Clear communication about delivery expectations is critical.

Social commerce trending

“We're witnessing the rise of the next wave of shopping on social media. Consumers are able to explore new products, deep dive into specific options, and purchase what they need, all within a single visit. Platforms are finding new ways to encourage purchase and, for many, it's working. Whether it's live streams on TikTok featuring limited-time offers, exclusive product releases for your followers on IG, or easter egging product drops on Reddit, dimensionalizing the shopping experience goes a long way for consumers.” Alexis Madison | Social Lead, Anomaly NYC https://www.gwi.com/reports/social-media-trends/explore?submissionGuid=7a5668a1-81bb-4b74-afec-1cb6bf9393af









While the Asia-Pacific region pioneered the concept, its adoption has climbed in the United States over the past years. Between 2023 and 2025, U.S. social shoppers escalated from roughly 96 million to around 104 million.

Social media advertising and influencer marketing campaigns remain essential for targeting and engaging the right audience. However, achieving conversions through these means has become increasingly challenging. 

As a result, an increasing number of brands and retailers are now providing the option to make purchases directly from their social media profiles, eliminating the need for customers to navigate away for transactions.





Spending

Social commerce is a growing industry in the United States. Forecasts suggest that the Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) of social commerce would hit 150 billion U.S. dollars by 2028, an increase of approximately 45 billion compared to 2025.





Another survey from GoDaddy found that 44% of Gen Z and 38% of Millennials said they would not spend more than US $50 on items purchased via social media. source

43% of consumers — an estimated 110 million individuals — browse social media to find goods and services, but just 14%, or approximately 36 million individuals, ultimately purchase those goods and services via social media.

	Gen Z and millennials, drivers of social commerce

The leap to buy from these platforms has been driven primarily by newer generations, namely Gen Z and millennials. A survey in the United States revealed that about half of social media users between 18 and 44 years old had made at least one purchase through this channel.

	9 in 10 Gen Z and Millennials Impulse Buy on Social Media GoDaddy

GoDaddy's (NYSE: GDDY) recent survey of 1,500 U.S. consumers reveals significant generational differences in social media shopping habits. Facebook emerges as the top platform, with 52% of Millennials making purchases there in the last three months, compared to 31% of Gen Z and 35% of Gen X and Boomers.





Key findings show that 90% of Gen Z and Millennials make impulse purchases on social media, with over half making monthly purchases. The survey identified fashion (37%), food (22%), and electronics (10%) as top purchasing categories. Most Gen Z (44%) and Millennials (38%) limit social media purchases to under $50.





Business legitimacy concerns (47%) and shipping issues are major deterrents across generations. The study also reveals platform preferences: Millennials strongly favor Facebook (67%), while Gen Z prefers Instagram (61%) and TikTok (48%) for business presence.

Social media shopping is about impulse purchases: Merchants must give shoppers quick, easy ways to go from browsing to paying to win customers. One of the appeals of social media shopping is the ease and convenience with which consumers can switch from browsing to buying: Users can quickly and easily make purchases as soon as they discover attractive products and new merchants. 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * 32% of consumers who transact on social media say they do so because it is easy and familiar, and 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * 28% say they do so because it allows them to buy with less effort and as soon as the product catches their attention. 

This reasoning underscores how crucial it is for social media platforms to have the right tools to facilitate users switching from browsing to buying mode. 





Other factors that encourage consumers to transact on social media include that consumers find products advertised there more attractive than those advertised on eCommerce sites, and that consumers can access personalized buying options and use stored identification and payment information to speed the checkout process.

This automatically syncs your product catalog, inventory, and pricing with your Facebook Shop.

This allows customers to browse your products on Facebook but directs them to your own platform to complete the transaction.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * External links:  Facebook's algorithm deprioritizes posts with external links in the main caption to keep users on the platform, so placing the link in the first comment is a recommended strategy to improve reach and engagement. This is because the algorithm favors content that keeps users on Facebook, and outbound links can lead to decreased engagement.

This creates a seamless experience where users click on the product tag, view details within Facebook, and then click a "Buy Now" or "Check Out on Website" button that takes them to your platform.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Utilize Shops Ads: Use paid advertising with "Shops ads" (formerly Dynamic Ads). These ads are optimized by Meta's machine learning to direct users to the destination (your website or your shop) where they are most likely to convert.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Leverage the "Shop" Tab: Encourage users to visit the dedicated "Shop" tab on your Facebook Page, which is a curated storefront of your products and is less likely to be penalized than generic external links in a newsfeed post.

If you want to use the integrated, seamless shopping experience on YouTube (merch shelf, product tagging), you need to use a supported platform. For general traffic and sales, you can use regular external links in descriptions and on your channel page.





Online store with a YouTube partner:

To create a shop on YouTube, you must first meet the eligibility requirements, then connect an existing online store from a supported e-commerce platform through YouTube Studio. YouTube partners with several e-commerce platforms, including Shopify, Spring, and Spreadshop.

	Consumer Pain/Challenge

	Opportunity for Marketplace/Brands

	Authenticity & Trust

	High skepticism toward direct brand communication and traditional celebrity endorsements. Consumers are fatigued by an increase in sponsored content.

	Authenticity Over Celebrity: Focus on connecting brands with highly relatable, credible, and expert micro- and nano-influencers who 'keep it real'.

	Content Value

	Demand for content that is not just entertaining but also provides genuine utility and learning ("edutainment").

	Invest in Edutainment: Prioritize content formats like how-to guides, tutorials, and informative video posts (especially on YouTube), blending education with entertainment.

	Platform Priority

	YouTube is recognized as the most authentic and beneficial platform for influencer content.

	Prioritize Video-First: Center strategies on video content and platforms like YouTube, which drives high engagement and perceived authenticity.

In 2023, CASE received 85 complaints related to social commerce (unfulfilled contracts, refunds, defective goods, delivery issues). Example: The Mdada case, where consumers faced delays in delivery and refunds, highlighting weak accountability when transactions occur outside official platforms.

Between Jan–Mar 2024, 104 victims lost over S$63,000 to scams linked to fake social media ads and phishing sites. Sellers’ identities are often unauthenticated, making fraud easier.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Fake Reviews: 

Many online reviews are deceptive, written by paid writers or bots, misleading consumers about product quality.

	Digital Influencers Promoting Healthy Food: 

The Role of Source Credibility and Consumer Attitudes and Involvement on Purchase Intention

https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/20/15002?utm_source=chatgpt.com





A study found that influencer credibility (which includes expertise/trustworthiness) positively affects consumer purchase intention.  For example: “source credibility … in the case of a digital influencer, as the perceived expertise, trustworthiness, and attractiveness …” 





Influencer Credibility & Purchase Intention:

 The study finds that digital influencers on Instagram positively affect consumers’ healthy food purchase intentions, primarily through their credibility (trustworthiness, expertise, and attractiveness).



Consumer Involvement & Attitudes:

 Consumers’ involvement with healthy food and their positive attitudes toward advertising also enhance purchase intention.  Higher involvement with Instagram strengthens influencer credibility and reduces advertising avoidance.



Advertising Avoidance & Engagement:

 Both advertising avoidance and engagement with healthy food significantly influence attitudes toward Instagram ads, which in turn boost purchase intentions.



Model Contribution:

 The study develops a comprehensive model combining the Theory of Source Credibility (TSC) and the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM)—an uncommon but effective integration in influencer marketing research. This combination helps explain how and why influencers persuade consumers, emphasizing the interplay between message source and consumer involvement.

	Consumer segments for influencer-impact

https://foodintegrity.org/the-new-experts-influencers-become-powerful-voice/?utm_source=chatgpt.com

CFI’s research (“Truth Defined: Mapping Consumer Beliefs in Food & Agriculture”) identifies five consumer segments; two in particular stand out for influencer-impact:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Authenticity Seekers (~14% of population): They want first-hand, unfiltered information, live experiences, and value transparency. Influencers help provide that when direct access is limited.

	https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367193094_The_effects_of_influencer_type_regulatory_focus_and_perceived_authenticity_on_consumers'_purchase_intention

Companies often use influencers to promote their products, and many celebrities have expanded their activities on social media as influencers. In this work, we classified influencers into celebrity and noncelebrity groups and analyzed how they affect consumers' purchase intention. We also analyzed how psychological variables, such as regulatory focus and perceived authenticity affect this process. We conducted three studies with consumers in China, South Korea, and the United States who participated in each between‐subjects experiment.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * The results showed that people have higher purchase intention for products recommended by noncelebrity influencers than those recommended by celebrity influencers. 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * We also found that regulatory focus moderates the relationship between the influencer type and consumers' purchase intention. Purchase intention for products recommended by noncelebrity influencers were stronger among prevention‐focused consumers. 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * However, no significant difference in the effect of influencer type was found among promotion‐focused consumers. We found that perceived authenticity mediated this moderating effect. The results of this study provide effective marketing strategies and implications for companies when they use influencers as a tool for marketing activities.

	



What are customer pains and concerns around food influencers?





Overall: many people do like recipe-creator influencers, especially for inspiration, fun, and getting new ideas. But the level of trust is conditional: it depends on perceived authenticity, practicality, and how much the creator is “for content” versus “for cooking.”

How can I trust a food influencer to provide great recipes?

Source: NotebookLM Collection of different papers

Building trust in a food influencer to provide "great recipes" is a multifaceted process that, according to the sources, relies heavily on the content's practical utility, the influencer's perceived credibility, and strong social proof.

The sources suggest that users actively assess both the recipe itself and the characteristics of the Food Expert Influencer (FEI) to determine trustworthiness and subsequent willingness to use the content.

I. Assessing the Influencer's Credibility and Authority

Trust begins with the perception of the content creator's knowledge and authority, particularly regarding food expertise.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1. Expertise and Competence: The perceived level of a food influencer's expertise has a positive impact on followers' consumer behavior,. The credibility and perceived competence of influencers play a pivotal role in engendering trust, subsequently impacting purchasing behavior and influencing consumption decisions,. Followers specifically look for FEIs who are regarded as experts, have experience in the concept of food, and show a good understanding of food.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   2. Shared Identity and Aspiration: Influencers often serve as a reference group. Consumers may be persuaded by influencers of the same gender due to social identity theories,. Furthermore, an FEI's attractive lifestyle, beauty, and sex appeal can exert considerable influence on consumer behavior. This is based on the idea that followers aspire to emulate the influencer's image and lifestyle,, and attractive individuals may receive more favorable attributions, including trustworthiness and expertise (the halo effect theory).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   3. Social Validation (Follower Count): The number of followers an influencer has also positively correlates with consumer behavior,. This reinforces the concept of social proof, suggesting that people tend to emulate behaviors adopted by a large number of others, implying that if many people follow an influencer, they must be reliable.

II. Assessing the Recipe and Content Quality

For a recipe to be considered "great" or trustworthy, users prioritize practical usability, clarity, and community validation.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1. Practicality and Usability: Users actively assess the feasibility of the recipes by checking the ingredients and the ease of the recipe. They are looking for meals that are quick and easy to make, and they value clear information on leftovers, making it ahead of time, or meeting specific health goals. The perceived ease of the recipe positively relates to a user's self-efficacy—their belief that they can successfully make the dish.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   2. Clarity and Format: Recipes are trusted when they are presented clearly and concisely. A major pain point for users is encountering recipes that include a "novel" or ten paragraphs about a blogger’s personal life before reaching the ingredient list. Users highly prefer:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Videos and Visuals: Videos are preferred because users can follow along, pause, and rewind,. Seeing the process makes the final product feel more attainable than static images, and seeing the actions in sequence provides helpful tips,.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Actionable Advice: Users prefer content that gives very little information, focusing instead on practical advice like adjustments for doubling a recipe or how to store and reheat leftovers.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   3. Community and Social Proof (The Gold Standard): One of the most critical ways users vet content is by relying on the community of people who have already tried the recipe.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Users check the comments and ratings to see what people who have made the social media recipe say,,.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Comments and reviews are often viewed as a "gold mine" because they provide helpful tips, tricks, and modifications that can improve a recipe,.

In short, to trust a food influencer, the sources suggest that you should look for evidence of documented expertise (not just aesthetic appeal), but most importantly, you should prioritize practical, easy-to-follow content validated by a strong community, as proven through numerous positive reviews and helpful modification comments,,.

You can think of trusting a food influencer as similar to hiring a home contractor: you assess their certifications and experience (expertise), you check their portfolio and how good their previous jobs look (aesthetic/lifestyle), but the ultimate deciders are the reviews from previous customers (comments/social proof) who can confirm the job was easy, clear, and successful,.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Provide brief, helpful explanations of why certain ingredients or techniques work.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Show mastery through tutorials of foundational skills (e.g., knife skills, emulsifying sauces, dough handling).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Encourage followers to leave honest reviews and share modifications.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Include practical notes:

	4. Use High-Quality Visual Demonstrations

Why it matters: Users trust what they can see, especially through video.

Actionable steps:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Prioritize step-by-step videos—show ingredients, techniques, textures, and common pitfalls.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Include close-ups of each stage of cooking to show realistic process and results.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Add captions that highlight important tips (e.g., “Stop whisking when it looks like this!”).



	5. Make Identity and Values Clear

Why it matters: Shared identity or aspiration increases trust (social identity + halo effect).

Actionable steps:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Share a concise story about your cooking style or philosophy (e.g., budget-friendly, healthy comfort food, cultural heritage).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Show personality and lifestyle without overshadowing recipe clarity.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Be authentic—don’t lean solely on aesthetics or attractiveness as proof of expertise.



	6. Provide Transparency and Consistency

Why it matters: Consistency builds long-term trust.

Actionable steps:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Test recipes multiple times and say so explicitly.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Admit when something is imperfect or still being improved.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Be consistent in posting style, measurement units, and recipe formatting.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Avoid partnerships that don’t align with your cooking values (e.g., promoting ingredients you never use).





	7. Showcase Community Learning

Why it matters: Comment sections are viewed as a “gold mine” for users.

Actionable steps:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Pin top comments that include tips, modifications, or successful user results.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Respond to user questions so people see active, ongoing support.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Parental satisfaction with content is low (e.g., only ~20% satisfied in one study). This suggests interest may be there, but quality or relevance may be lacking.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * The influence of food bloggers/influencers on actual kids’ meals or parental behaviour in that specific “kids-friendly food blog” niche is not deeply quantified (as opposed to general food influencer effect).



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Some studies focus on children and their exposure to influencers or marketing, rather than on parents and their follower behaviour.

🎯 Implications

Given the data, we can reasonably infer that:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * If you’re considering a strategy targeting parents via social media content around “kids-friendly meals”, there is a receptive audience. Many parents use Instagram/Facebook to search for child-nutrition/meal ideas.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * The “kids-friendly food blogger/influencer” niche likely has traction among parents who are already following more general food influencer content.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * However, because the data show many parents are not satisfied with the content they find, there may be an opportunity for “better quality” or more targeted kids-meal-focused content.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Also, given the skew toward unhealthy food marketing in many influencer-driven contexts, emphasising healthier “kids-friendly meals” may resonate (especially if parents are looking for healthier ideas).

Creators Insights









Major Key Insights Summary

The influencer marketing landscape is defined by platform diversification and an intense focus on authentic, high-value content driven by shifting audience demographics and demands. 

TikTok is maturing into a key, affluent target for brands as its audience ages, though Instagram and YouTube remain integral for community and evergreen content, respectively, with content increasingly tailored to each platform's unique algorithm (e.g., long-form retention on TikTok vs. short, snackable inspiration on Instagram). 

The industry is now mainstream, with strong agency-reported ROI, especially on TikTok, but it faces rising challenges, including content moderation risks, audience skepticism from heavy commercialization, and the need for creators to diversify income streams (beyond flat fees, which are still the most preferred compensation model) to hedge against unpredictable algorithms and platform policies.



Key Takeaways

Theme

	Insight

	Implication for Marketplace

	Platform Dynamics

	Instagram remains the primary platform for polished, long-term brand partnerships and high-production value content (aesthetics are key). TikTok is essential for trend-jacking, reach, and authenticity/spontaneity. YouTube drives in-depth tutorials, long-form reviews, and higher conversion rates due to trust/authority.

	The Marketplace must support multi-platform campaigns with differentiated content requirements. Creator profiles need to clearly detail expertise across these three platforms.

	Creator Monetization

	Creators prioritize platforms that offer the best direct monetization tools (e.g., YouTube ad revenue split, TikTok Creator Fund access) and ease of brand collaboration. Consistency in payment and clear briefs are highly valued.

	Our platform needs to streamline the briefing, contracting, and payment process, making it significantly easier than direct negotiations or other platforms.

	Content Vertical (Food/Culinary)

	Authenticity and relatability (e.g., home cooking, grocery hauls, quick meal prep) significantly outperform highly-produced, inaccessible content. The audience seeks actionable tips and ingredients/product recommendations.

	The Marketplace must facilitate campaigns centered on product integration (ingredients, appliances, delivery services) and 'recipe testing' collaborations rather than just generic brand promotion.

	Partnership Success

	Campaigns that give creators creative freedom within defined guardrails tend to perform better than overly restrictive ones. Clear communication of why a product fits the creator's niche is vital for internal buy-in and genuine promotion.

	Briefs must focus on campaign objectives and mandatory elements, leaving room for creator personality. Vetting creators based on true niche relevance (not just follower count) is critical.

How food creators engage followers (what they do and why it works)

Do creators want followers to actually make the recipes?

Increasingly, yes because “I cooked this” is a flywheel for trust, distribution, and revenue:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * It proves usefulness → more saves & shares → more reach.

Parasocial research shows that when followers feel taught and cared for, their intentions to adopt the creator’s behaviors (e.g., home cooking) rise fueling repeat engagement and future purchases. (sr, sr)

Why some posts favor attention over execution

Not every video is meant to be cooked today. Trendy, aesthetic, or “food-as-entertainment” content earns discovery and cultural relevance; then creators channel that attention to cookable formats (blog posts with schema, shoppable lists, printable cards, paid meal plans). Still, followers widely report finding food/drink advice from influencers useful (56% across 17 markets). (sr)

Influencer managed Platformss

Influencer managed Platforms









We are creating for influencers something that they  would want to log in to track the amount their recipes are selling and the amount they are making as well as add new recipes, etc. 

What is similar to this is influencers wanting to log in to see how much money they are making in their affiliate marketing and change the brands that they are working with in a management tool. NOTE: What these will not have is the product side where the influencer is also adding and editing a product. That research would come more from a commerce platform.

Why proper payment matters

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           * Content creation is a profession, not a hobby: prompt and fair payment shows respect for influencers’ work.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           * Fair pay drives better results: well-compensated creators produce higher-quality, more authentic content and invest more effort.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           * Clarity builds trust: clear payment terms prevent confusion, delays, and strained relationships.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           * Reputation attracts talent: brands known for paying fairly and on time become preferred partners among creators.

Sponsored posts most popular

Brands pay you to create content featuring their products or services. Payment can be a set fee, commission, or even free products (which can trigger tax implications in Germany).





Affiliate marketing

You promote a product or service using a unique link or discount code. You earn a commission whenever your followers make a purchase using your link. This is common in niches like fashion, beauty, and tech. It’s an attractive option for smaller influencers, as you don’t need a massive following to start earning.





Selling your products

Some influencers develop and sell physical or digital products (e.g., eBooks, merchandise, or courses). Instagram provides tools like Instagram Shopping to tag products in posts, making it easy for followers to purchase directly.





Services (e.g., consulting, caption writing, or photography)

Plenty of freelancers in Germany use Instagram to market their services. This could be anything from lifestyle photography to social media consulting. You showcase your portfolio on Instagram and land freelance gigs through your profile.





Dropshipping

In the dropshipping model, you sell products online without holding inventory. Your supplier handles the storage and shipping, and you focus on marketing the items on Instagram. Remember that in Germany, if you run a dropshipping business, you generally need a registered trade license (Gewerbeanmeldung) and must adhere to specific tax obligations.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Platform Fragmentation: Social media use is becoming more polarized and fragmented, suggesting users are declining overall platform use or concentrating heavily on fewer platforms, potentially leading to echo chambers.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Instagram & YouTube Remain Integral: Marketers still view Instagram as a major platform for creators, and YouTube continues to offer massive ad reach across a broad age range.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Facebook's Declining Relative Importance: While still massive globally, Facebook is suggested to be declining in importance for influencer campaigns relative to others.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Authenticity is Key: Audiences favor authentic, user-generated content (UGC), which brands are investing in to appear more genuine.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Creator Diversification: Nano- and micro-influencers (small followings) still drive very high engagement, especially on TikTok.

Short, high-impact, polished Reels are ideal for providing "snackable" inspiration and driving fast engagement from a loyal community.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * YouTube (Evergreen/Education): The platform is best for long-form, detailed, step-by-step tutorials and technique deep dives. SEO optimization (keywords) and professional thumbnails are crucial for discoverability and high click-through rates.

There’s real value in older, more affluent demographics, especially on TikTok.

✅ Why “quick shorts” work better on Instagram for her community

1. Instagram prioritizes familiarity and existing relationships

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Instagram’s algorithm leans heavily on your social graph (people you follow, people who interact with you often).



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * So if she already has a loyal follower base, Instagram will push her short videos to those people first.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Short, punchy content is easy for an existing audience to engage with quickly → IG sees fast engagement → boosts it further.



Result:

 Her community sees her short videos → likes, saves, comments → Instagram boosts them more.

2. Instagram Reels reward “snackable” visuals — cooking looks great in short form

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * A 10–15 sec recipe hack, transition, or finished dish performs extremely well on IG because:

✅ Why TikTok sends her content to more random people and rewards longer videos

1. TikTok’s algorithm is built for “topic discovery,” not just community

TikTok doesn’t care who follows you — it cares what people like watching.

So:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * She will naturally reach more strangers on TikTok.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Loyal followers matter MUCH less than watch time.



2. TikTok values “retention time,” not just completion

This is crucial:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * A 20–30 second short may get watched fully…



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * But a 1–2 minute cooking video where people watch 50–80% gives TikTok MUCH better retention data.



More watch time = bigger push onto the For You Page (FYP).

How Cooking Creators Should Tailor Their Content per Platform

1. TikTok

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Focus on Discovery & Virality

 TikTok is very discovery-driven. Use trends, sounds, and effects to reach new people. Short, punchy, fun cooking videos do really well. kgime.com+2Hypefy+2



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Use Strong Hooks

 Because people swipe fast: open with a “wow” moment — the final dish, a surprising step, or a quick visual tease. Backstage



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Leverage Text Overlays / Voiceovers

 Use text overlays to highlight ingredients or steps, or voiceover to explain what’s happening. These help guide people quickly through the process. Backstage



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Optimize for Retention

 Longer videos (1–2 minutes) can perform better if they retain viewership, especially for cooking processes. kgime.com



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Make Content Dynamic

 Use transitions, close-ups, speed-ups, slow motion — anything to keep visual momentum. Backstage

2. Instagram (Feed, Reels, Stories)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Short Inspirational Reels

 Create quick recipe hacks, transitions, or “before and after” food shots in Reels. These are snackable and easy to consume for your existing audience.

 Because Instagram often emphasizes existing followers/fans: build content that speaks to who already follows you. Share more personal moments behind the scenes, your kitchen setup, or your favorite “go-to” recipes.

	How Is Recipe Quality / Content Credibility Ensured?

Here’s what I found about quality control and vetting for Tastemakers’ recipes:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. No Formal Recipe Vetting by Instacart



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * There’s no strong evidence that Instacart themselves editorially “tests” or “vets” all Tastemaker recipes for quality, nutrition accuracy, or culinary soundness. The program is more about enabling creators to monetize their existing content.

The list is organized by store section (produce, dairy, pantry, etc.) so that shopping is more efficient. 



But: doesn’t seem to have built-in online grocery ordering integrations





                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Step-by-Step Cooking Mode

Recify provides a cooking mode where you can follow recipe steps full-screen, which is helpful when cooking (so you don’t have to scroll or switch between apps). 



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * AI Recipe Chat (Planned / Upcoming)

According to Recify’s roadmap/features list, they plan or have a feature called “AI Recipe Chat”: you can ask questions like “What can I substitute for X?” or “How to cook this differently?” 



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Recipe Editing / Upload Options

You can manually add your own recipes (via photo, scan, or manual typing) to Recify.









Pro unlocks “unlimited importing” and multiple collections 









	No Built-In Influencer Hub





One of the core features is that you can import recipes from social-media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, or any website by copying a link into Recify. App Store+1



This means you can bring influencer recipes into your Recify library — but they live in your personal collection, not in a public “influencer gallery.”

Community flagging is common in open-access models.

Only TikTok Shop requires a specific follower minimum (1,000).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Include close-ups of each stage of cooking to show realistic process and results.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Add captions that highlight important tips (e.g., “Stop whisking when it looks like this!”).



	5. Make Identity and Values Clear

Why it matters: Shared identity or aspiration increases trust (social identity + halo effect).

Actionable steps:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Share a concise story about your cooking style or philosophy (e.g., budget-friendly, healthy comfort food, cultural heritage).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Show personality and lifestyle without overshadowing recipe clarity.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Be authentic—don’t lean solely on aesthetics or attractiveness as proof of expertise.



	6. Provide Transparency and Consistency

Why it matters: Consistency builds long-term trust.

Actionable steps:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Test recipes multiple times and say so explicitly.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Admit when something is imperfect or still being improved.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Be consistent in posting style, measurement units, and recipe formatting.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Avoid partnerships that don’t align with your cooking values (e.g., promoting ingredients you never use).





	7. Showcase Community Learning

Why it matters: Comment sections are viewed as a “gold mine” for users.

Meeting records Transcript Recording 





Summary

Annette MvdE led the meeting, focusing on the status of creator research, the plan for customer validation, and a critique of the validation prototype with Ian Brooks, Katheryn Eckles, Melanie Schwindt, Linnea Siersma, Sameer Doda, and Cole Banning participating. Katheryn Eckles reported on five creator interviews, with upcoming research moving into concept validation and a customer interview phase to understand the inspiration execution gap, marketplace value, and trust barriers. Participants discussed pricing models, with Ian Brooks and Linnea Siersma favoring a model where creators set their own margin, while Sameer Doda proposed a tiered, cost-plus approach, and Annette MvdE confirmed that the concept validation prototype will use a pitch deck to guide conversation and feature critique.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Meeting Context and Agenda Annette MvdE initiated the meeting, sharing the document link and planning to screen-share (00:00:00). The agenda focused on the status of creator research, the plan for the next customer validation round, and a prototype critique for the validation test (00:01:04). The goal was to cover everything in 60 minutes, though Ian Brooks noted they would try to keep their participation to 45 minutes (00:00:00).

* Creator Research Status Katheryn Eckles reported five creator interviews completed, covering a mix of creator sizes up to 1.2 million followers, with generally consistent insights (00:01:56). They found that one cookbook author saw no conflict in using their cookbook recipes on the platform for exposure and was aligned with commission-based compensation. The research is transitioning to focus on cookbook authors and higher-level influencers, probing deeper into their use of trends and vetting expectations (00:03:06).

* Creator Vetting and Data Needs The cookbook author interviewed acknowledged that customers might not fully understand if HelloFresh is not vetting recipes in an Amazon-style marketplace approach and might still blame the platform or the creator for bad recipes (00:04:20). Creators are interested in data points such as user interests, popular ingredients, cooking time, and site traffic (00:05:29).

* Concept Validation and Next Steps for Creator Research Katheryn Eckles stated that the interviews are moving into concept validation next week to obtain deeper insights into how creators see the platform working (00:05:29). The expected outcomes include stronger indicators of desirability and feature prioritization (00:07:34). Recruitment is ongoing, focusing on larger influencers, with the option to re-engage previous participants (00:06:32).

* Customer Research Plan The next phase of research will focus on customer interviews, building on signals from unmoderated tests and a survey that showed a significant inspiration execution gap (00:07:34). The goal is to understand how customers would use the service (e.g., for special occasions or daily purchases), the perceived value and trust in the influencer marketplace, and their needs and barriers related to trust and quality (00:08:49).

* Customer Research Methodology and Focus The customer interviews will involve HelloFresh prospects actively engaging with food content on social media, using 30-minute interview slots for efficiency. The research will cover creator dynamics, cooking behavior, trust, vetting, accountability, and marketplace utility/workflow. Katheryn Eckles aims for a pilot by the end of the week, starting early this week. Ian Brooks confirmed the focus on prospects is for efficiency, as unmoderated results showed no major differences between prospects and active customers (00:11:02) (00:13:16).

* Prototype Critique and Approach Annette MvdE presented the concept validation prototype, which was based on existing insights and secondary research (00:14:25). They explained that instead of a complete prototype, a pitch deck showing specific UI features will be used to guide conversation and answer research questions. They excluded a sign-up and storefront creation flow due to complexity and potential distraction (00:15:41).

* Recipe Import Feature and Collaboration Melanie Schwindt inquired about collaboration with the cookbook team regarding the recipe import option (e.g., video to meal kit link). Annette MvdE confirmed connection with the DAU team, who has a strategist and researcher on their team, and mentioned that they are exploring reusing code from other teams, citing a specific initiative linked to Lisa Tupplot and Nikita (00:16:47).

* Creator Onboarding Flow in Prototype Annette MvdE outlined the prototype flow: creators imagine scrolling through reels, seeing a CTA button to shop a meal kit, clicking through to a landing page, and then navigating to a page specifically for creators that briefly explains the platform idea (00:17:49). The flow then moves into features, starting with how creators would add recipes, either by importing existing content (URL, file upload, video) or starting from scratch using HelloFresh analytics/data for inspiration (00:18:55).

* Ingredient Availability and Pricing Concerns Annette MvdE raised questions about ingredient availability, asking if they need to be in the warehouse when a recipe is published, and whether ingredients would need to be reserved for a specific time frame (00:21:27). Ian Brooks suggested testing the attributes of ingredients creators need to select (e.g., gram weight, form factor) (00:22:34). Melanie Schwindt and Linnea Siersma agreed that the ingredient selection interface should be intuitive, resembling online grocery shopping rather than internal specifications (00:23:38).

* Creator Pricing Models Melanie Schwindt raised the need to determine the pricing approach, whether showing unit cost or a tiered pricing model (00:24:27). Annette MvdE questioned if the ingredient price would remain stable or change over time due to factors like shortages (00:25:27). Linnea Siersma suggested that ideally, the pricing should reflect the customer pricing as they build the recipe, acknowledging that subscription status and shipping costs will add nuance to the final customer price (00:26:20).

* Core Pricing Approaches Discussion Ian Brooks proposed two core pricing approaches: one where HelloFresh charges a service fee and the creator sets the price to the customer, allowing them to determine their own margin; and a second model where HelloFresh sets the consumer price (cost plus) with a prescribed margin for the creator (00:27:15). Linnea Siersma favored the former model, seeing HelloFresh's role as offering its fulfillment engine as a service (00:28:26).

* Tiered Pricing and Creator Incentive Sameer Doda compared the platform to the Amazon Marketplace, suggesting that high-following influencers should have flexibility in pricing (00:31:09). Sameer Doda proposed a middle path with tiered, cost-plus pricing (e.g., 80% premium cost plus for top tier, 30% for small following) to differentiate influencers and incentivize them to increase reach (00:32:08). Cole Banning argued against complexity, suggesting the incentive is simply that selling more equals making more money, and supported creators setting their own margins, comparing it to the Amazon Marketplace (00:33:06).

* System Self-Correction and Pricing Testing Annette MvdE suggested that many pricing issues might resolve themselves, as high prices or low quality would deter buyers, making the system self-correcting (00:34:12). Katheryn Eckles asked if they should query creators about the potential pricing models, but Ian Brooks advised against it, stating their answer would only be "as much as possible" (00:35:24). Ian Brooks emphasized that the platform must align creator and HelloFresh incentives, initially giving creators a larger share of the profit (00:36:42).

* Recipe Creation Workload and Quality Assurance Annette MvdE highlighted the need to show creators that building a recipe from scratch requires work and must be accurate for the meal kit format (00:36:42). Melanie Schwindt raised questions for Canada about the use of recipe cards, whether they should be printed or digital, and if technology like Concord should be used for translation (00:37:52). Annette MvdE mentioned exploring if the recipe card could be branded for the influencer (00:38:59).

* Vetting and Quality Assurance Features Quality assurance features being considered include an AI tool to review recipes for issues like double ingredients or instructions, and the possibility of HelloFresh chefs vetting or even cooking the recipes (00:38:59). Melanie Schwindt suggested that "vetted by HelloFresh" could be a premium offering or incentive for top creators (00:40:03). Ian Brooks later suggested that vetting could become a paid service that creators buy to validate their recipe works for the meal kit format (00:41:05).

* Managing Meal Kits and Creator Analytics The managing section of the prototype will explore offering creators opportunities to make more out of their content by creating menus or meal plans, to gauge if this is something they currently do or would be interested in. Creators are also interested in analytics like platform traffic, trends, and the performance and sales of their recipes (00:42:07). Annette MvdE considered starting with Shopify for analytics but decided it would be too overwhelming, aiming for the top-tier analytics tools creators truly need (00:43:13).

* Customer Engagement and Community The engagement part of the prototype introduces features for customers who purchase a meal kit, allowing them to quickly create an account and engage with the creator via comments or communication (00:43:13). Ideas include having the community rate or modify a recipe, or the creator hosting live cooking events (00:44:19). Sameer Doda stressed that interaction would be highly valuable for influencers, and they might seek ways to increase customer feedback (00:47:43).

* Prototype Concerns and Moving Forward Linnea Siersma expressed concern about moving too quickly towards building before establishing product-market fit, suggesting that testing multiple fake versions of the website to gauge stickiness might be more beneficial than building a fully functional prototype (00:51:44). Katheryn Eckles reassured that the designs are informed by initial creator feedback (00:53:07). Annette MvdE acknowledged the concern, noting the company's current focus on "hands-on experiment" over deep exploration and promised to discuss smoke testing and ABC testing possibilities with Andrea and Mark to address fears of a large, unsuccessful investment (00:54:57).

* Final Sprint Planning and Recruitment For the final sprint, the team plans to finish the concept test research and provide recommendations, while continuing to act as a partner. Annette MvdE raised the critical concern of recruiting for the MVP, noting the need to identify who will drive this, involve legal for contract creation, and utilize existing relationships with chefs for the experiment (00:57:08). Melanie Schwindt noted that the revenue model will likely change over time, treating initial influencers differently, and that the model should not promise guaranteed income (00:48:47).

* Influencer Onboarding Ownership Cole Banning noted that the ownership of managing influencers for the platform, including legal aspects and dealing with issues, needs to be addressed by Ian. Cole Banning's team can handle minor tasks, such as small tests with existing HelloFresh menu influencers who might be interested in migrating to the new program, but cannot commit to the broader influencer program without senior direction. Annette MvdE requested that Melanie Schwindt or Linnea Siersma bring this question to Ian (00:58:23).

* Operations and Viability Update Annette MvdE inquired about the progress on the business case and operational side. Melanie Schwindt provided a brief summary, stating that they connected with the operations team and have a scrappy plan for fulfilling Minimum Viable Product (MVP) boxes. The Canada team will meet on Monday for a strategy brainstorming session to inform decisions on pricing and creator onboarding (00:59:29). Regarding potential test runs for influencers, Melanie Schwindt confirmed that influencers could buy their own meals, but the team needs to determine if a free test kit should be offered to everyone or only some people, as offering it to everyone would mean sending everyone free food (01:00:29).

* Project Driving and Involvement Linnea Siersma expressed confusion about who is driving the different project pieces, specifically operations and marketing recruitment, and how to stay connected without overstepping, given that it is Annette MvdE's project (01:01:28). Annette MvdE clarified that the current structure is different from previous projects and they, along with the researcher Katie, are only owning the strategy side, with others like Wonderly, Samir, and Melanie Schwindt driving the tech, operations, and business aspects individually (01:02:29). Annette MvdE noted that they are not an expert in those areas and are willing to be included if needed, despite time zone challenges (01:03:25).

* Moving Forward with the Project Linnea Siersma proposed that themself and Melanie Schwindt move forward at a pace appropriate for a Q2 test and keep Annette MvdE in the loop, allowing them to indicate if they want more or less involvement (01:03:25). Annette MvdE agreed with this approach, confirming that this is the new way of working, where everyone is encouraged to "just run and make it happen" (01:04:32). Annette MvdE also clarified that they believe the strategy team's role is primarily to help inform the MVP, which would have run anyway, to ensure they "are not running completely against the wall" (01:05:13).

* Future Research Collaboration and Tech Alignment Melanie Schwindt informed the team that the Canada team’s strategy working session on the vision might generate specific topics that would require Annette MvdE's team's support for research (01:05:13). Annette MvdE acknowledged that the director, Mark, or research lead, Andrea, would have to decide if they continue supporting this work or move to other roles, such as the loyalty team (01:06:09). The team also discussed the need to align on tech deliverables—specifically, what will be built and when—to ensure clarity on operations and strategy adjustments (01:06:55). Katheryn Eckles suggested that future research needs would be based on the clarity of the strategy and confirmed that they could advocate to stay on longer for research support if clear needs arise (01:08:38).





Suggested next steps

* Shay Obaidullah will read the research plan again and add any additional comments by the end of today so Katheryn Eckles can incorporate them before the pilot tomorrow.

* Annette MvdE will talk to Andrea and Mark about the possibility of implementing smoke testing and other options to quantify the product's resonance with customers and creators.

* Ian Brooks will take an action from the Canada side to build out the core pricing approaches with numbers.

* The group will figure out who will drive the topic of recruiting for the MVP (MVP squad, operation, or business side).

* Melanie Schwindt or Linnea Siersma will provide guidance on what attributes of an ingredient should be selected by the creators, based on what would feel intuitive like an online grocery store.

* Annette MvdE will talk to Mark or Andrea to figure out how Annette MvdE and Katheryn Eckles can help the Canada team on the path forward, especially with research support for specific topics identified in the strategy working session.

* Kathryn Eckles will work with Melanie Schwindt and Linnea Siersma to figure out what kind of research is needed and bring that to Mark and Andrea to advocate for staying on longer to help derisk the project.

* Melanie Schwindt and Linnea Siersma will move forward at an appropriate pace for a Q2 test and keep Annette MvdE in the loop regarding their involvement. Test

Influencer MP Sprint Review - Transcript

00:00:00

 

Annette MvdE: So I'm going to share um the link to our document. You can all follow me there. Um but I will also at some point like share my screen uh because I think this is like easier for everyone. Um so thank you for being here. We have a little bit like one or two new joiners here like Shay wanted to be part which I'm excited that you are here as well. Um, as I said, like I'm excited that Cole um was able to join here very short notice um because like I wanted just to raise the topic of the recruitment for MVP and since he's like um coming from marketing um we can ask them questions here as well. I want to make it happen that we're going through everything in 60 minutes so I'm time boxing a bit. Um we have time for questions in between. Um, but just let uh I'm going to push you a little bit here and that we go through every section in time. Yes, Ian.

Ian Brooks: A and I'm even going to try to be shorter than 60 minutes because unfortunately I'm double booked at uh in 27 minutes from now.

 

 

00:01:04

 

Annette MvdE: Oh, no.

Ian Brooks: So I will we go 45 minutes.

Annette MvdE: We But we recording so you can We push through.

Ian Brooks: I'll I'll I'll probably be able to stick for 45. Yeah, I'll ask fewer questions.

Annette MvdE: Yeah, we push through. Okay, let's get started. Perfect. Um so sprint review is today. Um we were able like what we want to talk today is like about the creators like the last expiration like the status we have today um and the plan for the next validation round also from the customer size expiration state and uh we plan to go even deeper like on some um gaps that we see. I want to show you the prototype that we want to use for the um validation test. we have first draft. Um, and I just want to get your feedback on some things before we just make it yeah the last pieces put putting the last pieces together and then most important like planning for next sprint because it's the last for this year. Um, we will have time in January.

 

 

00:01:56

 

Annette MvdE: Uh but still there's some stuff I want to talk to you and I will hand it over directly um to Katie for the first section of the creators.

Katheryn Eckles: Awesome. Yeah. Um, Annetta, did you want to share the screen or I can share for this bit?

Annette MvdE: I can do it.

Katheryn Eckles: Okay. Awesome. Um, so I want to start off talking very quickly about the research that we're we're doing currently and what's upcoming in terms of research. Um, so starting off with the creator research that we've been doing. Um, we have five interviews completed. Um, and we've had a a mix of sizes of creators and their backgrounds and all of that. Um, with some having like 34,000 followers up to like 1.2 million. Um, and we're pretty finding pretty consistent insights across all of them. Um, there are some slight differences like in terms of vetting expectations or compensation expectations. Um, but overall their mindsets around it and things like that are are pretty consistent. um their evaluation of the of the um concept is is is very consistent.

 

 

00:03:06

 

Katheryn Eckles: Um so uh from here we're we're going to uh kind of transition into really focusing in on those um cookbook authors and those higher um higher level kind of influencers. Um, so last week we had one who um had or actually it was Monday. Um, we had one who who was a cookbook author and chef and had a larger following. Um, and we did kind of probe a little bit deeper into like how she would work with cookbook recipes. Um, and she really saw like no conflict there in terms of like using her cookbook recipes um, and listing those as recipes on this platform. um and she really thought of it as potentially good exposure um for her cookbook. Um her cookbook was a few years old, so she thought it might be a good thing there. Um and she was pretty aligned with the compensation expectations that we'd have of it being like um a commissionbased like share of of sales. Um and uh we probed in a little bit with her about trends because that was a bit of a conversation in our last sync that we had um of like how much these influencers are kind of relying on trends.

 

 

00:04:20

 

Katheryn Eckles: And for her um she really talked about using trends only as like when they really resonate with her and when she can put her own twist on them. So, I think um continuing on with these interviews, we're going to try to probe into that a little bit more and get that better idea to see how trend reactive these folks are. Um to to see if we're just going to get a bunch of trendy recipes that need these specific ingredients or if it's going to be a a people only really hopping on these trends when it's like something that's going to be really important for them um and resonate with their audience and their content. Um then in terms of the vetting um she kind of sees this as um both HelloFresh vetting approach um there's value in HelloFresh vetting these recipes um but kind of approached her with this Amazon style um marketplace approach to see how she would kind of react to that as an option um and kind of recogni in that she recognizes that customers may not really fully understand um that HelloFresh isn't vetting those recipes um and may still blame the the marketplace um for bad recipes or the creator.

 

 

00:05:29

 

Katheryn Eckles: Um and definitely feels like we need those types of, you know, reviews and ratings and things like that to really um ensure that that things will be um at least ensure that they're they're clear on the quality of of the meals that they'll be seeing. Um and from her um she was really interested in things that we've seen from other creators as well. um data on what users are interested in like um dishes, popular ingredients, um choosing recipes based off of how long it takes to cook um and what people are searching for, things like that. And then also some some traffic data um to understand how much uh traffic she's bringing in, how much traffic there is on the site in general, things like that. Um then for next steps with these interviews, um there's we're going to be moving next week into concept validation. So we're at a point where we feel like we are getting pretty consistent insights. Um and we'll continue to kind of probe into some of the spots where we have some open questions or want a little bit more data.

 

 

00:06:32

 

Katheryn Eckles: Um, but we're gonna transition the the um interviews into focusing more on looking at some of the concepts that we have so far and getting some um deeper insights into how they see this working. It'll kind of put them into a different mindset as well when they're seeing what these this um platform will look like, what features it'll have, things like that. Um that we can get more um uh detailed uh feedback from them. Um, and so recruitment for this is is still ongoing. Um, it takes a little bit longer with with the influencers since we're emailing all of them and all of that. Um, and currently we're focusing on those larger influencers. Um, and we have the option to reach back out to a lot of the influencers that we've talked to already. They were all um, open to coming back and looking at concepts. So, if we're in a pinch and we need to reach back out to them, um, we'll be able to do that as well to at least get their eyes on and their feedback on some of the concepts now that we have them ready for them to look at.

 

 

00:07:34

 

Katheryn Eckles: Um, and so the the outcome for the concept evaluation stuff, we're going to be really hoping for some stronger indicators of desiraability of this concept now that they see it. And then also prioritizing any kind of features or must haves there um that they would would need. Um, and also hopefully, um, it'll trigger some thoughts in terms of what what is missing, what what they like, what they don't like, and and anything that might bring up any concerns or anything like that for them. Um, and then, um, Annetta will share the prototype with you, but um, I I'll open it up to some, um, questions before, uh, we move on to our next phase of research.

Ian Brooks: 100.

Katheryn Eckles: Any questions? Okay, I'll I'll move on to our next phase of research that we're going to be starting. Um, so uh we're going to focus our next phase on some uh customer interviews. Um, we already have some first signals from the unmodderated test that we've done and um, we did a quick survey. Um, and we're pretty clear on this significant inspiration execution gap um, with customers cooking behavior.

 

 

00:08:49

 

Katheryn Eckles: Um, and but we do see some gaps here still. Um, so there's a gap in understanding how they want to use this. um like what their behaviors are around um shopping for recipes online, how they're choosing influencers, things like that. But then also how would they want to use this service? Um would they see this as special occasions? What what meal occasions do they want to use it for? Um are is this something where they see themselves purchasing from this every day? Things like that. Um and then also understanding um the the focus on this like do they see value in this influencer marketplace? How can they work with this? What uh what approach do they want to have here? Do they feel like they trust these influencers? Things like that. Um and then another focus would be really on these needs and barriers. So um we've we have some understanding that we need to build and maintain trust here. Um, and with this, uh, influencers were seen as as reliable as traditional sources based off of our previous research.

 

 

00:09:58

 

Katheryn Eckles: Um, but there are still some barriers that came up in the research like um, recipe inaccuracy, um, some skepticism around like how are they making money? Are they just selling things to me? um and some fear of some social commerce scams, things like that that have really inhibited their engagement and um their their their purchase of the ingredients to make these meals. Um so for this, we'd really like to dive into trust and interest and quality needs. Um really understanding how they want to engage with this platform, what would make them feel more confident in engaging with this platform? And then also understanding their vetting expectations. Do they just automatically um assume that that we're going to be uh vetting all of these recipes? Um if we're not vetting, what would make them feel more comp confident in us not vetting these recipes? Um because from the influencer side of things, we have that assumption of what customers will feel, but we haven't actually asked them yet. So, we're going to get deep into that.

 

 

00:11:02

 

Katheryn Eckles: Um so with this um we're gonna talk with HelloFresh prospects um with the efficient inspired profile um that are actively engaging with food content on social media. Um and we're going to try to do these in 30 minute um interviews just so we can fit fit them in in and get through them pretty quickly um so we can get insights and be able to take action on those. Um and so the recruiting will start um next well starting early this week but um I'm ideally wanting some kind of pilot by the end of this week so as early as tomorrow. Um and the research focus here um again is going to kind of look at creator dynamics and cooking behavior, trust vetting and accountability and then the marketplace utility and and workflow there. really understanding how they want to how they currently save and plan and and use all these things and then how we can create tools and reminders, things like that to really help them um use this platform more efficiently. Um so again, with this phase of of the moderated testing, we're going to be doing this phased approach as we did before with the influencers.

 

 

00:12:16

 

Katheryn Eckles: So we're going to share out regular recaps at the end of each um interview day so everyone has all of the insights. Um and then based off of the learnings and feedback, we'll adapt the script um to get the insights that we need um to make sure that we're being flexible and and diving deep where where we see gaps. Okay, that was a lot of content.

Annette MvdE: Um yeah.

Katheryn Eckles: Any questions?

Annette MvdE: Yeah. Sorry. I just wanted to also ask Chay because I saw your post on Slack um where you mentioned um that you're like deep in this topic right now as a product designer for the MVP. Is there anything like on your side at the moment like big questions that you have that you really like want to probe here?

Shay Obaidullah: Yeah, I just gave over a look over the research plan and it looked like it would be very helpful for what I was working on. Also, um I saw the request was by end of day yesterday, so I didn't want to add too much, but if it's okay, I'll give it another read and see if there's anything additional.

 

 

00:13:16

 

Katheryn Eckles: Yeah, for sure. Add add in comments. Um I'm as as long as they're done by end of day today because I'm going to try to get a pilot going tomorrow.

Shay Obaidullah: Okay.

Katheryn Eckles: Um so as long as I can like incorporate those things um before that tomorrow, um I think that'd be great. Awesome.

Shay Obaidullah: Good. We'll do. Okay.

Annette MvdE: Okay. Any any other questions, concerns, um things you want to uh raise here before we are like we are so fast today. Amazing. Um Ian, you you can still give your pieces.

Ian Brooks: one one thing to slow us down. Um, why HelloFresh prospects?

Katheryn Eckles: Um so right now um we when we were looking at the unmodderated results where we did activives and prospects we um didn't see large differences in terms of um like reactions to this or differences in opinions um between those two groups. Um so thinking about trying to get this um research done efficiently, it it'll be faster for us to recruit just prospects.

 

 

00:14:25

 

Katheryn Eckles: um because of our our um base there. And if we're expecting the insights to be very similar between prospects and activives, then um we would just focus on that group. If you feel a strong um need for activives as well, we can add those in. It'll just add a little bit more time onto the timeline.

Ian Brooks: It's okay. All right. Understood. Thanks.

Annette MvdE: more practic practical reason I would say. Yes. Okay. Cool. Um concept validation prototype. I want to do a little critique here. Um we were um getting everything out from the insights that we heard so far from uh our um interviews. Um also like what we learned from the service and secondary research put them into a first flow. Um you can also like find them um on our myro board that I think is available to all of you. I will uh share the link um again if you want to. And from there we extracted like the the main pain point like the main features we want to highlight and we want to talk with the um with the creators about the critique and I want you to focus on what um is about the vision like the priorized features list that we are having in this test.

 

 

00:15:41

 

Annette MvdE: Um is something missing? Do you find like something redundant? um then the level of detail, the red flags, anything that you see also the overall story line uh flow that we um guiding this person through. I don't want to critique at the moment the copy because we are still in work in progress with Ellison uh here uh since we work very very fast on these prototypes right now. Um also I'm excluding a signup uh flow and also like setting up a storefront page because this is very complex and might come later. So this is more like we decided to not do a complete prototype because in our experience from past projects um people get distracted seeing a button I don't understand this or why what is following here. So what we're doing now is um creating a pitch deck uh where we really like just show a UI um from a specific um feature and talking with the research questions um program uh um towards the the the questions we want to answer. Um Melanie Yes,

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah, just a quick question.

 

 

00:16:47

 

Melanie Schwindt: Um, so I know in I'm probably jumping way ahead here. In 3.2, I know that you have like the import option from like video to meal kit or like from like link to meal kit. Are we talking with the team that's working on the cookbook and like sharing that development? Okay, great.

Annette MvdE: good questions. Um, this is the DAU team. Um, one of the, um, strategists in there and one of the researchers, part of my team. Um, this is why I'm also like connected with them. Uh we have also like just as that you know we have in our little um document here um a tab called other teams initiatives. So there are more teams like working on something similar that could be uh valuable uh to us. Um so at the moment I linked this to Zamir already um to talk with um um with Lisa Tupplot um that we can maybe reuse their code um also like for the other ones which Nikita uh told me some weeks back um this is why it's included here.

 

 

00:17:49

 

Annette MvdE: Yeah, and it's also part of the prototype. Okay, I've put it in here, but what I could also do is like just open Figma file and walk you through. But ah no, let's do it here for the uh I think for the recording is easier. So um we have thought about multiple ways of like bringing this person into this concept and one idea was like writing an advertising video but then uh when we graded it we were thinking okay maybe this is like it's super hard what we know and maybe Cole knows more about this um to really grade something that is like then only going to food food influencer like advertising or any like kind of real. Um, so what I was thinking is, um, I want them to the alarm clock. I want them to imagine they're scrolling through their reels because we heard from many of them that they're getting inspired by looking at other videos. They're scrolling through the reels and then they're not using a cooking video from a chef, but also seeing the CTA button of like shop a meal kit.

 

 

00:18:55

 

Annette MvdE: uh which is maybe something they haven't noticed yet like never seen this before and getting um curious about this and want to click on this and the idea is that then uh a page opens um a landing page opens from this cook um showing like their me kits their recipes that are purchasable. So when they see this, we want to probe them to click then on the for creators uh navigation bar which would open then um a landing page purely for the creators that explains very briefly like a elevator pitch the idea with the main features. This is the only screen that is still work in progress um because there's more like like from the from the content uh writing coming um to really like um yeah make this uh make this really understandable. Then we would go like uh normally like there's then a pause where we talk about like what they understood, what they liked and so on like this is um uh coming from research and then we would go into different kind of features. We would say like want to go from starting with the recipes and this might be very very simple that they understand would they like start with like group like with everything that they have already done like they have thousands of videos I don't know like they have great a cookbook would they rather start with something like existing or would they start from scratch um if they would start like from something existing we could like offer them

 

 

00:20:24

 

Annette MvdE: um uh things like importing from social media the same that the AU team is currently doing of like with the URL thing or like just uploading a file like a PDF or a document or even a video uh where we could just directly distract the information to already like fill out this me kit card of the things that we need in order to make it super easy for them. Samir make it happen. I think this is uh at the moment this might be the critical part. If they would start not from uh like if they want to start from scratch would be interesting if they even would consider to use our platform for this like if they need inspiration from maybe our analytics that we see like trending recipes or ingredients on the HelloFresh from the HelloFresh um data that we have um that they can look at or if if there are other things that they might be interested in. Um there is the question on um like how do you even start like uh with the recipes? Do you search first for ingredients?

 

 

00:21:27

 

Annette MvdE: Are there are they available in the HelloFresh assortment? They could search for example for chili pepper and see that there are types available. What kind of information is uh needed for them? We heard a lot about quality towards ingredients. My biggest question here for operation later is also like in the future how could this even work with saying like they're planning something they would add something to their recipes but the moment they publish this and make this pursuable I guess we need already like the ingredients like in the warehouse. So I'm not sure do you reserve it for a specific time frame already um for ones that are not available can you request them and so on and in the testing here we just want to find out how they think about this do they think about costs uh because like ingredients cost money and in the end this mikit will um like be cost factor and they need to make sure it's like from our experience we can give this or normally a a meal serving would cost this and this and this uh Make sure to not go crazy here.

 

 

00:22:34

 

Annette MvdE: Um, so just wanted to bring this in here. Yes, Ian.

Ian Brooks: I really like the idea. Um, I think the uh you should test what attributes of an ingredient you are going to want uh your creators to be able to select from.

Annette MvdE: Mhm.

Ian Brooks: Okay. Um, so for example, do you talk about gram weight? Do you talk about like form factor? Do you talk about um various things? Right. And I don't know between Mel or Lineia if they can give a little bit of guidance on, you know, this is what like a spec looks like for ingredients and maybe these are the three to five things that we think would translate to uh what a creator thinks about and what we could then use.

Annette MvdE: Yeah.

Ian Brooks: You know what I mean, Mel? like something from our our spec sheets or something like that that that allows somebody to say because if I see chili pepper here, do I mean a chili itself?

Annette MvdE: Heat.

Ian Brooks: Do I mean flakes?

 

 

00:23:38

 

Ian Brooks: Do I mean, you know, what volume if it's packaged?

Annette MvdE: Yeah.

Ian Brooks: What size if it's a raw ingredient?

Annette MvdE: Yeah.

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah, we'd probably need to like translate the ingredients in SPS to like what do normal people understand ingredients to be?

Linnea Siersma: Well, I think yeah, I think it should feel like a grocery store. Um, because that's like the most like I think we should start with what is the most intuitive for the creators, which will probably look like online grocery shopping and then we can always modify ours to get there.

Melanie Schwindt: I

Ian Brooks: Yeah, 100%.

Annette MvdE: Yeah.

Linnea Siersma: I wouldn't use I wouldn't use like what it looks like today.

Ian Brooks: You're right.

Linnea Siersma: Like I would I wouldn't want them to see what CPS looks like. That's for sure. Uh I would I would say like what what is the best way for them to you know grocery

Ian Brooks: But you're right. Steal Instacart's interface or steal like PC Express's interface or somebody like that as an

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah.

 

 

00:24:27

 

Annette MvdE: I was I was trying to to talk with the designers on the operation team but everybody is on vacation or not replying.

Melanie Schwindt: And I think we were talking

Annette MvdE: I'm super happy if someone like me if you you can provide me just like an understanding how it's looking today in the for the for the recipe grade and HelloFresh uh when they're creating but it sounds already looks very different

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah. And I think that it also like we started having a discussion with Jessica on pricing yesterday and I think we need to understand like what our approach is for the pricing piece. Um yeah because I I don't think we've decided on like do we actually show them like 250 per unit or 175 per unit or do we like do like a tiered pricing of like you can have x ingredients for this price and then if you want to add more it costs more. Like I think we need to understand how we approach that.

Annette MvdE: H not per me kit but more like in the amount of I want to serve five 5,000 uh from 5,000 me kits or something like that.

 

 

00:25:27

 

Annette MvdE: Um yeah interesting this good to know. Um, I was even not sure if the price would change. Like if I create a recipe like this in a draft and then look at this in three weeks and open it and see then if I would publish it now, would the price change dramatically just because of a shortage or I don't know what's going on then? Um, is this a thing to think about or would you would we still try to give them just a like a stable price all the time and then we have to cover the costs?

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah. Yeah. Like we do I think quarterly static pricing updates and so we would have to figure out how that looks for the creators. Um, and I think that's where like if we can remove some of the visibility to the creator, like I I feel like if we give the creators visibility to every skew and its cost, then we're opening ourselves up too much to them. Um, so yeah, we're trying to figure out what our strategy would be there.

 

 

00:26:20

 

Annette MvdE: Okay. Okay. Cool. Um

Linnea Siersma: We we also just like ideally the way that we're building this building this is that it the the pricing reflects the customer pricing as they're building it so that they can like feel confident in the product. But there's going to be some nuance there. Like if somebody purchases the creator recipe through and has a HelloFresh subscription, it might be cheaper versus if they don't. If they get one box, it'll be and they pay $10 of shipping on it, then that will be more expensive than if they get multiple. We probably also want to test like um some sort of like not subscription but membership where you get free shipping through the creator marketplace, which will also affect costing. So, I don't I don't know how to wrap my head around what we price the ingredients at if we want it to reflect like the customer price given that there's going to be a lot of like nuance on what that price looks like at the end in the end state.

 

 

00:27:15

 

Linnea Siersma: Maybe it's just Maybe that's not that hard. Maybe it's just the before shipping cost is what shows up here.

Annette MvdE: Yeah. Um I think for the creators is one one part but in the end I think this the test is also like towards them the customers like what that they even willing uh to pay for this or if they're willing to even subscribe to a marketplace like that. Um because there's lots of things they find or the meal people creating meal plans from dietitionian chefs or I don't know. Um this is what we want to find out also like to the customers. Yes. In.

Ian Brooks: we should consider two core pricing approaches. So there's lots of detail obviously to work through um but there's one price approach here where we charge a service fee and we let the creator set the price to the customer.

Annette MvdE: Ah. Mhm.

Ian Brooks: and there's another model and so they can set their own margin and we just charge a fulfillment fee, right?

Annette MvdE: Oh, interesting.

 

 

00:28:26

 

Ian Brooks: And there's a second model where we set the price to the consumer in some respects or it's it's effectively like cost plus with a prescribed margin to the creator and creators may be able to earn their way into

Annette MvdE: Mhm.

Ian Brooks: higher margin tiers, right? So you think about like with Uber drivers for example, a diamond driver gets a higher per kilometer payment than a new driver.

Annette MvdE: Yeah.

Ian Brooks: I know this because my father-in-law was an Uber driver for 5 years. Um and uh so we want to think about probably validating both models and or or working through them. Exactly Samir. So because you want to have incentive for people to get to higher levels to earn more, right?

Linnea Siersma: I I think that yeah I think my inclination is towards the former approach because like at the end of the day

Ian Brooks: But then also if they can price it themselves like that also like in both ways what we want is the creator should have the incentive to sell more through the platform.

Linnea Siersma: why are we doing this and it's because we're taking the piece of our business that is like a unique strength to us which is like cold chain final mile fulfillment and having like a portioned ingredients meal kit, you know, engine and we're offering that as a service just like Amazon offers like AWS as a service that makes more money now.

 

 

00:30:07

 

Linnea Siersma: So, if we're taking that piece and we're actually just charging for that piece, I think the the former model makes sense. And then to your point, Ian, like how do we encourage people to sell, the other way that we can approach that is like as you like the more successful you are on your own creator marketplace opens up the ability for your your recipes to be featured in the HelloFresh menu, which then amplifies the like the reach of those recipes, which means you can make more affiliate dollars because it ends up on our page. So that's the way I I think we manage like encouraging good work is by by having giving them more opportunities to make affiliate dollars if that makes sense. Just like you can get ads on YouTube if you get enough views, you can get, you know, put on our our main recipe page if you have enough sales.

Sameer Doda: Um I would look at it a little differently though because I would compare it to Amazon marketplace rather than AWS because we're not just offering our ops uh to these influencers.

 

 

00:31:09

 

Sameer Doda: We are actually offering them a customer base and a marketplace. So uh that that and which is why even if you look at let's look let's take a look at any product at Amazon marketplace right there are products which look almost exactly identical and sometimes are the same perform the same function but there are brands which are reputed brands which have a lot of ratings on Amazon marketplace and when then then they sell those products they charge a premium over some of the other uh some of the other sellers who are selling similar products right achieving the same outcome so in this case as as well because we will have a lot of differentiated um influencers. Some have very large followings, a lot of large fan base. They should at least have the flexibility to charge a little more than the other ones. Now, but I do also get your point of view. So maybe what we can do is that we can find middle path where we can actually have a little bit of constraint. We cannot just leave it as an open field on allowing influencers to charge whatever they want.

 

 

00:32:08

 

Sameer Doda: Instead we could have a few different uh pricing tiers where we do still do cost plus but we when we do cost plus we do a premium cost plus for these very high following influencers where you know where we let's say charge cost plus I don't know 80%, for medium tier we charge cost plus 50%, and for influencers with very small followings we do cost plus 30%. So that is still a way to differentiate between different levels of these influencers while still a giving these um influencers some incentive to kind of increase their reach and b maybe also giving them alternative parts on how they can get to that premium tier even if they do not increase their reach on their own influencer platforms. If they are able to somehow sell more on HelloFresh that could be another path for them to reach that premium tier within the HelloFresh marketplace.

Cole Banning: I was just going to say like to me the reason to increase your reach is just we have a model that pays out money and you sell more and then you make more money.

 

 

00:33:06

 

Cole Banning: Like the extra complexity for me it feels like it's creating complexity when you don't need it. It's like I want to we have set up a model where they are paid sufficiently if they sell 10 but now they want to sell 100 because they will make more money. And I also think them being able to set their own margins is important because yeah, a top tier influencer should show I don't know like Gordon Ramsay should come in with a high margin product. That's what he would want. Um and for us to like involve ourselves. It's the same like it's Amazon. If you put a a product on Amazon marketplace, you set your own price, you set your own margin, and then you win or lose, and you scale based on the economics of the product that you've put on there.

Ian Brooks: all of this. Yeah, I think I think if if I were to try to synthesize in the uh interest of moving here, um I think that we probably need to so we need to take an action from the Canada side to build these out with numbers.

 

 

00:34:12

 

Ian Brooks: Um, and then from the product and development side, I think we probably need to build for flexibility right now. I don't know. Annette, what do you think?

Annette MvdE: I just wonder like I think I put this already like in a select channel um last last time. Uh if most of the problems will like solve themselves over time. The same what Cole me means with the marketplace in Amazon. If you put a very high price on your M kit, this is like the double of what others give people buy it or know. um they will comment it um to say like this is very expensive, this is not worth the price and then this person has a problem. Um if the quality is s***, people will not buy it, bad ratings, they not make money the moment they not making money like it's not working for them anymore. Um, so I see it more like that the system clears itself but giving them the option to do whatever they want. And in the end like the recipe from my opinion is not worth anything.

 

 

00:35:24

 

Annette MvdE: It's all about the person behind that like makes the marketing like shows them everywhere and people are excited about this person and this is why they want to buy it in the end. um and less about what we have as uh like solving a problem for people who are having a like this mental load issue and saying like I just want not to think about this and like getting great recipes each week. Um it's just like a I think like a different perspective here from the people coming from these influences.

Katheryn Eckles: Um, with all of this pricing stuff, would it be helpful um to query our uh creators that we're talking to about some of these potential models? um or is this something that we don't really care about the influencer like p perspective on this or is this something where it's like if we pose maybe a few models or um get their expectations around the pricing structure um would that be helpful Oh,

Ian Brooks: I think we don't. If you go and ask 10 influencers how much money they want to earn, their answer is just going to be as much as possible.

 

 

00:36:42

 

Ian Brooks: I think it's on us to create something that aligns their incentives with ours. And then over time, and it's going to have to start out with they're getting 80%, we're getting 20. And when we get bigger, the pie will get bigger, but also our share of the pie will get bigger. But like all of these things, the platform has to have scale before the owner of the platform can greedily grab all the money.

Katheryn Eckles: for sure. Okay, I I won't probe too much on it then with influencers then and and then if we do see a need for it though at any point, just let me know and we can kind of pivot

Ian Brooks: Yeah. Okay.

Annette MvdE: moving on quickly. Um the last part here is just to show them that there is still like when they start from scratch and not having a video or anything, there is work to do and they have a lot of they have already a lot on their plate with the video editing um what they're currently doing. So just showing them that there might be like work to do things to make this recipe really accurate in a specific format that we want from them.

 

 

00:37:52

 

Annette MvdE: Um just to see like their reactions. Yeah, Melanie.

Melanie Schwindt: Um, quick question. So, on both the um cookbook as well as like if they're making something from scratch, um, and this might be more of a question for Canada. Um, do we envision having recipe cards? Cuz I would say like that's not something currently that is a function in the cookbook. Um, and then like that would be something that like do we use Concord to translate the recipe instructions into recipe cards? Do we pivot to fully digital recipe cards with like videos? Like because there will be videos like I'm not sure what the So maybe this is more just like a question for Canada and we could talk about it. We're we're going to do a working session on Monday. Um

Annette MvdE: Yeah. Okay. Um this was also like something I think we talked about this as well when we heard from some influencers saying like um is this even branded for me? like there might be interest in um having something like printed out where it's just a little bit different template um and then the name of the influencer.

 

 

00:38:59

 

Annette MvdE: Uh if this is like um we could also like yeah see if this uh is in the end like we just need to circle back to the digital world and I will show you in a minute what I mean by that. Um so one thing that we only wanted to uh put our fingers in is the quality assurance. Um like uh the level of security the creators will need. We heard already like that they want to make sure because they doing recipes they know how to do it but they don't know how to make me kids. This is a new area for them. So making sure like giving them something in order that they are assured that this is like that that everything is fine. Um we wanted to make this um in form of maybe AI or whatever you can do to just um when they finished the recipes that they can get a fast um reply on um you have a double ingredient here or there's um in the instruction uh some kind of tips that we can give them that are very easy to understand step by step kind of thing.

 

 

00:40:03

 

Annette MvdE: anything we could give them. And on the other side, um talking about this vetted uh piece of that real chefs from HelloFresh would look at the recipes or even I don't know cook them. Um this depends also like on our capacity and on the money that would cost us. Yeah.

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah, I think the the like vetted by HelloFresh would be like definitely something we should explore and like figure out what that looks like. I think that could be another like piece of like once you are a like top creator in our marketplace then like you can request or like we could potentially just like choose to vet certain things which then would also then give them more credibility. But like I think it's kind of that like incentive wheel of once they sell more and they're putting out more then like we can bet them so that they can make even more. So like it's another premium offering of it.

Annette MvdE: Okay. Yeah. Um and then managing the MI kits um offering um that they have that they can do more.

 

 

00:41:05

 

Annette MvdE: Ian, you want to say for the last thing something?

Ian Brooks: Yeah, just on the vetting to be honest, I think that's something that in time a creator will need to pay for.

Annette MvdE: Yeah. Yeah, I think yeah,

Ian Brooks: That is a service that they can buy from us and we need a great name for it. place like you can fresh, you can cheffify it, you can something like that. All right, so just let's just put our creative hats on there at some point in time.

Annette MvdE: maybe even like the I mean a lot of the bigger ones or the chefs that already made their name. I don't think they need this uh so much, but maybe the smaller ones might need this more and they might buy something like this as a service to like to become bigger. Um because Yeah.

Ian Brooks: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. And the idea here is that you're testing, you're paying us to validate to test that the Exactly. that the recipe works for the meal kit format.

 

 

00:42:07

 

Annette MvdE: Yeah. So the managing part is um as I said like make more out of your content. So you create maybe a recipe but you could also use this recipe and creating a menu with adding a dessert recipe. Um you could create a meal plan um for people who want to um um order already like a big box from us for the whole week. Um so giving them opportunities and understanding a little bit is this even a thing. Do you create meal plans? is do you create menus or do you concentrate mostly on small um easy to prep u recipes? Um also like the um watch your revenue grow and how your meals perform like understand like what is what are they interested in? We heard already like platform traffic um trends um and analysis pieces on the platform but also like maybe how how their recipes are performing um of course like their sales um in the past week, month, whatever. Um just understand a little bit more like what is really needed and what is nice to have and what is missing for them.

 

 

00:43:13

 

Annette MvdE: Um I was also not sure like talking to Zamir if we would even consider like starting with Shopify in the beginning from technical environment because they have a lot of analytics but this would be way too overwhelming for most people. Um so really understanding like the the top tier analytics tools that they need um and not just nice to have is like yeah helpful. Yes, no problem Ian. And the last piece was the engagement part um like going into and saying like okay you can now engage with people who actually cook your meals because on social media I mean everybody is commenting everybody is liking or disliking but you never know like who this was and the idea is a little bit um that everybody can explore the marketplace but when you cook like when you buy something you you are able to create very fast an account like through Google or Apple whatever um and then you are able able to um to get more content um to comment uh uh u um uh communicate maybe with the influencer if they want to.

 

 

00:44:19

 

Annette MvdE: Maybe even like there was an idea of like that the community is uh rating or like there's a poll happening where they can modify the recipe that this creator created and say like can we even swap specific things and then the creator can like create a second mit or what we do in HelloFresh already that the people can decide I don't want chicken I want uh beef instead for example. Um also like to provide more content. Yes, they will have already like a lot on their plate and the res like the videos they have would fit perfectly in our HelloFresh world where we could use even as step-by-step video where we can jump um uh on on the video uh like on a specific video step. Um, I was just thinking if there's interest on more content to create like tips and tricks, uh, cooking trips, uh, even like how to use a knife, whatever, like everything. Um, to like to make this commu, like to build up this community. um or even like creating this live cooking events of saying like you can buy my bo my meal kit and in two weeks there's this uh event happening where we cook together online uh and I share my tricks and tips with you um the same our grandmas did on TV back then I remember just a little bit more convenient and the last piece is just showing them like that this is a whole circle for the uh

 

 

00:45:42

 

Annette MvdE: for their audience by having it like when they discover it online on their social media accounts uh clicking on a link seeing the MI kit purchasing uh the MI kit um it gets delivered to your home depending on MI kit card or not that there is like maybe with a QR code that they're going back to the content um having live sessions or other things that they can enjoy. We also heard that um it's like my concern is a little bit that the creator might think ah then my audience is only spending time on the marketplace and not on the not commenting anymore on social media. But I think for from what we heard it doesn't matter so much because most people even saving the recipes and not liking or commenting at all. So seeing like now people really like cooking them because it's super easy might be even like super enjoyable for them. I put the link for the Figma file in here as well. You can also leave comment there or just uh click on the image and then you can uh leave a comment if you feel there's something missing or um you see a red flag.

 

 

00:46:48

 

Annette MvdE: Yes, Melanie

Melanie Schwindt: I think that's definitely like the piece on like are they going to be commenting in the marketplace versus on like the actual post itself. I think that's less of an issue for Canada because we don't have a creator platform. Um so like in the US I know like creators do get paid based off of engagement on this like on Tik Tok or on Instagram I or maybe not Instagram but on Tik Tok for sure. Um, but in Canada they don't. And so I think it's less of a barrier in Canada.

Annette MvdE: But maybe then later for the bigger market internationally. Yeah. Yeah. Good point.

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah. So it'd be probably something to flag more for like the US than for Canada. Actually, I don't know if it's I don't know if the US is the only market that has a Tik Tok creator platform or if there's other that do.

Annette MvdE: Uh yeah, I only saw like that the shop, the Tik Tok shop for example is not available in Canada but only like in a very like I think US and some other countries.

 

 

00:47:43

 

Annette MvdE: Um because I ah yeah

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah, Tik Tok shop isn't, but I know like Amazon storefront is available in Canada. So, like I think that this is very doable via like Amazon storefront, but yeah, we don't have Tik Tok shop.

Sameer Doda: I think on the on that last piece though on them commenting back, I think that is probably going to be one of the most interesting things for the influencers as well. And so they might actually ask us on what are the things that we can potentially do to increase that that interaction and you know maybe you know the ways in which we can nudge our customers uh if they've purchased a recipe to come back and provide some form of comment feedback which uh you know depending upon which market uh it might be ideal for them to actually go back and do it on the original content itself and that's what the influencers might prefer. And that kind of goes back to what have we been able to do so far to get feedback from our customers on our own HelloFresh platform for previous week recipes.

 

 

00:48:47

 

Sameer Doda: We can look into some of the ideas that work there, but I definitely think that we need more

Annette MvdE: Yes. Yes. Yeah. As I said like if you feel there's a very important topic that we haven't catched here or um or we need to create something new just let me know. Uh we try to um go through the UX writing tomorrow and on Monday um to make sure everything is there and uh yeah is testable for that. Um this was also like a question that I just put in here for Melanie. Uh I was also like wondering during the testing if it would be even possible to make a live calculation for them with uh the creator on like what's the possible revenue stream like depending on the audience size. But I guess this is for later when um trying to get them on the platform um to like with a contract with everything.

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah, I think that's like a Yeah, and I think that's going to like change over time as well.

Annette MvdE: Yeah.

 

 

00:49:44

 

Melanie Schwindt: So, like we're probably going to treat the first couple of influencers or whoever differently. Um, and then I think it'll depend on like potentially for like really big partnerships, we might have a completely different model than like people who are just signing up. And then I think similar to like YouTube, like I would probably say like 90% of people who post YouTube videos never make any money. Um, but like 10% of people make a lot of money. Like it's kind of a like I don't know that we want to promise people like, "Oh, if you upload 10 recipes, you'll for sure make $100 because you might make zero."

Annette MvdE: Yeah, true.

Melanie Schwindt: Um, and so I think that's like where our model becomes successful is that we don't promise that they're going to make any money.

Annette MvdE: Yeah. Yeah.

Linnea Siersma: Um, just one thing I I don't know if everybody covered this, but are we planning on sending these different like you I don't know the right word for this cuz I'm not in tech, but like are we planning on sending versions of this to creators like to people to click through both from a customer standpoint and a creator standpoint to like test out different concepts and see if there's fit?

 

 

00:50:50

 

Linnea Siersma: Is that the plan with these

Annette MvdE: Uh so with with these this is just for the creators um just because um we're doing the the insights interviews with the with the customers but uh we had to decide at some point like what is the most important flow and from the customer side like the the flow of like purchasing from social media is not something super new. This is already like well known at some point. We also have a lot of data from HelloFresh site. So we were saying like influencer is completely new. We really want to like show them the concept like showing them some screens from the time that we have and like push more in this direction and the rest will uh come with the experiments like in the first MVP stream running. So this was for the for the for this you talking about this prototype here, right?

Linnea Siersma: And then are we going to do like multiple versions that we send out to see which one is like stickiest or are we just sending what's the plan for that testing?

 

 

00:51:44

 

Linnea Siersma: for the creator. Yeah, exactly.

Annette MvdE: Yeah. So what we're doing is like having all of these features and then understanding afterwards that the we're not sure if we're doing card sorting exercise with them just to see like what is the main main important features for the vision later and what is the musthaves for the MVP right Oh,

Linnea Siersma: Yeah, I'm a little nervous that we're moving quickly towards like building before establishing like fit. And so I know there's like I don't know as much about this world, but I would I would rather create like fake multiple fake versions of this website.

Annette MvdE: Mhm.

Linnea Siersma: I know there's companies that do this where they can create like prototype that um and send them out and like see what's stickiest before like I go down the path of taking a picture of every ingredient and price and loading it in. Like I feel like it's a little premature for development um before we really like establish fit.

Annette MvdE: Yes.

Linnea Siersma: and like things that I'm not sure about is like what level of detail is like the best for creators, what is the best like what you know all those different things because if it turns out that like no one wants to build a recipe on this then that just that changes the direction of the work quite a lot and I'm worried that like we're already building stuff and we haven't actually established that it will be successful.

 

 

00:53:07

 

Annette MvdE: Uh, Kitty

Katheryn Eckles: I just want to add a little comment. I think a lot of the things that Anetta has designed here are off of feedback that we've gotten from the creators initially. So, we came in kind of with like what were what are your expectations of this this marketplace? How would this function? What would you expect in terms of features? How would you expect to manage like um ingredients and things like that? And then those insights were used to kind of inform these designs. So, I think that's the approach that we've taken so far. And Anetta, you can speak more to it, but I just wanted to call in that like that this isn't just us like having an idea and designing something off of that, but it's designed off of the insights that

Annette MvdE: Sure.

Katheryn Eckles: we're finding from the creators specifically.

Linnea Siersma: totally. It's just it's just a it's just a it's just the interviews but not necessarily like mass testing just usability what it actually feels like.

 

 

00:53:59

 

Linnea Siersma: So, I just I'm a little bit It would be great to be able to like quickly pivot and try different versions. What I'm worried about is like pigeon hole ourselves into an idea that isn't quite right and then we like do all this work next year and it's like, "Oh s***, this wasn't exactly what we wanted.

Annette MvdE: No, no, no. I get those. So there you can like of course we like we are now in the company in a phase where we're doing a little bit different approach from ways of working. We did this normally in the past with DXS doing six months of really like deep analysis and interviews and uh insights creation to really understand what what we're building but even then creating something experimenting with a smaller group. This is why we're doing this in Canada with a smaller amount of people to understand is this really successful or do we hold and or pivot completely. Um and here it's just like to really understand like what are the things that they really desire here to understand even in which direction the MVP would run.

 

 

00:54:57

 

Linnea Siersma: Yeah.

Annette MvdE: Um and there might be opportunities to always do like smoke testing on social media. um understanding like what a customer even more interested in something like this or that then we have some kind of ABC testing depending on the resources that we are getting um at the moment for us was told like

Linnea Siersma: Yeah.

Annette MvdE: the project is ending at some point end of January February and then depending on how the experiment is going forward but I'm sure like we couldn't even think of something like how to experiment this even further like with Katie together like on the research side to give you something in your hand like to say like okay we don't want to run like super blind and just put all our eggs into one basket. Can we even do like an experiment for this and this and that um and include uh the research. My just concern at the moment is at the moment the company's direction is more hands-on experiment rather than explore very deep um what I yeah but this is always the case.

 

 

00:55:52

 

Linnea Siersma: Yeah, I think that's what's giving me a little bit of heartburn. Like what if no one likes it, you know? Like I don't know if we necessarily it's not it's not a um it's not a small investment from our side locally in terms of cost and resources.

Annette MvdE: This is always with the MVPs. Um, this is why we start small and then build it up and learn from the experiments.

Linnea Siersma: And so like it would be interesting to see how this stacks up against other things that we could be doing. Um and so like if there's a way to actually quantify how much it's resonating for with both customers and and creators through like smoke tests and like quickly like stuff that doesn't work but at least gauges interest. I think an investment in that area is more helpful than necessarily like building out a fully functional prototype at this point.

Annette MvdE: Yeah, let me get this um also to Andrea and to Mark um to see what we can do here. like if we can blend something out that you can that we can do or if the Ian and everybody decided no we're not doing this that we still have like some options here like for your fears um that we can see yeah let me let me get this we are only having one minute left and I still wanted to talk about something um very briefly and this is why Cole is in the call as well so

 

 

00:57:08

 

Annette MvdE: on our side for the final sprint because it's already like end of year and then this Christmas holiday coming Um Samir we talked uh about their uh design and tech like current status. We are planning on uh finishing uh the research part here with the concept test. Um also like to give the team the recommendations but also like as we heard staying as a consultancy the partner over time because we learned a lot and we can still like um give feedback on on many steps here. Um but also like my biggest concern since some weeks and I put this in a channel but I'm not sure if everybody saw it um is this how to recruit u for the MVP now like we need to start at some point figure out who to who to reach out. I talked to Marina Kramma some weeks back and she also mentioned that we have already relationships with chefs um that we worked in the past with that might be able to recruit them for this uh experiment um with a bigger name um but really understanding I think we need legal for contracts creation and this might take some time I just wanted to point it out because I'm not sure who would be driving this topic is this the MVP squad is it someone from uh operation and business side.

 

 

00:58:23

 

Annette MvdE: Um, yeah. Cool.

Cole Banning: Um, my gut is Ian needs to answer this question and he's not here.

Annette MvdE: Ah, okay.

Cole Banning: I just like I'm it could be me and my team, but I'm not in a position to commit that without direction from someone senior to me. Um we will do like minor things like Annette we've already kind of flagged of like little tests on the HelloFresh um menu working with Lineia that are like pretests and maybe some of those people might be interested in

Annette MvdE: Okay.

Cole Banning: migrating to this program like they we did something with them as an influencer putting something on the hellish menu and then we tell them about marketplace and they want to try it. But in terms of like the real question you're asking, which is who's owning all of these influencers that we want to get onto the platform and test with and deal with legal and deal with their issues and all of those questions? I don't know. I think Ian has to answer that and then

Annette MvdE: Okay, Melanie or Lineia, can you bring this to Ian because I think you're too Thank you so much for that.

 

 

00:59:29

 

Annette MvdE: And on the operation and viability side, um I'm also not quite sure what what is happening. I I hear you doing a lot of workshops and so in the in the background because we're having the Yeah, we are just working on the other side of the world. Um I was just curious to hear what you are doing right now like with the business case and uh on operation side.

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah, just like seeing as we're over time, I'll give a 30 second summary.

Annette MvdE: Yeah.

Melanie Schwindt: Um, so we connected with our operations team for the MVP. We have a plan for how we're going to fulfill the boxes. Um, at a high level. Um, we're going to do it in a pretty scrappy way to start. Um, and I think there's like a decent question mark around kind of like what the tech actually looks like and what the offering actually looks like. Um, that will help like inform some of these decisions. Um, yeah, we're going to meet um as a Canada team on Monday to go through like more of a like kind of strategy brainstorming session so that it can help inform some of those decisions as to like where

 

 

01:00:29

 

Annette MvdE: Amazing.

Melanie Schwindt: we're going on pricing, where we're going on creator onboarding, all of those pieces. So, um, we're connecting Monday to hopefully have a little bit more on that front.

Annette MvdE: Um, is there any um like specifically um I'm not sure if we want to maybe adding this to our test with the influencers. Um, if they want to have a try run like understanding how is this even looking like when I create this MI kit, do I get a test at home? This is even possible from your side um that they test the service before they uh commit or like start publishing their recipes.

Melanie Schwindt: they could buy one of their own meals. I think it depends like like it's a yes for every option. I think it just like depends on what we're trying to do.

Annette MvdE: Yeah.

Melanie Schwindt: Um yeah, like I think if they want to buy the kit to then make at home like we can figure that out. I think it just like do we offer that for everybody or do we only offer that for some people?

 

 

01:01:28

 

Melanie Schwindt: Because if we offer it for everyone, we're kind of just sending everyone free food.

Annette MvdE: for once.

Melanie Schwindt: Um, yeah.

Annette MvdE: No, no, that's that's for sure. No, that's that makes sense. Um, just wonder like if like also I mean it's a fulfillment ask like just doing one one box off again and stuff like that. Okay, good. Um, yeah.

Linnea Siersma: I guess like we're we're kind of feeling a little bit confused as to like we don't want to because this is like your project. We don't want to like overstep. There's a lot of ops work to do. There's some of this like marketing recruitment piece to do. How do we want to like stay connected through this? Because I'm kind of like toggling between like waiting and seeing what's coming next versus being like, "All right guys, like I need a weekly everybody in a room like boots on the ground. Let's

Annette MvdE: Yeah.

Linnea Siersma: get going on this." And

Annette MvdE: Well, I got

Linnea Siersma: we haven't really jumped into that on our side because we I think we're just like I know you did a great job presenting like the Daisy in our original meeting, but I'm un I don't I don't know if I actually totally understand who's driving all these different pieces and how much everyone needs to be involved.

 

 

01:02:29

 

Linnea Siersma: Maybe that's not me. Maybe I should have read the DC, but you know, like do you want do you want if Mal and I like are starting to set up steering meetings around this project, do you want to lead them, attend them, be aware of them?

Annette MvdE: This is a good question because like at the moment like as I said like these kind of projects how like this is the first time the project is like that just saying um we normally like worked in a squad of shift strategists and researchers um creating all this and then connecting with tech to see is this even feasible can we operate something like that and getting business into to calculate everything and then we would bring this to like higher management and say like yes go or no go for experimentation and then we were off. Um so this time it's a little bit different. This is why I asked I think in the kickoff back then who's going to be driving specific things because I can't do everything being one person and Katie as a researcher.

 

 

01:03:25

 

Annette MvdE: So this is why we are owning at the moment just the strategy side and having then on a tech side like Wonderly and Samir uh operationly was and business was at the moment like back then Melanie um to have them driving these pieces completely individual um because yeah as I said like I'm not an expert in this um I'm also having troubles with the time zones but if you feel um there's anything you need from my side as well like that I need to be included it um tell me I try to make it happen but I'm not sure if I would be the right person here as well because like I'm not an expert in there I can only talk about maybe strategy design and Katie on the research side what we heard so far so that's my Yeah.

Linnea Siersma: Okay. So then why don't why don't we just like go with like why don't we just move forward at the pace we feel like is appropriate for a Q2 test and we will let you know what's up and you just tell us if you feel like you'd want to be more involved or less involved but we'll we'll just Mel and I will just kind of go like full steam from here on and keep you in the loop and you let us know if we've overstepped but I think we're kind of like tippy toeing a little bit and that's causing us to slow down and I didn't know if that was a real problem or a fake

 

 

01:04:32

 

Annette MvdE: No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

Linnea Siersma: problem I made up.

Annette MvdE: Not a problem at all. I think this is the new way of working.

Linnea Siersma: Okay.

Annette MvdE: Everybody has just run and make it happen. This is at the moment.

Linnea Siersma: Awesome.

Annette MvdE: I think the thing and I really like it's not my project. It's just like Mark came to me and said like, "Hey, you can do it." I was like, "Whoa."

Linnea Siersma: Yeah. And we were we were kind of told like, okay, global is leading this and like we need to contribute.

Annette MvdE: What? No. Ah, yeah.

Linnea Siersma: And so I think like that initial that conversation set us off on a point where we're like, okay, like okay, we'll wait for direction.

Annette MvdE: Yeah.

Linnea Siersma: But now I think it's becoming more apparent for me especially that I have to like do some work here.

Annette MvdE: Yeah. But not good feedback. No, this is this is great feedback because I think this is the biggest issue specifically teams.

 

 

01:05:13

 

Linnea Siersma: So yeah.

Annette MvdE: We never work together. time zone issues. We're working on completely different continents and I only have one hour overlap with Katie for example every second day. So we have a lot of travels already.

Linnea Siersma: Yeah.

Annette MvdE: But this is what I mean like please run alone what you need from us. Yes. But on the other hand it's your project in the end. It's Ian's baby and German's baby. So I hope just that we are helping to inform the MVP like the MVP squad would have run anyway.

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah.

Annette MvdE: doesn't matter what we had had figured out. We only wanted to make sure that we do something and inform a little bit that they are not running completely against the wall. And this was this was more like where I was coming from.

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah.

Annette MvdE: Yeah.

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah. And maybe just to provide like a little bit of context as to so like for Canada, we're going to do like more of a strategy working session on like the vision.

 

 

01:06:09

 

Annette MvdE: Okay.

Melanie Schwindt: um which might have some things coming out of that that we actually like would love for your team to help support researching into more specific topics.

Annette MvdE: Yes.

Melanie Schwindt: Um and so that was kind of where we were like do we ask them to do it?

Annette MvdE: Yes.

Melanie Schwindt: Do we just ask our own team to do research? We were like what do we do?

Annette MvdE: could also be I mean we can talk about because in the end my my director which is Mark has to decide because he decides where I'm working with like do I go back to product design job and helping

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah. Yeah.

Annette MvdE: at the moment like loyalty team next like there for me this is at the moment clear but I think this is a good conversation if you're saying like we're starting something like this and then we can talk I

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah.

Annette MvdE: can talk to to Mark or Andrea who's the lead on the research side to figure out like what are what planned for us because we have not much control about that at the moment and uh how can we

 

 

01:06:55

 

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah.

Annette MvdE: help you uh on the right forward? Yes, Katie.

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah. And then I think involving like tech into that as well as to like when do we like to Lia's point earlier, when do we start telling them to build something and like how confident are we that like we're

Annette MvdE: Yes.

Melanie Schwindt: ready to build that thing or is it going to change?

Annette MvdE: Yeah. But at the moment I mean the tech team is already starting right like they are investigating in the back end um looking like Zamir and Nikita and Warly they're looking into like how to start something like let's just

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah.

Annette MvdE: put the MVP for the first MVPs and then I think they have some time for the iterations on whatever we learn and because we have a path forward with the vision of saying okay now we include this feature and see what happens now we get more control and then we see what happens.

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah.

Annette MvdE: So this is like incremental testing, adding a little feature again and make people happy and testing um the way forward.

 

 

01:07:49

 

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah. And I think it would just be great to like make sure we're all on the same page about like what are we where are we starting with the tech and like what is going to be delivered when I

Annette MvdE: Yeah. Yeah.

Melanie Schwindt: think is probably helpful to then like if we need to reshape our ops or reshape our strategy we're like all on the same page about that.

Annette MvdE: Yes. This good. Yeah.

Melanie Schwindt: Yeah.

Annette MvdE: Um normally what what we most of the time did and this is I have a meeting with Nikita he's back from parental leave um because I talked with SI a little bit about this to ask like what do you want from us in the end like is it just recommendations is it more um is it screens anything like normally after this project we would recommendations but we did did with the tech teams together like eye score for example to understand like what is the the most important features from MVP to vision um how is it. Yeah.

 

 

01:08:38

 

Annette MvdE: How are the incremental MVPs in between um the the major plan actually like for everything and I think we have like after the next interviews we have more uh insights around this that we can build this plan together with tech. Uh but tech has to like inform us about like is it even feasible? What can we do? When can we do it? Um and we can only like recommend what is highest desired what is less desired. Um and then I guess like business like the business perspective comes in here as well for this plan. Yes.

Katheryn Eckles: Yeah. Um, I just want to jump in and say, um, with like upcoming research, especially as you're kind of like getting clear on like your strategy and the questions that kind of come up there, um, there might be like often we make like prioritization decisions and things like that based off of like how much work is needed in a space. So, if you guys become clear on like, oh, we need testing on all of these things, we need clarity on this, that, and this.

 

 

01:09:36

 

Katheryn Eckles: um we're going in this direction and we have no idea in terms of research. There might also be things where maybe Anetta is done with the strategy bits of things, but I stay on as the researcher helping you research these things for a little bit longer. So there's there's things that might happen in that context as well. Um where we can potentially still support, but I think a lot of the decisions on our team tend to be made based off of like um the clear need in in that space. So, um, if if you kind of have your strategy decisions and you're communicating with us of like, okay, this is where we're going, and then we can inform you, okay, we don't have, you know, clarity on these parts, those parts, and those parts. Do you want research on that? And then we can work together and kind of figure out what um kind of research is needed. And then we can bring that to Mark and and Andrea and and try to advocate for me staying on a little bit longer to help um kind of derisk this.

Annette MvdE: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

Katheryn Eckles: So,
