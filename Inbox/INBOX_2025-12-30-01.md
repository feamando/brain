### DOC: Getting Started with Claude Code CLI
ID: 1mUhFmfAeQD7gOCZR60Rfdot4gNzcmWX_CyYt6iosD9I
Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUhFmfAeQD7gOCZR60Rfdot4gNzcmWX_CyYt6iosD9I/edit?usp=drivesdk
----------------------------------------

﻿Getting Started with Claude Code CLI¶

If you prefer to use AI in your terminal, Claude Code CLI is one of the recommended tools for you. We don't provide paid licenses for Claude Code CLI to use their model directly. You are only allowed to use Claude Code CLI with AWS Bedrock models provided by HelloFresh.

Pre-Requisites¶

* Access to AWS Bedrock account (bedrock1). Here you can find the instructions on how to get access.

* AWS CLI installed. To install AWS CLI, follow the instructions.

* Basic knowledge of using the command line.

Installation¶

Follow the official documentation provided by Claude Code to install and configure Claude Code CLI. You can follow the recommended steps below to install Claude Code CLI in order to use HelloFresh provided AWS Bedrock models.

Step 1: Install Claude Code CLI¶

Follow the official installation instructions from Claude to install the CLI. After installation, you can run claude --version to check if the installation was successful. It would return the version of the Claude Code.

Step 2: Configure AWS Credentials¶

There are multiple ways to configure AWS credentials. You can follow the official documentation to configure your AWS credentials from Claude Code documentation.

However, we prefer to setup a SSO profile for AWS for making it easy to re-authenticate when needed.

To setup SSO profile,

1. Make sure you have $HOME/.aws/config file exists.

2. Add the following AWS Bedrock SSO profile to the $HOME/.aws/config file for accessing bedrock1 AWS Bedrock account.

# existing profiles





[profile sso-bedrock]

sso_start_url = https://hfsso.awsapps.com/start

sso_region = eu-west-1

sso_account_id = 951719175506

sso_role_name = bedrock-user

region = eu-west-1





	3. 

Verify that the profile is working by running aws sso login --profile sso-bedrock. After successful login, run aws sts get-caller-identity --profile sso-bedrock to verify that you are able to access AWS Bedrock account.

Step 3: Configure Claude Code CLI to use AWS Bedrock models¶

   1. Make sure you have $HOME/.claude/settings.json file exists. If not, create this file.

   2. Add the following configuration to the $HOME/.claude/settings.json file.

{

    "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-settings.json",

    "awsAuthRefresh": "aws sso login --profile sso-bedrock",

    "env": {

      "AWS_PROFILE": "sso-bedrock",

      "AWS_REGION": "eu-west-1",

      "CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK": "1",

      "ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "eu.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0"

    }

}





	Important

   * Your model ID must be adjusted if you use different region. For example, eu.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0 is for eu-west-1 region.

   * You can find the list of available models here.

Step 4: Test your installation¶

Open your terminal and run claude "HI" to see Claude Code CLI in action. If it responds with an answer, you are ready to use Claude Code CLI. You would see it in action like the below:



Congratulations! Start building.

Note

If you have any questions, please reach out to the #clan-genai or the #squad-engineering-productivity.

FAQ¶

   * Do I need to login to Claude Code CLI to use it?

No. Because we don't provide paid licenses for Claude Code CLI to use their model directly. Instead, we use AWS Bedrock models provided by HelloFresh. Therefore, you don't need to login to Claude Code CLI to use it. Also, you are not allowed to use Claude Code CLI with your personal licenses.

      * Can I use any other model with Claude Code CLI?

Yes, you can use any models that are available in AWS Bedrock in "bedrock1" AWS Bedrock account. You can find the list of available models here.

         * I see errors "Too many requests" or related to rate limiting errors when I run Claude Code CLI. What should I do?

It's a known issue mostly happen due to the rate limiting of AWS Bedrock models. Please try again later. We continuously monitor quotas of AWS Bedrock models and will request the quota if needed to AWS. If you still see the issue, please reach out to the #clan-genai or the #squad-engineering-productivity.

﻿Dear Team, 





Closing out 2025, one has to reflect back and, in doing so, agre that we’re closing 2025 in style! This has been a banging year with us delivering bigger and more impactful things faster than ever before, with many of you working directly on Factor Programs, ABBA, Cross-Selling, Mealkit Handovers, Accessibility Improvements and Occasion Boxes for HelloFresh; while driving our brands to new heights and expanding the TAM (wink!) for The Pets Table, Good Chop and Factor Form! While this year had some hiccups along the way (Wallet migration - looking at you!) and turbulence and transition - your ability to dive into any topic, your readiness to help your colleagues and friends out day and night; your empathy and support allowed you to weather the stormy waters and have some fun while doing it. You lot are absolute legends! 



Going into 2026 we have a strong Yearly Plan, we have cool projects and we have the right ambition for next year to be a pivotal for HelloFresh Group and, we have the right team in place to get all of it done. With our new team structure, bringing greater focus on our brands, clearer reporting and stakeholder lines and greater freedom to make design, experience, product and engineering decisions we are certain that we will rock it in the coming year and we’re set to deliver some huge wins already in the first weeks of January. 



Get some days of rest, recharge, enjoy the winter weather (as much as possible) and connect with your family, friends and loved ones. I wish you all a brilliant coming new year where your ambitions are always matched by your successes and some luck along the way. 





Happy New Year and HUGE Thank you - we would be nowhere without each and every one of you!



Daniel & Nikita

VMS OTP UAT - Part 2

Invited Nikita Gorshkov Emily Mendelson Michael James Clarke Hamed Karimian Edwin Torres Tavi Scandiff-Pirvu

Attachments VMS OTP UAT - Part 2 UAT | One Time Purchase VMS 

Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Edwin Torres reviewed previous bug findings and confirmed that high-priority issues were addressed, while also outlining the objective to re-review One-Time Purchase (OTP) scenarios and test cases, including monitoring events generated on staging. Edwin Torres and Nikita Gorshkov planned to open a support ticket with the Katana group concerning event rollout issues, and Edwin Torres, Hamed Karimian, and Michael James Clarke discussed and prioritized several bugs, including a critical issue breaking the dashboard bundles section, a shipping fee discrepancy for OTP, and a problem with price reflection when changing item frequency or quantity. Hamed Karimian confirmed that four high-priority tickets need resolution, including the contradictory price communication and the subscription discount communication, and that the Katana issue must be solved before deployment to live.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Review of Previous Findings and Prioritization Edwin Torres opened the session by reviewing bug issues and tickets created from previous findings, confirming that high, medium, and low priority issues were addressed, with emphasis on fixing high priority ones (00:00:00). The main objective of the current session is to re-review different scenarios and test cases for One-Time Purchase (OTP) (00:01:35). Edwin Torres also mentioned a way to test events generated on staging by using a platform that listens to CFKA topics, expecting to see events triggered for orders created during the session (00:00:00).

* SFMC and Katana Event Rollout Issues Nikita Gorshkov inquired about responses regarding event rollouts, particularly for the first issue, which Edwin Torres confirmed had no message received, leading them to plan to open a support ticket with the Katana group in Slack. Regarding the second topic, SFMC (Salesforce), Edwin Torres reported no response from Christian and the need to find someone else to assist, with Nikita Gorshkov subsequently requesting the link to the thread and inviting Manuel (00:04:27) (00:09:07). The team confirmed a need to create another message directly to the Katana support thread, with Nikita Gorshkov suggesting to ping Pablo and Brad and keep themself as an FYI (00:05:46).

* Refund and Testing Logistics Edwin Torres reported a refund issue with DM that is likely to be fixed next week due to the payments team working on an incident and capacity limitations (00:07:28). For the current testing session, Hamed Karimian and Edwin Torres agreed to test order creation on both live and staging environments to see if events are generated (00:10:58). Hamed Karimian completed a purchase on live to check for events, which Edwin Torres then checked by filtering by the customer ID (00:13:27).

* Order Processing and Event Confirmation Edwin Torres explained that completing an order triggers an event on a Kafka topic related to checkout, and the goal is to confirm the event was published and received by other subscribed services like Katana and Salesforce. Edwin Torres confirmed the event for the new live order was reported three minutes ago and linked the filter used to the meeting notes (00:32:06). The next step is to confirm that Katana and other systems receive this data (00:33:20).

* Shipping Fee Discrepancy for OTP Edwin Torres identified an issue with a s

ad here just to confirm something I got a OTP order I have the bundles here I click try now I will be able to add items as OTP orders or subscription or only subscription because the logic behind this section here on my dashboard is only affecting the subscription once. So we would need to extend that logic there.

Hamed Karimian: So is it possible to show the same model that we show to users to select between OTP and SNS?

Edwin Torres: That's what I'm thinking that we could do

 

 

01:21:00

 

Hamed Karimian: Yeah.

Edwin Torres: there.

Hamed Karimian: Yeah, that's I think what's expected over here.

Edwin Torres: Okay. Yeah. to work similarly as the credit page.

Hamed Karimian: Yeah, exactly.

Edwin Torres: Okay. Okay. Cool. Yeah, I think this one is like a million. This requires like a a factor there. Um, other than that, I think the others are manageable. Yep. All right. So, yeah, it looks like uh we already have a the priority identify it. So what I'm what we can do next uh is to create these uh tickets to follow up quickly and put the link here and and then um yeah share with the team as long as we are progressing and getting progress on that part. So basically uh we are only with Emily. So in these days we will work with Emily on the ones that we have here. Okay. So okay by saying that it means that tomorrow we will get an update on the progress on the medium and high priority ones and on Friday we will have another update regarding to when we release and also summing up the topic for the katana issue we have. Okay. uh if if we don't solve that so we cannot uh deploy on live

Hamed Karimian: Amazing. Yep. Sounds good.

Edwin Torres: okay

Hamed Karimian: Uh,

Nikita Gorshkov: Very

Edwin Torres: good all right

Hamed Karimian: yeah. Seem to be all

Nikita Gorshkov: nice.

Edwin Torres: team so yeah so yeah thank you very much for your time your patient on

Hamed Karimian: good.

﻿2026 Strategy

FTEs: 8 devs (3 parental fill, 2 backfills) → Q2 7 FE devs (+ 1EM +2 POs) + [new] 2 FE devs + 1 BE 

Q1: 7 FE devs (Himash, Becca, Romi, Pame, Nvard, Chi, Madeeha)

Q2: +2 FE devs, +Bolo & Richa back (11 total FEs), 1 BE (TBD)

H2 2025 Reflection

In H2 2025, our product strategy was designed to address unrecovered Conversion Rates (CR) and declining Active Order Rates (AOR). For CR, we successfully launched the Reactivation page revamp and are on progress to launch the One Time Purchase experiment. On the AOR side, we drove Free Add-on take rates to over 90% consistently by closing gaps in the selection and persistence experience, and launched Charge at Checkout.

1. Reactivation Page Revamp. We launched a new, mobile-first reactivation page that reduces the page length by one third with improvements on information architecture and clearer call to action. Also, customers can now choose their free add-ons directly on the reactivation page, instead of after reactivating their accounts. These changes are foundational to run more free for life reactivation campaigns including turkeys on Thanksgiving  (+20% CR YoY). However, some critical features were de-prioritized such as the ability to change cadence and reschedule directly on the reactivation page. 

2. One-Time Purchases (OTP). The technical solution for OTP pivoted from the initial MVP hack to the proper solution due to a technical blocker from CRM as well as higher confidence in the new endpoint following HF rollouts. While this solution saves time in the long-term, the launch week is delayed (likely W2’2026 - TBC) due to additional time for another technical investigation and (unplanned) capacity constraints.

3. Closing Free Add-on Take Rate. By October we finally reached +90% free add-on take rate for both new and active users consistently. Persisting free add-ons (+40% active TR), developing the multi-add-on pop-up on funnel and reactivation (+5% TR), and migrating bundle offers to Wallet (4.2k customers). While it’s great that we finally closed down the Wallet take rate gap, a significant portion of Q3 engineering capacity was allocated, which was not originally accounted for in the H2 roadmap.

4. Charge at Checkout. By charging customers at checkout instead of at cut-off, we aim to improve empty conversions and acceptance rates, thereby positively impacting overall delivered orders.





Learnings: 

* Better resource planning for adhoc and technical initiatives needed: We only executed on 2 out of 5 key strategies referenced in the previous strategy document with projects such as the Pricing Value Experiment getting pushed to next year. When planning for H2 2025, we did not initially account for initiatives such as Subscribable free add ons, as well as more tactical initiatives like 2-week cadence or legal compliance initiatives in the (cancellation) funnel. Engineering capacity was also impacted around September-October due to personnel changes, including one transfer to TPT and two individuals taking parental leave. We also need to proactively account for resourcing technical initiatives such as endpoint deprecations and migrations.

* More space needed for iterations: there are initiatives such as Seamless and Search with clear next iterations, however instead of building these we focused on building new initiatives. This delays implementing these learnings and therefore realization of business value. Doing these next iterations with too much time in between can also lengthen development as the team has to re-learn the technical context for the next iter

payment initiatives we should add?

[c]bnpl? :eyes:

[d]does ProcessOut unlock better capabilities (eg express checkout; bnpl)?





tbc cc @nikita.gorshkov@hellofresh.com

[e]More directly in our control: Payment failures experience in Actives experience





refer back to separate Payments discussions eg payment re-try

[f]We had discussed the delivery date picker test. Similarly, testing faster shipping to increase CVR

[g]it's here below the line

[h]plan in OTP for Actives? small lift if it's just about re-directing to a Plans page and exposing an OTP option only?

[i]if the results are positive, we'd still need significant effort to make it scalable from the data perspective. right now we'd be driving in the blind and rely on adhoc analysis, which is fine for the test but not ok for scaling marketing. basically it fully kills bob attribution based on vouchers

[j]depending on estimations we might de-prio this 





bigger upside for %-based discounts 





data on how many LL0 customers add Deals/Premium after?

[k]pre-requisite for later removing Plans page

[l]Ideally we only take this up once funnel clean up is done

[m]currently placed below the line despite bigger BC than Raf because we have already seen some improvements this year (+19% in Gross RR YoY, +14% in Net RR YoY)

[n]is it due to the new page? do we have pre/post?

[o]+ audience overlap

[p]i think this should be dependent on OTP leads results

[q]how come? I don't think the learnings from Leads test will necessarily transfer





It could work better because cancelled customers might have already experienced first-hand that subscription does not work 





We could even think about targeting specifically customers that have churned due to delivery frequency reasons

[r]-> hesitation more from a BC perspective + no ability to discount





-> refer to HF test learnings

[s]~10% cancel for "lifestyle" reason (="sub doens't work for me")

*2025-W52*
Spend: *$347,946* `-14% WoW` | Conversions: *1803* `-13% WoW` | Blended CAC: *$193* `-1% WoW` | Q4 Blended CCV/CAC+D: *0.98* `+24% QoQ`
• *Paid:* 1,423 sales (-15% WoW)
• *Reactivations*: 320 sales (-4% WoW)
• *Referrals:* 60 sales (-13% WoW)
*Highlights:*
• Meta CAC rose to $469 (+26% WoW) driven by 22% drop in CVR. On Friday, we launched the New Year’s Sales RNS + 20% off (thick-cut ribeyes, grass-fed ribeyes, top sirloin) and GCS + 20% off (grass-fed ribeyes, chicken breasts, Atlantic salmon). These were stuck in the learning phase through the weekend which impacted efficiency. We’ll provide a readout next Monday when the campaigns gather more learnings. *CPMs fell about 5% WoW which is on par with last year’s improvement W51→W52. However, CPMs are up 58% YoY which is the trend we’ve been seeing all year.* 
• Blended Google sales are down 17% and CAC is up 17% WoW due to a 25% increase in CPMs. *Impressions are down 22% WoW as search interest was lower due to the holiday.* We launched the New Year’s Sales campaign which also contributed to the inefficiency last week as campaigns entered the learning phase
• Affiliate sales are down 25% while CAC increased 20% WoW. *Similar to Google, demand was down in Search partners with sales decreasing 23% WoW.* 
• Paid Placement Performance:
    ◦ *Rakuten (Banner, Category Page Takeover):* 23 sales, $157 CAC
    ◦ *Hip2Save (IG Story, Hot Deal Pick in Newsletter, Homepage Slider):* $1,125 spend, 0 sales
    ◦ *Ibotta (Flash Cashback Lite, 2-day Home Banner):* 14 sales, $1k CAC
        ▪︎ <@U09JSDGHACT> let’s ask Chen to request a make-good
    ◦ *Perkspot (Trending Perks Placement):* 2 sales, $3.8k CAC
        ▪︎ <@U09JSDGHACT> let’s ask Chen to request a make-good
• PIP Agency sales increased 68% (95→160) and CAC improved 48% to $242. *The improvement was driven by Blackstone sales increasing 265% WoW (17→62).*
*Next Steps:*
• Monitor New Year’s sales across Meta, Native, and SEM
    ◦ Free Steak for Life + 20% Off (thick-cut ribeyes, grass-fed ribeyes, or top sirloin)
    ◦ Free Protein for Life + 20% Off (chicken breasts, salmon, grass-fed ribeyes)
• Relaunch Rokt and FirstMedia W52
• Launch tvScientific W2
• Evaluate Snap and TikTok relaunch
• Hold off on relaunching AppLovin until we can measure incrementality through Haus
