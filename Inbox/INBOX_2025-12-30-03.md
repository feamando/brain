Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Prateek Jajoo and Nikita Gorshkov discussed the signup page memo, focusing on Google Analytics inconsistencies and prioritizing CTA and passwordless features to combat a 24% abandonment rate, with a preference for the passwordless solution pending reliable data next week. They also addressed the CVR program, with Nikita Gorshkov asking Prateek Jajoo to work with DAS to define Q1 OKRs by February 9th, targeting the micro-conversion from "plans to dashboard." Finally, they reviewed Project LEGO's implementation for features like social login and considered its potential for a unified layout across Good Shop and Pet Stable, while confirming the high priority of express checkout by Apple Pay for the CVR program.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* Discussion with DAS on Signup Page and Analytics Prateek Jajoo briefed Nikita Gorshkov about their discussion with DAS regarding the signup page memo, which included reviewing Google Analytics data that showed inconsistencies, specifically a 24% abandonment rate compared to HelloFresh (00:00:00). Prateek Jajoo prioritized two features—CTA and passwordless—to address the drop-off, creating a PRD that was reviewed by EMTT and will be shared with Nikita Gorshkov. Prateek Jajoo indicated that the passwordless solution would be the preferred direction once reliable data is secured from the analytics team next week (00:01:06).

* CVR Program and Q1 OKRs The CVR program was discussed as a close collaboration with DAS involving prioritization and execution, estimated to take up 50% of Prateek Jajoo's capacity, though Nikita Gorshkov suggested efficiency could reduce this over time after the initial setup (00:02:16). Nikita Gorshkov requested Prateek Jajoo to work with DAS to define OKRs or ambition levels for Q1, specifically targeting the micro conversion from "plans to dashboard" and to provide this target by next Friday, February 9th (00:03:25). Prateek Jajoo confirmed they only needed the ambition level for now (00:04:19).

* Project LEGO and Checkout Funnel Strategy Prateek Jajoo asked about timelines and the appropriate contact person for implementing Project LEGO, particularly features like social login (00:04:19). Nikita Gorshkov explained that Alex estimated 70 engineering days for refactoring the current Good Shop funnel, prompting consideration of transitioning to LEGO instead. The challenge for both Good Shop and Pet Stable is that Project LEGO currently lacks pre-checkout menu selection, but it may allow for extracting the address and checkout page for a unified layout, which would enable the reuse of components from HelloFresh (00:05:23).

* Pricing, Bugs, and Express Checkout Priority Prateek Jajoo plans to develop a problem statement for pricing to initiate discussions with design for a short-term and long-term fix (00:07:22). Prateek Jajoo also noted a bug where hitting the back button from the recipe selection page incorrectly sent customers to the first quiz question, but observed that the tech team may have already fixed it (00:08:28). Finally, Nikita Gorshkov confirmed that express checkout by Apple Pay should be prioritized and integrated into the CVR program, alongside the one-pager on the app, as both are high priority (00:09:59).





Suggested next steps

* Prateek Jajoo will check the OKRs or ambition levels for the micro conversion from plans to dashboard that Nikita Gorshkov posted in the product channel and togethe

Prateek Jajoo: Here pick and if we go back as in we should go to the meal selection page, right?

Nikita Gorshkov: There might be a slight delay.

Prateek Jajoo: No, no,

Nikita Gorshkov: Like that's the issue.

Prateek Jajoo: no. It it uh generally goes to the first question. So, maybe they fixed it already. The bug was it when you hit back,

Nikita Gorshkov: Okay.

Prateek Jajoo: it went to the first page, which is the first page of the quiz.

 

 

00:09:59

 

Prateek Jajoo: So, the customer travels back and have to complete the quiz again. Uh yeah. So, they fixed it basically.

Nikita Gorshkov: Okay.

Prateek Jajoo: Okay.

Nikita Gorshkov: Cool.

Prateek Jajoo: So uh and the last few things yeah I actually wanted to just get an understanding of the next things that I'm doing right so it was uh a one pager on the app that's one thing that's needed express checkout by Apple Pay

Nikita Gorshkov: Yes.

Prateek Jajoo: that you also said hey we need this and like that so is there anything that you would want me

Nikita Gorshkov: Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

Prateek Jajoo: to prioritize

Nikita Gorshkov: I would take the uh so uh in any case the CVR oh both of these are kind of

Prateek Jajoo: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: priority so you can focus uh on this but the express checkout you can add into the uh CVR program because it's it's one of it's perfectly fits into that whole thing.

Prateek Jajoo: Got it. Okay. Cool. I love Android. Okay. Cool. Go ahead.

Most ginger cats are boys, by a landslide.



For every ginger girl, there are roughly three ginger lads because the ginger gene sits on the X chromosome. Females need two copies to go full orange; males only need one.



Basically, ginger is the default setting for cat men.



**What’s in store:**



* **New Year’s resolutions** are so much better with AI!



* **AI Predictions 2026: **The year of Evals?

## Stop Making Random New Year’s Resolutions - Make Custom Ones with ChatGPT!

Every December, we all do the same thing. 



We declare resolutions that sound good, but have nothing to do with how we actually live.



_“Read 100 books!”_

_“Run every day!”_

_“Become a minimalist!”_



While making New Year’s resolutions is never a bad idea, it’s important to make ones that are realistic, given your lifestyle, budget, and account for, well, life. 



This year, don’t pick aspirational resolutions. Pick personalized ones!



Here’s how to turn ChatGPT into your personal resolution strategist.



### **ChatGPT needs to learn more about you, first*

is useless. B2B customers are not impressed by "cool" AI features that show promise but are unreliable. They need consistent value from software like they always have. Delivering value from Agents requires better Context and Quality Measurement (aka Evals)._



* _Context - The data supplied to agents. Context improvement is a hot topic of research and development. The winners will be companies that excel in building context._

_ _



* _Evals - Required to know if context updates and other optimizations are effective. Without them solution providers are stumbling around in the dark._



_  2026, the year of Context and Evals._

### EMAIL: Notes: “Prateek:Nikita 1:1” Dec 30, 2025

Notes from “Prateek:Nikita 1:1”



These notes have been sent to invited guests in your organization.



Open meeting notes



The content was auto-generated on December 30, 2025, 5:09 PM CET and may  

contain errors.





Summary



Prateek Jajoo and Nikita Gorshkov discussed the signup page memo, focusing  

on Google Analytics inconsistencies and prioritizing CTA and passwordless  

features to combat a 24% abandonment rate, with a preference for the  

passwordless solution pending reliable data next week. They also addressed  

the CVR program, with Nikita Gorshkov asking Prateek Jajoo to work with DAS  

to define Q1 OKRs by February 9th, targeting the micro-conversion  

from "plans to dashboard." Finally, they reviewed Project LEGO's  

implementation for features like social login and considered its potential  

for a unified layout across Good Shop and Pet Stable, while confirming the  

high priority of express checkout by Apple Pay for the CVR program.





Suggested next steps





Prateek Jajoo will check the OKRs or ambition levels for the micro  

conversion from plans to dashboard that Nikita Gorshkov posted in the  

product channel and together with dovas give Nikita Gorshkov a target to  

hit within Q1 by next Friday, January 9th.
