Summary

Hamed Karimian convened a meeting to resolve outstanding VMS launch blockers for OTP, which included events not being received in Katana and Salesforce, and an error during refund payments; participants confirmed that the first two issues, which manifested immediately in live internal orders, were R&D blockers for launch. Participants Alexander Matlin, Nikita Gorshkov, Edwin Torres, and Morteza Pourkazemi discussed that while functional testing was successful on staging, the Katana and Salesforce events needed live testing, and they theorized the lack of triggered events might be due to a business division issue requiring the `grow go kit` library or a configuration problem like "factor market" not being enabled, as the orchestrator "ops" likely emits these events. The team agreed that the refund payment issue, which Edwin Torres noted requires an update to the `grow go kit` library to properly handle the new business division, can be deferred to week two, while Alexander Matlin will contact Marat and Arem from the plans squad regarding the event production issues, escalating to an incident if no response is received by 12 PM Berlin time the following day, and Nikita Gorshkov asked Hamed Karimian to investigate a manual refund process in the interim.





Details

Notes Length: Standard

* VMS Launch Blockers for OTP Hamed Karimian introduced the main goal of the meeting: to resolve outstanding issues for the OTP launch for VMS, with the hope of going live next week. The identified blockers include not receiving events in Katana, Salesforce not receiving OTP events, and an error during refund payments on OTP. Nikita Gorshkov suggested that the refund payment issue could be resolved in week two, prioritizing the first two issues as R\&D blockers for launch.

* Testing Environment and Live Issues Alexander Matlin asked if the issues were consistently present since the internal-only live launch, which Hamed Karimian confirmed, noting that the two first orders on live, made by internal users, immediately exhibited these problems (00:01:10). Edwin Torres explained that while functional tests, error handling, and other cases worked on staging, they lacked the ability to test the Katana and Salesforce parts in staging, necessitating testing on live with specific customers (00:02:13). Morteza Pourkazemi stated that testing for TCS (Salesforce side) and Katana is possible on staging, suggesting that for Salesforce, ensuring the email has the underlying test suffix should allow testing (00:03:46).

* Missing Events to Katana and Salesforce Edwin Torres confirmed that orders were created successfully and visible in "all" or Bob, but communications to Katana and Salesforce events were not triggered (00:06:26). Edwin Torres theorized that the lack of triggered events, which means the customer would not receive the physical product, might be related to the business division and the required use of the `grow go kit` library (00:07:36). Alexander Matlin and Nikita Gorshkov discussed that the problem might be a configuration issue since the same API points are used by other brands, suggesting that the "factor market" might not be enabled (00:08:51).

* Identifying Event Emitters and Next Steps for Blockers Edwin Torres initially thought the events were generated by Customer Order Services, but after reviewing a diagram, concluded that "ops,

o be seeing at the moment, uh my ask to you Hammed, would be how can we figure out a refund process that would be manual like uh uh with the team throughout uh next week so that if a refund is requested, we can trigger some kind of refunds one way or the other manually extracting this particular order number, what have you.

Tech teams,Non-Tech teams,,

Consumer Core,Marketing NA,,"2. What happens if I edit/ delete a row on my Alliance tab? 
- Except the Acceptance status column, nothing else should be edited on this sheet. Doing so will result in information inconsistencies that would impact you and the requestor"

Data,Operations NA,,

Decisions,Marketing INTL,,"3. What are the expected actions I need to do on my Alliance tab?
- Review the dependency and update the Acceptance status column                                        "

* Vouchers to apply the correct discounts (source)

   * OTP price: X (fixed) = the original prices

      * (OTP can’t be discounted with a voucher)

   * SNS:

      * First box: MOV >= $65 → 40% off the OTP price, less than threshold→ 20% off

      * Second box onward: MOV >= $65→ 20% off the OTP price, less than threshold→ 10% off

Attendees: Wellney Yarra Laura Loughran Hamed Karimian jordon.smith@hellofresh.ca Amy Cheong Ben Nasseby Shindy Lu Tess Cavalieri Tyler Epidy Simon Perez Michael James Clarke Nikita Gorshkov Pantelis Chatzinikolis





Notes

* Add new meal_swap #s for Creatine + Meal Shake before launch → we’ll def do so → Hamed to add it to the roadmap items for Jan

* OTP Launch update → 

* [Shindy] W49: large week for tech errors Factor Form | CC Errors.xlsx → For Shindy and Hamed to investigate

* 50% off discount id comm needs to be created

   * Hamed to double check the banner behaviour

   * Amy/Laura to confirm with Megan Thomson/





Options

	Pros

	Cons

	Decision

	Launch W50

	More time before AD/ND

Time to iterate if issues

Time to rollout gradually





	Won’t make it! 

Less time for e2e testing

	No Go

	Launch W51 (To 90% of users)

	Original plan

On-track from dev pov

Captures business value earlier (~$15k in revenue)





	Super risky as most devs are out (Jordon, Jan, Edwin, Emily, Daniel, Travis)

Super close to EOY

Might break something on Factor

Not enough time for gradual rollout

On-calls: Emily Stanek (W50), Paul Andrews (W51/52)

	Maybe

	Launch W51 

(To only 10%)

	Mitigates the risk

Collects some feedback before the peak

	Still risky (Not enough devs to support)

Limited business impact





	No Go

	Launch W02

(To 90% of users)

	Less risky (Devs available for support)

Still before the actual peak

Won’t break anything on Factor/FF

	Delayed launch

Opportunity cost





	Go! 













	  W46 2024 - W04 2025 → The market is pretty soft over the last few weeks of the year

Notes

* Laura’s crazy idea to gate the 50% off for a year to Factor Actives, +$65

   * Jordan’s less crazy idea to check old logic → if RTE active, apply this voucher 

   * If not RTE active, default back to regular voucher (40% off)





* Tyler EpidyAmy Cheong email comms with active users about

   * Price changes for Protein and Hydrations, email template here: Protein and

marketing plans for OTP on FF website

* CC: Ronald Weston and his team

   * OTP only supports cancel and refund (doesn’t support change to the order, delivery address, delivery date, or the items in the order)

* Fulfillment & Delivery: Shindy Lu

   * We can’t test the delivery on staging, so we should test it on production before launch. 

      * Make sure that Propac gets the order info accurately

NPD (Meal Shake/Creatine)

* What to show on the product tiles in the meantime?

   * “Buy on Amazon” vs. “Buy on Shopify” → Finalizing the decision: we’re not going with the “Notify me” option, so no need to build the modals.  





Action items

* Tyler to sync up with Jordon to find out the right event to use for the OTP confirmation as well as cart abandonment → sales event QA good chop (nov 2025) 

* Simon to work on distinction between OTP & SNS → Hamed and Alexandra are working on it

* Tyler to send an email about raising the price on Hydrations & Proteins

* Hamed to sync up with Ronald about the CC issues

### DOC: Memo: TPT Sign-up Page Revamp

----------------------------------------

﻿Memo: Signup Page drop off rates

Data reveals (chart below) that the registration page on ThePetsTable adds little friction to the customer journey to the address page. In 2025, the total “Visited Address” (12.25%) sessions is higher than “Visited Registration” (11.62%) sessions for PetsTable, this is in sharp contrast to the HelloFresh sessions data, where over 45% users are lost from registration to address page. The sessions drop off in PetsTable is significantly lower because of three reasons:





1. The registration page is skipped entirely for customers who logged in a previous session, and are redirected to the checkout page directly by the site cookies. HelloFresh also has the same behavior but in the case of PetsTable, the customer is completing registration often and also coming back more often to a previously logged in session. 





2. The higher registration completion rate can also be attributed to high intent and cognitive investment of the customer, who before reaching the registration page has completed 9 steps of the quiz (which sometimes needs research - pup weight, dietary preference, allergies, goals) and selected the plan & recipe selection. The % session for HelloFresh, ThePetsTable and GoodChop remain the same to the Address page. 





3. Plus, increasing propensity to make more premium & health conscious choices for their pets over themselves, drives higher intent in completion of the PetsTable account registration, than that of HelloFresh. 





Given that the registration step isn’t resulting in customer drop offs, the removal of the page is not likely to increase conversions. The registration page is in fact necessary[a][b][c][d] to verify whether a prospect already has an account, which helps in redirecting existing users to the reactivation page (and adjusting applicable discounts), and prevents them from redundantly navigating the entire signup funnel. After enabling email autopopulation on the registration page from WKND cookie, the friction on this page has declined further. Therefore, we advocate to keep the registration page, make minimal functional changes and improve the sign up CTA to increase the customer intent further to complete checkout.





The Pets Table (More sessions to Address page than the Registration page):

  







Hello Fresh (Over 55% customers drop from Registration page to Address page):

  







  Current Experience:

Note that the funnel data above captures conversions from the registration page before we started auto populating the customer email from the WKND cookie (link). In majority of the cases, customers will now see the email populated and are directly prompted to enter a password, which should be a delightful customer experience. 





Given that we do not have any password rules or checks currently on the page, customers can set any password and can navigate to the address page. HelloFresh data also shows that only 3.4% users abandon[e] (link) the registration process without submitting a password after providing their email address. 





However, we can optimize this page UI to move away from a transactional tone to an emotional tone to further improve customer intent to complete the checkout. [f]





We should also note immediate 2 weeks conversions [g]post the improvements from WKND cookies for any adverse customer experiences.

While not a major source of customer drop off, we still have the opportunity to improve the login experience for the first time visitors on the website to move them quickly through the

bmitting a password after providing their email address. Therefore, the password itself is not a friction point but providing another way to login could help conversions. 





Though an innovative way to login may not result in a similar increase in conversions from older customer base, who are more accustomed to login/password UX, and are already comfortable completing registrations on the PetsTable.

Impact: Medium

Effort: 8 pts





	Use social logins

	Provide customers with social login options like  Apple, Google & Facebook to improve registration completion and improve conversions

	In HelloFresh, adding social logins (statsig) increased the conversion rate by 2.66%. However, we hypothesize social logins will not have much impact on registration completion rate in the PetsTable (& thus conversions) as our customer demographics is much older (>50% customers are 50+ years old), who are less likely to use social logins.

Impact: Low

Open Question: Do we remove the Add-ons promotions CTA?

Rationale for keeping the Add-ons banner:

1. Two experiments that tested adding a seasonal promotional banner on the Sign up page resulted (in a similar location as the Add-ons promotional banner) in positive improvements in CVR. 

2. Customers hear about the Add-ons product for the first time in the sign up page and create intent to buy add-ons during checkout. 

Rationale for removing Add-ons banner:

1. Test moving one of the below the fold element (Social proof, product stat) on the banner location to further increase customer intent on checkout. 





Given that we already prioritized an initiative (improve sign up CTA) to improve content and don't have experimental bandwidth, we recommend to keep the add-ons banner. 









  



[a]OK, what's not clear for me - what's the customer problem; basically, reading this, my POV would be - why touch this at all? I am certain we have bigger fish to fry and the improvement that we caen get from here doesn't seem to be worth the investment even on a discovery level; no?

[b]Yes … The CTA would have customer attention and we can optimize it and we can do some correct representation of reviews but the page is good as is.

[c]_Marked as resolved_

[d]_Re-opened_

[e]~30% according to GA

[f]but should we? Based on the data above?

[g]not clear what do you mea by this?

,

,Q1 capitalization audit

,Please follow the instructions below 

Step 1,Go to the tab of your respective alliance

Step 2,"Verify Column G - Finance/Portfolio Decision , for the final decision on Capitalisation of the KR."

,"If you want to challenge this decision, please change Column H - Do you want to challenge the decision? to Yes. Provide supporting commentary in Column I - Comment."

Step 3,Verify Column J - Check Questions to understand which question you need to answer:

,A - Provide evidence this KR results in the creation of assets in Column I - Comment.

,"B - Check column L - B. Does the KR result in economic benefit?

If the cell is highlighted with ‘Oops, there is no YP strategy provided for this KR’  you need to provide the YP/QAR strategy this KR is associated with on the OKR Management Tool - Column AP (Input - Tech Strategy) or you need to explain why this KR is associated with a strategy with an economic benefit.

If the cell is highlighted with ‘This KR is associated with KTLO but we believe it delivers benefit and results in the creation of assets. Please advise',  you need to help us map this KR to an economic benefit.

If the cell is highlighted with ‘KR not found on the OKR Tool’, please help us map days reported to another KR."

,"C - Change value in column M - C. Percentage of work reported in cap activities YTD that is actually capitalisable if the KR is set to not meet or canceled, if it is partially capitalisable, or if there is need to ensure teams are not reporting non-capitalisable activities.

You can also use this column to correct the number of capitalisable days if there were mistakes in the reporting during the previous months (see FAQ 3 for more details)."

,"If the column is “-” there are no open question to address and if there are more than one item (i.e. B, C) please address both questions."

----------------------------------------

Purpose,

,Overview of the Product & Engineering organization and members of the Consumer mega alliance. Complementing the limited views from workday and adaptive.

Context,

,The actual source of truth remains Workday for all employee data and reporting lines

,"In many cases managers have to have a way to plan ahead, to get an overview over a larger part of the org, to add more data like what programming languages someone can contribute in or a logical grouoping by triebs and squads. To avoid that everyone has to do the same work and to keep track of relevant metrics we maintain this central sheet for the whole alliance (Product, engineering)."

,The sheet is only shared with CS8+ managers. 

,For questions contact Holger Hammel

Main sheet - CMA,

,Please always use Filter views

,"CS8+ Tribe leads are responsible to keep the sheet up to date. This includes timely updates to status, dates of contract changes, reporting & squad assignments"

,TBD: how to sync and spot conflicts btw workday and adaptive and this sheet

,

(Dont change) Squad,

,"As indicated in the tab name, this view show the assignment of employees to squads."

,"The view is generated fromt the data in CMA, so please don't change any values"

(Copy to Overview)  Squads,

,Use this tab to COPY UNLINKED to other documents like Consumer Mega Alliance - Overview

Don't show in Squad view,

,"Set this checkbox to true if the person should not appear in the squad overview views. An example is if someone is on garden leave, then they would still appear in the list, but are not technically working in the squad anymore."

Values ...,

,Value Tabs are holding the values for dropdowns in CMA.

,"Adding or changing values impact those dropdowns and the validation, "

,"If a value has to change, e.g. a new squad or change of name, then change it here, and not on the dropdown fields in CMA"

Pivot,

,Various Pivot tables for analytics on the CMA data. 

,If you want to add new Pivots for a tribe etc please add a tab with preix Pivot:
