----------------------------------------

Purpose,

,Overview of the Product & Engineering organization and members of the Consumer mega alliance. Complementing the limited views from workday and adaptive.

Context,

,The actual source of truth remains Workday for all employee data and reporting lines

,"In many cases managers have to have a way to plan ahead, to get an overview over a larger part of the org, to add more data like what programming languages someone can contribute in or a logical grouoping by triebs and squads. To avoid that everyone has to do the same work and to keep track of relevant metrics we maintain this central sheet for the whole alliance (Product, engineering)."

,The sheet is only shared with CS8+ managers. 

,For questions contact Holger Hammel

Main sheet - CMA,

,Please always use Filter views

,"CS8+ Tribe leads are responsible to keep the sheet up to date. This includes timely updates to status, dates of contract changes, reporting & squad assignments"

,TBD: how to sync and spot conflicts btw workday and adaptive and this sheet

,

(Dont change) Squad,

,"As indicated in the tab name, this view show the assignment of employees to squads."

,"The view is generated fromt the data in CMA, so please don't change any values"

(Copy to Overview)  Squads,

,Use this tab to COPY UNLINKED to other documents like Consumer Mega Alliance - Overview

Don't show in Squad view,

,"Set this checkbox to true if the person should not appear in the squad overview views. An example is if someone is on garden leave, then they would still appear in the list, but are not technically working in the squad anymore."

Values ...,

,Value Tabs are holding the values for dropdowns in CMA.

,"Adding or changing values impact those dropdowns and the validation, "

,"If a value has to change, e.g. a new squad or change of name, then change it here, and not on the dropdown fields in CMA"

Pivot,

,Various Pivot tables for analytics on the CMA data. 

,If you want to add new Pivots for a tribe etc please add a tab with preix Pivot:

﻿Memo: Signup Page drop off rates

Data reveals (chart below) that the registration page on ThePetsTable adds little friction to the customer journey to the address page. In 2025, the total “Visited Address” (12.25%) sessions is higher than “Visited Registration” (11.62%) sessions for PetsTable, this is in sharp contrast to the HelloFresh sessions data, where over 45% users are lost from registration to address page. The sessions drop off in PetsTable is significantly lower because of three reasons:





1. The registration page is skipped entirely for customers who logged in a previous session, and are redirected to the checkout page directly by the site cookies. HelloFresh also has the same behavior but in the case of PetsTable, the customer is completing registration often and also coming back more often to a previously logged in session. 





2. The higher registration completion rate can also be attributed to high intent and cognitive investment of the customer, who before reaching the registration page has completed 9 steps of the quiz (which sometimes needs research - pup weight, dietary preference, allergies, goals) and selected the plan & recipe selection. The % session for HelloFresh, ThePetsTable and GoodChop remain the same to the Address page. 





3. Plus, increasing propensity to make more premium & health conscious choices for their pets over themselves, drives higher intent in completion of the PetsTable account registration, than that of HelloFresh. 





Given that the registration step isn’t resulting in customer drop offs, the removal of the page is not likely to increase conversions. The registration page is in fact necessary[a][b][c][d] to verify whether a prospect already has an account, which helps in redirecting existing users to the reactivation page (and adjusting applicable discounts), and prevents them from redundantly navigating the entire signup funnel. After enabling email autopopulation on the registration page from WKND cookie, the friction on this page has declined further. Therefore, we advocate to keep the registration page, make minimal functional changes and improve the sign up CTA to increase the customer intent further to complete checkout.





The Pets Table (More sessions to Address page than the Registration page):

  







Hello Fresh (Over 55% customers drop from Registration page to Address page):

  







  Current Experience:

Note that the funnel data above captures conversions from the registration page before we started auto populating the customer email from the WKND cookie (link). In majority of the cases, customers will now see the email populated and are directly prompted to enter a password, which should be a delightful customer experience. 





Given that we do not have any password rules or checks currently on the page, customers can set any password and can navigate to the address page. HelloFresh data also shows that only 3.4% users abandon[e] (link) the registration process without submitting a password after providing their email address. 





However, we can optimize this page UI to move away from a transactional tone to an emotional tone to further improve customer intent to complete the checkout. [f]





We should also note immediate 2 weeks conversions [g]post the improvements from WKND cookies for any adverse customer experiences. 

	  



	Sign up page Improvements:

Vision

While not a major source of customer drop off, we still have the opportunity to improve the login experience for the first time visitors on the website to move them quickly through the

... [TRUNCATED: 2093 chars omitted to save context] ...

bmitting a password after providing their email address. Therefore, the password itself is not a friction point but providing another way to login could help conversions. 





Though an innovative way to login may not result in a similar increase in conversions from older customer base, who are more accustomed to login/password UX, and are already comfortable completing registrations on the PetsTable.   

	P1 





Impact: Medium

Effort: 8 pts





	Use social logins

	Provide customers with social login options like  Apple, Google & Facebook to improve registration completion and improve conversions

	In HelloFresh, adding social logins (statsig) increased the conversion rate by 2.66%. However, we hypothesize social logins will not have much impact on registration completion rate in the PetsTable (& thus conversions) as our customer demographics is much older (>50% customers are 50+ years old), who are less likely to use social logins.

	P2





Impact: Low

Effort: 8 pts

	















Open Question: Do we remove the Add-ons promotions CTA?

Rationale for keeping the Add-ons banner:

1. Two experiments that tested adding a seasonal promotional banner on the Sign up page resulted (in a similar location as the Add-ons promotional banner) in positive improvements in CVR. 

2. Customers hear about the Add-ons product for the first time in the sign up page and create intent to buy add-ons during checkout. 

Rationale for removing Add-ons banner:

1. Test moving one of the below the fold element (Social proof, product stat) on the banner location to further increase customer intent on checkout. 





Given that we already prioritized an initiative (improve sign up CTA) to improve content and don't have experimental bandwidth, we recommend to keep the add-ons banner. 









  



[a]OK, what's not clear for me - what's the customer problem; basically, reading this, my POV would be - why touch this at all? I am certain we have bigger fish to fry and the improvement that we caen get from here doesn't seem to be worth the investment even on a discovery level; no?

[b]Yes … The CTA would have customer attention and we can optimize it and we can do some correct representation of reviews but the page is good as is.

[c]_Marked as resolved_

[d]_Re-opened_

[e]~30% according to GA

[f]but should we? Based on the data above?

[g]not clear what do you mea by this?

New Ventures Operational Overhead calculation



"How it works

This sheet provides the percentage of operational overhead (i.e. KTLO work per month). Each team has a dedicated tab. For this to work, you need to
* add the label KTLO to all Jira tickets that you consider KTLO work
* Make sure all tickets that move into the “resolved” state have assigned story points. Add the actual story point in hindsight for accurate operational overhead calculation
A cron job runs every night and updates this sheet. It used the resolved date to include a ticket in the calculation for a specific month.

,,

,Plan,Pricing Principles at Launch

,All,Max box price should be $250 

,Fresh/Topper/Mixed,Max freezer fill is 1/3 a small NYC apt freezer

,Fresh,Aim to price lower than TFD but only if we can make PC2 margins and economics work

,All,Charge shipping separate to box price

,All,Shipping free in first order

,All,Price per day for trial is same as for regular box before discount

,All,Price per lb does not need to decrease as calories increase within same plan although it should go in that general direction

,All,"If we ship the same amount of product, the price should be the same"

,,

,Step,Description

,1: Import costs,All costs by plan imported into pricing file

,2: Benchmark,Competitors benchmarked to build up their pricing curves

,3: Scenarios,"High level pricing scenarios chosen per plan - final scenarios chosen:
- Fresh: Match TFD prices excluding shipping fee. Fresh is headline price to fix rest to
- Mixed: Should be 5-15% below Fresh depending on size and margins
- Topper: Should be 55-62.5% of Fresh price for 50% of product depending on size and margins
- Dry: Should be lowest price and price at 38% margins"

,4: Smooth pricing,Scenarios lead to choppy pricing. This was then smoothed

,5: Check PC2 / ROIs,PC2 and ROI reviewed to increase prices and improve margins where they were low

,6: Make steps,"If giving the same qty of product for 2 or more different SKUs, the prices were matched to create some stepped pricing"

,,

,,

,Type,Elements to Change in Price Test

,Architecture issue,Ensure same amount of food in box is always the same price

,Architecture issue,Review price per Lb curves i.e. price per LB should go down as calories increase

,Architecture issue,Review PC2 margins by calories within plan; and PC2 margins across calories

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Air Dried price to have lower entry price point to increase TAM

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Fresh price to be more competitive with Farmers Dog & Ollie

,Competitor pricing,Test lowering Mixed price to sit in appropriate area between Fresh & Air Dried (being wary where Pantry Fresh would be)

,Architecture issue,"Lower price for larger dogs more than smaller dogs to encourage share of larger, higher ROI dogs"

## 10 Questions for AI leaders: Jodie Cook

Caption: 



Jodie Cook, founder of Coachvox AI and a senior contributor at Forbes, has a distinctly unsentimental take on the AI era: change is inevitable, progress is ripe for the bold, and anything a robot can do, humans probably shouldn’t. 



In our interview, she talked about using AI to become more human, why entrepreneurs should embrace volatility, and how intention, not automation, is the real superpower of the next decade.



**When you think about AI’s current trajectory, what excites you the most? Does anything worry you?**



_Change is the only constant, and it scares most people. But true entrepreneurs thrive in periods of change. Progress is made during times of change. _



_I’m excited

ching buyers underserved._



_AI will deliver millions in pipeline just by replacing spray-and-pray “speed-to-lead” volume with helpful, two-way conversations that remove friction._



_These conversations will speak __**with**__ buyers, not __**at**__ them, using who the buyer is AND what they have shown interest in to insightfully connect them to the right resources, people, and next steps to quickly solve their problem._



_Today’s prediction comes from Maddie Bell, _CEO of [Synapsa](https://www.synapsa.ai/) and author of [The AI Pipeline Conversion Playbook](https://www.synapsa.ai/ai-pipeline-conversion-playbook)!
