# 2026 HFG Domain Objectives - RTE

﻿Domain Objectives

Working Group/PoCs: Ed BoyesAdam Park        Updated: September 2025

________________





Section 1: Context - RTE as core growth driver for HFG





Factor US is now the largest business unit within HFG, and Ready-to-Eat (RTE) is the Group’s single largest mid-term revenue and profitability expansion opportunity. Today, our global RTE strategy is driven by four business units—Factor US, CA, EU, and YouFoodz in ANZ. For simplicity, this paper refers to the full RTE portfolio collectively as “Factor.”





Our immediate operational priorities—restoring Factor US retention and unlocking EU expansion via Verden—are well-defined and underway. This paper looks beyond these immediate plans to chart our 2026 priorities in light of the disruptive forces reshaping food, health, and consumer behavior.





For our DTC business, it has become crystal clear that to lead in the next chapter, we must evolve beyond a transactional model (AOR 5–6) into a trusted, habitual health partner (AOR 10+). Retention is the core metric for a sustainable membership business—proof of product-market fit, customer satisfaction, and long-term profitability. AOR 10+ would signal a differentiated model vs. where we are today and significantly better economics. A high retention rate is also critical to ecosystem value and cross-sell potential, supporting our ambition to become the world’s leading, fully integrated food solutions group.

At the same time, the Factor brand has stretch potential far beyond the current DTC model - across high-growth categories (e.g., VMS) and new channels (Retail, Foodservice, Food as Medicine, B2B) - positioning us as a full health and lifestyle brand rather than a DTC “RTE” player.

Key market dynamics and opportunities shaping our future

* The DTC RTE segment is poised to become more fragmented and competitive. Competitors mirror once-differentiating claims (“chef-crafted,” “dietitian-approved,” “fresh never frozen,”  etc.) while CAC rises, AOR plateaus, and growth slows

* Consumers want precision health. Demand is shifting from “healthy” to “exactly right for me” with an increasingly high bar for personalization, health benefits, and frictionless experiences. Whether it’s GLP-1 users, women in different life stages, fitness communities, or those managing chronic conditions - consumers want meals tailored to their biology, life stage, and goals

* Health is being redefined. Wearables, CGMs, and diagnostics platforms are redefining what it means to be healthy - glucose level, inflammation, sleep, recovery, longevity, various aspects of athletic and cognitive performance, as well as preventing and managing chronic diseases. But most platforms can only offer insight. They don’t close the loop with food execution

* Food innovation is accelerating. The food industry is responding to health trends with new protein formats, functional ingredients, and better-for-you snacking. Premium margins are commanded by brands that can reformulate products to optimize for nutritional values, banned ingredients & additives, and less processing; even brands that cater more to indulgence vs. health, need to offer healthier versions of crowd favorites

* Food as experience: Content around food, exercise, diet and lifestyle is exploding on social media but without a solution to close the loop between content and food experience. Services like AirBnB are doubling down on food as a key strategy to evolve from functional to an experiential service

* Omnichannel expectations are the norm. Most food spend still occurs outside DTC. To scale, brands must show up across the food journey—at work, retail, foodservice and through providers

* Europe remains a key market: With a large TAM and operational leverage from our existing infrastructure, Factor EU represents a priority near-term expansion opportunity

* Profitability remains a core challenge in ANZ: Profitable growth will require pivoting from discount-led to a product-led growth, omni-channel strategy that drives reactivation, expansion into underserved segments, and unlocking cross-channel synergies between DTC and Retail

Section 2: Domain Objectives





Our long-term vision is to be the undisputed health-forward RTE and performance nutrition leader, achieving AOR 10+, and evolving beyond DTC into a global health and lifestyle platform.

Our 2026 Strategy, in service of this goal, is to build a brand that stands for “athlete-level quality, delivered to all”.

Our Domain Objectives outline the priority investments needed to execute on this strategy.









1. Objective: PRODUCT & SERVICE QUALITY MUST DRIVE TRUST & RETENTION, NOT BE A BARRIER

Measure of success: iNPS & rNPS +15pts vs. 2025 baseline

Objective Owner: Dan Seidel

Investment Type: Existing    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  1. Quality, Packaging and Ingredient SKU innovation 

Description: Trust is foundational, yet poor and inconsistent quality undermines retention and our brand perception today. We must reset product value and quality to category-leading standards, particularly across flavor, freshness, portion size, and ops errors. When customers have sub-par experiences, service recovery must also excel. 





* Ingredient quality: Invest in most-used and quality perception driving ingredients (e.g., chicken, ground meat, fresh veg, seafood, branded sauces, garnishes)

* Recipe improvements: Focus on biggest AOR drivers (for example, vs. overindexing on NPD, to reach recipe score >3.45)

* Portion size: Eliminate inconsistency, especially vegetables and sides

* Shelf-life: Establish model that maximizes end-to-end customer satisfaction, balancing value, quality, and convenience

* Errors: Cut total ops errors to <2.5% (logs error <1%); eliminate cracked bentos; strengthen proactive/recovery comms

* Reheat times: Optimized for ideal eating experience (e.g., 2-3 minutes max)

* Local kitchens: Pilot to test supply chain and product benefits





2. Objective: NEVER LET CUSTOMERS GET BORED

Measure of success: Menu-related cancellation & pause rates <1%

Objective Owner:  Adam Park

Investment Type: Existing     |   HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  2. XL Menu Expansion 

Description: To deliver athlete-level quality at scale, we must pair nutrition credibility with menu variety and lifestyle relevance - broadening our appeal and progressively onboarding customers from light-touch health seekers to those who seek to adopt more health and functional goals to expand share of wallet without alienating casual users.  Also, it is well-understood by now, particularly in competitive markets, that the No. 1 reason for high-potential customers who leave us to go a competitor do so because they get bored (“it all starts to taste the same”, “it’s always some version of meat + potato + sauce”). How we develop Variety is key to addressing these challenges:





a) Build on-ramp & boredom-proof (AOR) - Focus on cuisine, flavor, texture, ingredient, format, LTOs. e.g., 

* Prioritize and step-change variety across protein (incl. seafood), veg, carb, sauce / flavor driver, texture, and garnish

* Launch / expand range in top 3-5 priority cuisines for the local market

* Offer “healthiest versions” of crowd favorites: e.g., Burgers / sandwiches, handhelds, stuffed pastas, dumplings, pizza, etc

* Launch a structured LTO program with at least 4 LTOs across the year

* Unlock modularity for at least 1/3 of total slots





b) Make all-day health easy & increase basket size (AOV) - Focus on meal occasions and/or product categories e.g.,  

* 15+ salads and grain bowls in core - a large category with good fit that can better address lunch and format variety

* Growth Factor Form penetration to 5% of Factor US customers

* Scale merchandising of add-ons to increase uptake beyond 15% (e.g., across Core, FFL, loyalty program, Programs)





c) Expand audience (TAM) - Focus on dietary preferences and/or health & functional goals e.g.,  

* Launch/expand in 1-2 priority segments (e.g., GLP-1, weight loss, athlete / high-calorie, women’s health)

* Deprioritize declining segments (e.g., Keto)

* Expand into large / athlete portion sizes

* Expand recipe database across nutritional quadrants (high protein/high carb, vs. moderate protein/low carb)

3. Objective: BRING THE BRAND MESSAGE TO LIFE: “ATHLETE-LEVEL QUALITY, DELIVERED TO ALL”

Measure of success:  + [x]% brand buzz, +[x]% aided brand awareness 

Objective Owner:  Marcus von Franck

Investment Type: New    |   HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  3. Brand Reignition 

Description: To win long-term in a fragmented market, Factor must regain cultural relevance and cultivate a great online reputation (which has been core to our struggles to acquire customers in recent periods). Brand must lead with taste, convenience, lifestyle; while reinforcing credibility with nutrition science.

* Sharpen messaging to express “athlete-level quality, delivered to all” with insights from target audiences

* Launch 6 marquee partnerships (celebrity/brand/LTOs) with strong physical product integration, driving halo effects and AOR - spearheaded by local BUs for speed and sharp tailoring to the most high-value audiences and Actives

* Establish protocols to manage reviews/Reddit/community sentiment, and prioritize addressing biggest sentiment drivers (e.g., subscription flexibility and customer service)

* One-off/trial options to broaden audience and improve LTV while reframing subscription as value vs. friction.

* Explore regional marketing teams to execute bold brand and guerrilla campaigns.





4. Objective: SCALE OMNICHANNEL

Measure of success: Factor US: $50M new channels revenue; YFZ: A$85m Retail revenue + profitable business model in FoodService and Institutions

Objective Owner: Adam Park

Investment Type: New    |   HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  6. N/A 

Description: Omnichannel expectations are now the norm and food spend still happens mostly outside DTC. To scale, Factor must show up everywhere — work, retail, foodservice, and providers. Our DTC platform and first-party data can drive demand while new channels expand TAM, strengthen brand, and improve margins.

* Expand Factor for Business (work lunches, employee benefits) 2025: ~$2M; 2026: ~$20M (~$35M ARR)

* Expand Foodservice footprint (e.g., Universities, Hospitality) 2025: ~$1M; 2026: ~$12.5M (~$20M ARR)

* Launch Food-as-Medicine programs 2025: ~$1M; 2026: ~$10M (~$15M ARR)

* Enter 2 key US retailers with fresh meals 2025: $0M; 2026: ~$7.5M (~$15M ARR)

* Expand YFZ retail: 2025: [A$73m]; 2026: A$85m

* Establish scalable supply chain model to support new channels





5. Objective: INTERNATIONALIZATION

Measure of success: Add >€100mm revenue outside of the US (+33%) via scaling Factor EU (+100%), Canada (+30%), and YFZ (+25%), at collective break-even - with trajectory to adding >200mm in 2027 

Objective Owner:  Ed Boyes

Investment Type: New    |   HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  6. N/A 

Description: Scaling RTE outside of the US remains one of our biggest growth opportunities, with an incremental >2bn revenue possible if reaching our current US penetration levels (from current c. 300mm Eur). It will be critical in 2026 to establish the manufacturing footprint, product quality and innovation to lay the platform for realizing this opportunity. 

* Successfully launch and ramp up Verden operations, achieving >3.40 recipe scores, Paid AOR of >6 and >38% mPC2 by H2

* Initiate launch in France, once Verden operations are successfully established

* Grow penetration in Western Canada, following successful launch of manufacturing capability 

* Progress UK entry strategy, including potential strategic partnerships with incumbents









NEXT STEPS

Each BU leader across F_US, F_CA, F_EU and YFZ will develop and present 2026 BU-level yearly plans based on these domain objectives. Specific execution paths may differ or need to be tailored to each market but we should operate within these 5 objectives, and ensure the domain collectively can achieve the target outcomes.
