Fulfillment, Cooking & Logistics Domain 2026

Domain Objectives 

Our primary areas of investment proposed for 2026 are described below by priority. 





1. Objective: Deliver operational process and technology capabilities that enable unconstrained customer experience 

Measure of success:  Ensure capability to fulfill 500 meals is in place in mature BUs by W1 2027, with no mature BU having fewer than 200.

Objective Owner:  Dan Seidel

Investment Type: New     |   HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  2. XL Menu Expansion 5. Efficiency Program/Cost to Serve

Description:  This work will standardize our global fulfillment processes, including technology, and launch new processes that unlock unlimited customer choice as fast as the same day. To get there, we expect to drive:

1. Fulfill 500 Unique menu items out of AZ DC by week 6 2026.

2. Unconstrained Pick Paths: Test and prove which new fulfillment models for kitting and assembly (e.g. Lemon Drop/Cluster Picking), that enable ‘infinite’ selection for customers across >1000 SKUs while maintaining and improving cost per pick.

3. Process and Tool Standardization (Project Highlander): Define the standard to-be process and toolset (Supply Chain Operating System, SCOS) that will drive global operations, enabling quick adoption of best practices and improvements for customers while reducing the total cost of technology to support operations.  

4. Experiment with alternate fulfillment models: Ghost Kitchens, micro fulfillment (in service of 2-6 hr delivery learnings and scaling the RTE business to 500 menu items).

Success here, as we expand menu fulfilment capability and add in more SKUs, is highly dependent on upstream operations improvement in menu planning and demand forecasting, to ensure we have the right ingredients at the right location in a timely manner.









2. Objective: Increase our product-value perception and reality through improving our Perfect Order Rate (POR)[1]

Measure of success:  Improve Group POR from 95.0% (H1 2025) to 96.6%, with no market below 96%.

* NA from 96.4% to 97%; +60bps (in-line with best-in-class - CA & BNL)

* INTL from 93.3% to 96.2%; +290bps (major focus in DE, FR which need to improve ~520bps)

Objective Owner:  Mark Hemming

Investment Type: Existing    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  1. Quality, Packaging and Ingredient SKU innovation 

Description: Group POR has improved from 93.9% in 2023 to 95% in H1 2025 (+110bps). In 2026, to improve this position we will focus on (1) ingredient quality (13.8% of all errors); (2) pick and pack errors (14% of all errors); and (3) undelivered boxes. There are known headwinds in key sites (DE, UK, FR) where we will need to simultaneously increase production volume and improve error rates. Our priorities include:

1. Ingredient Quality: Improve ingredient quality by reducing process lead time (PLT): (Source to Build) Create measurements to accurately capture the dwell time of non-ambient/frozen ingredient SKUs from supplier stock to the box ready to leave the DC. This measurement will enable us to tie customer errors to the total dwell time of SKUs, regardless of where they are in the upstream supply chain or in the production process. (Build to Deliver) Create measurements to accurately capture the dwell time of boxes from the end of production (e.g. waiting to be picked up by a carrier) to a customer’s delivery, including the amount of time in temperature controlled areas vs ambient temperature. 

2. Pick and Pack Quality:  Improve pick and pack errors by 10% to under for existing unique recipe constructs, and proactively build solutions to prevent errors ahead of further recipe expansion. Pick and pack leading indicators (KPI inputs from customers) and the harmonization of this data and reporting internationally from customer feedback (e.g. real-time “and-ons” for procurement and ops) to operational insights and actions will be a foundational component re-examined. Kitting quality will be the first ops actionable priority through “Line Ingredient Accuracy” and a reduction in “Total Kitting Changeovers” (which increased by 38.1% in Q2 from a longer tail of low volume kit recipes), enhanced SKU affinity recipe modeling and coordination across kit lines, kit ingredients replenishment efficiencies, flexi-line enhancements and optimizations, and reduction of grocery cart kitting.  

3. Logistics Quality: Reduce the share of undelivered boxes to 0.5% from 0.65% in INTL and 0.74% in NA (YTD 2025). Undelivered logistics errors make up 7.6% of errors but 27.9% (60M EUR in the trailing 12 months) of error compensation,  with nearly half of these boxes achieving a ‘delivered’ status. We will drive improved visibility for customers and customer care as to the status of their order to improve customer awareness and reduce the need to contact HelloFresh.

4. End-2-End: Revisit and prioritise the existing improvement plans for the two lowest performing markets (H1 2025 DE 90.2; FR 91.3)

5. Leverage the SCOS platform to build standardized, real-time reporting on critical operational KPIs, including inventory levels, labor activity, and production status. This will eliminate the metric inconsistencies that currently prevent true cross-market performance comparisons and targeted improvement efforts.









3. Objective: Industrialize Factor / RTE Cooking Operations for Profitable global scale, without sacrificing quality. 

Measure of success: Reduce NA RTE Cost Per Box from $17.33 (H2B 2025 budget) to $15.89; achieve < 35 LMPB (Total Paid MPB)

Objective Owner: Joanna Hicks

Investment Type: Existing    |   HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  2. XL Menu Expansion 5. Efficiency Program/Cost to Serve

Description: The performance of our Factor operations has been inconsistent, with historical underperformance on cost and customer service. To support profitable growth of RTE globally, we will right size all technical and physical engineering teams to deploy:

1. Successfully launch Verden and within 6 months achieve cost per meal of <1.10 EUR (4.20 EUR marginal PC1) 

2. Expand OEE measurements to all equipment in Factor, including the plating lines, and improve OEE by 20% over 2025 actuals

3. Improve physical design and controls to ensure 14+ day shelf life without preservatives  

4. Industrialize the plating process to ensure the correct culinary experience will be delivered to the customer

5. Reduce Waste 30% over 2025 actuals in RTE 

6. Add new equipment to expand large batch production and reduce the load on ovens and braisers

7. Professionalize and industrialize sanitation to scale with growth and ongoing menu complexity. (reduce number of trays in the valuestream by 30%)









4. Objective: Unlock best-in-class ecommerce fulfillment efficiencies

Measure of success:  Reduce MK Cost Per Box to  < 12 LMPB (Total Worked LMPB) 

Objective Owner:  Dan Seidel

Investment Type: Existing    |   HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  5. Efficiency Program/Cost to Serve 

Description: Our cost to serve has increased driven by several headwinds we are actively mitigating in terms of fixed cost deleverage via lower volumes, order profiles with increased picks per box, greater distribution of lower volume kit recipes and increased kitting line changeovers, and global pricing pressures (tariffs, oil, etc). To counter these, we will:

1. Variable Labour Cost Reduction: Drive and precisely allocate all resources in meal kits and F_ operational processes and workflows to improve hourly throughput with optimal forecasted and realized labor assignments by site and ever more precise allocation of labor every hour across our fulfillment centers. 

2. Central Costs Reduction: Drive the global implementation of a best-in-class Supply Chain Operating System (SCOS) through Project Highlander, standardizing solutions across markets to reduce duplicative tech license spend and the total FTE required to manage supply chain tooling.

3. Network Footprint Utilization Enhancements (Decreased Fixed Costs per Square Foot):          In North America we expect to further improve the overall utilization of our collective sites via driving further operational efficiencies and consolidations of volumes and brands within a strategic core grouping of NA sites as outlined in AEBIT WS3B. These collective initiatives will currently lead to an estimated €17.8M in savings in 2026. In the INTL cluster, footspace reduction will continue with the planned consolidation of meal-kit FC set-up in both UK & DACH.

4. Last Mile: Reduce own last-mile logistics costs by optimizing the DSP model structure, improve driver behavior levers like damage free bonuses, and streamlining vehicle repair cycles.

FAQs





1. Where are the opportunities for GenAI applications in your domain?





We see a significant opportunity in the Analytics space to help operators rapidly analyse performance in their buildings and look for opportunities for improvement.  GenerativeAI may also help us solve a variety of smaller optimization problems that wouldn’t otherwise get attention from our Operations Research team.  We will continue to invest in using GenerativeAI in our configuration interfaces for planning where there have been some early prototypes that show the potential to greatly simplify some digital operations tasks.





* Engineering - Potential Use Cases:

   * Improve testing coverage, especially around edge cases. 

   * Use gGenAI to document well understood integrations (e.g. carriers, or other use cases)

   * An additional opportunity is further expanding our simulation modeling with AI ahead of live pilots.





* Operations Production & Fulfillment - Potential Use Cases:

   * Reduce decision load on the floor -- for example, in Scan2Job, if we could integrate Dynamic Staffing Model (DSM), we could recommend associates to move processes, based on expected labor needs and associate expertise, 

   * Leverage SLMs/LLMs to consolidate disparate data sources, quickly analyze, and interpret into simplified and direct operational recommendations to leaders to audit and fix real time opportunities each hour. 

   * In HL buildings, use GenAI to initially provide recommendations to FlowControllers regarding recommended actions to optimize line performance (based on all real-time data sources), followed by automation of action once recommendations are proven. 





* Data Analysts and Business Insights - Potential Use Cases:

   * Defect identification (e.g. sku sizes, which boxes we should QA based on historical customer, ingredient, or associate issues)





2. What are you doing to improve the customer experience?





Kitchen and Fulfillment operations will translate the HelloFresh “Refresh” strategy into action by streamlining our culinary processes, accelerating meal preparation innovation, and ensuring cost-efficient operations with resilient delivery. Our 2026 domain objectives outline the critical levers we control across the operational supply chain, enabling us to deliver greater variety, deeper personalization, and higher quality while reducing our cost to serve. Specific focus initiatives being driven to enhance the customer experience are outlined above, however, a summary of several of them to deliver a high quality customer experience for RTE are: enhance sleeve print quality, remove preservatives/optimize shelf life, build processes that maintain RTE status, deliver visual and taste quality to the customer that matches the original culinary design, maintain at or above a 3.5 recipe score, obsess over customer defects,  and continue to support menu expansion in line with the MD’s strategy. Meal kits will continue on our path to 500 globally while reducing process lead time to the customer to optimize freshness while obsessing over any defects that may reach the customer.









3. What are the known risks or obstacles to achieving these objectives?





* Leadership must support a cultural shift in our global supply chain operations that may constrain our service model to the customer while continually focusing on reducing our cost to produce a box. The material fulfillment model cost differences we see between markets today (15 LMPB down to 8 LMPB) mean that when we harmonize, it will structurally impact some markets more than others if we do not plan mitigation tactics before roll-out.

   * To that end, we likely need more single threaded leadership org design (across NA & INTL) in some roles. 

* Factor manufacturing in the EU is currently planned to start in January 2026. Critical that this is successful if we are to handle the planned RTE ramp and drive cost efficiency in the EU, at out expected quality bar.

* Operationally there is a clear focus to move towards fulfilment models that unconstrain menu choice & delivery times. There is a risk that as we open up these options, we are not able to leverage commercially if our legacy digital product is not able to monetise (e.g. one-off orders, rather than subscription model; hyper-local fulfilment with super low lead-times).

* There is a clear focus on prioritising work in our mature markets (with US to 500 clearly first), which risks leaving the leaders of new markets and/or brands without support, and encouraging them to find alternate solutions to expand the menu sooner. The team must work with all global MDs to build a mechanism so their voices can be heard and actions prioritized. 

* Many initiatives are positioned as efficiency gains or savings, but without rigorous ROI assessment there is a risk of pursuing “perceived savings” that do not deliver measurable P&L impact. This can divert resources from projects that drive true profitability and operational resilience.





4. What objectives would MDs and other key stakeholders be most disappointed to have left out for 2026? 





* There is no specific priority to drive an enhanced delivery experience proposition.  The primary focus on logistics will be around cost and error reduction. There will likely be some tactical delivery of lead-time propositions (Bolt/NDD) where it makes sense and has very little risk associated, but nothing material.
