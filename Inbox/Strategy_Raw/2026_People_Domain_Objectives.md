# 2026 People Domain Objectives

﻿Domain Objectives

* People Domain 2026





1. Objective: Enable a Reliable, Engaged, and Efficient Front-Line Workforce

Measure of success: Early Attrition Rate (Output Metric) throughout the year we will bring visibility to the adequate input metrics

Objective Owner: Shawn Spanier Philipp BörnerJames Gorman 

Investment Type: Existing 

HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  1. Quality, Packaging and Ingredient SKU innovation 2. XL Menu Expansion5. Efficiency Program/Cost to Serve 

Description: Our objective is to ensure our front-line associates are proud to be part of the HelloFresh team by building an engaged, safe, and reliable workforce. We will enhance the employee experience through consistent HR processes, clear manager expectations, and a focus on safety and respect, all of which will directly improve labor efficiency and cost.

1. Scalable people foundation: In line with operations project Highlander we will seek to establish standards related to Field People including defining operational jobs and career progression, staffing footprint based on building type and size, shift schedules, labor planning approach, employee relations and policy frameworks, etc. to facilitate consistent operating models that scale along with our single operational technology stack. We will standardize only where there is a clear benefit in 1) deploying standard processes and tools for labor planning or 2) solving employee pain points that result in expected enhancement in early retention. 

2. Global Workforce Health Mechanism: We will establish and build on mechanisms to review operational healthiness with a consistent focus on the right workforce mix, attrition, absenteeism, and engagement. We will partner with operations to harmonize  weekly reviews and ensure deliberate action is taken to address pain points with the goal of identifying and quickly solving employee and staffing issues with a repeatable feedback loop. 

3. Global Workday Implementation: We will implement FreshField globally to have 100% of workers in our system. This will facilitate improved visibility into our labor availability, enhanced reconciliation for invoicing of contingent labor, and facilitate better communication with employees through engagement feedback loop touchpoints.

















































2. Objective: Enable a high performance culture and increase our talent density

Measure of success: Regrettable Attrition % of HiPo/Critical roles, Achievement of top 3 talent priorities

Objective Owner: Shawna Fehrman-LeeYasar AhmadSyed Ali Abbas

Investment Type: Existing    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  All 

Description: This objective is about executing on our existing processes with a renewed and clear focus on business impact. Our HRBPs will work with leaders to have clear talent priorities that enable our top 5 strategies. They will partner with our COEs so that our talent processes and rituals are used as tools to bring those objectives to life.  We will achieve this by setting clear expectations, modeling the right behaviors, and providing data to enable accountability. 





1. Defining & Reporting on Business Talent Objectives: HRBPs will spend the rest of 2026 defining concrete talent objectives and the GLT will implement a quarterly reporting mechanism to show progress versus those initiatives. Example initiatives include: Design the target footprint for the MD organization and transition to that footprint by EOY. Implement a multi-location talent strategy to increase the number of Engineers as a percentage of the total tech team population; increasing the number of squads by 10 while maintaining flat headcount. Build a world class food safety team from top leadership to front-line by identifying the right skills and behaviors and executing on an up-skilling roadmap. 

2. Re-focus talent programs, processes and rituals on impact: we will assess the employee journey to identify the bar raising moments and increase our focus on ensuring those are executed well and consistently. This includes ensuring that expectations are clear, leadership is modeling the target behaviors, and accountability mechanisms exist. We will do this for 1. Quality and completion of scorecards 2. Talent Review & Succession Planning 3. Engagement action planning. This will help us elevate our processes and rituals so they are meaningful, human conversations about impact and development rather than just check-the-box occasions. 







3. Objective: Articulate a Global Total Rewards Strategy for Performance, Competitiveness, and Compliance

Measure of success: HiPo-L Retention; Critical Talent Retention

Objective Owner:  Nadia CerisanoSyed Ali Abbas

Investment Type: Existing    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  All 

Description: We're evolving our total rewards strategy to better reflect our maturity as a company; and we aspire to do a great job in communicating the changes throughout 2026 to managers and employees by not just building great frameworks but leveraging our learning team to teach employees and managers about these on an ongoing basis. 



   1. Continue building a performance-driven compensation framework: with a consistent global approach and job architecture, we will implement enhancements to our compensation plan to 1) enhance our ability to recognize top performers with above market pay 2) better align our approach with market practices including further adjustments to our variable compensation program. We will incorporate a Comp 101 into our onboarding and promotion process to ensure all leaders can confidently speak about our compensation programs and drive transparency. We will have a thoughtful strategy to roll out any changes related to compensation. 

   2. Front-Line Pay: assess our current-state front line compensation practices globally and develop a roadmap that enables us to incorporate retention, and pay differentiation based on skills, shifts, and worker type with clear visibility of our direct labor compensation on Cost per Hour in line with our Operations needs. 

   3. Identify opportunities to drive enhanced value beyond compensation: conduct benefits surveys with HR leaders and/or employees and complete an assessment of our benefits practice vs. market across the globe to understand our positioning. Implement one benefit enhancement that provides value to employees in a brand-aligned value (e.g. wage earned access, retirement savings accounts, wellness solutions, tax advantages, etc.) per market by end of year. In the US we will also assess and implement a technology to drive increased engagement with our benefits point solutions and helps us achieve better health outcomes for our employees while bending the trend on our $60m+ healthcare spend

   4. Pay Transparency: ensure compliance with pay transparency and gender pay reporting requirements





4. Objective: Create a Leaner and Faster Organization

Measure of success (Lagging) : AEBITDA/FTE (2025 Actual X, 2026 Target Y); Span of control; Number of Layers

Leading indicators: % of HR cases solved (Tier 0/1) at SLA, Span of Control compliance %, G&A savings contribution

Objective Owner:  Csaba SzendeShawna Fehrman-Lee

Investment Type: Existing    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  5. Efficiency Program/Cost to Serve 

Description: we will create a leaner people team and will also facilitate the creation of a leaner and more effective org for the full organization.



   1. Implement Spans & Layers targets for increased effectiveness: we will implement average span of control requirements and maximum number of layers from the CEO in order to create leaner and more effective orgs. We will incorporate these organizational health metrics into different touchpoints across the org to get to and maintain these targets. A reduction in the number of employees with management responsibilities will increase our agility, improve information flow and decision making and address key engagement pain points. 

   2. Enhancing the headcount planning & budgeting process: we will continue to enhance our global headcount budgeting and planning process to enable 1) workday as the single source of truth for active and planned headcount 2) seamless flow from adaptive into workday and then to greenhouse 3) facilitating a budgeted vs. actual view of our indirect personnel spend including a true up of our forecast. 

   3. Gen AI-Ify our People: We will ensure clear expectations about Gen AI proficiency are embedded across the employee journey, and we will celebrate and cultivate curiosity to use GenAI for efficiency and excellence through our Own Your Growth campaign through 2026. We will build mechanisms to ensure that we measure efficiency gains that come from implementing Generative AI and that a portion of these efficiencies are reinvested into our people. 

   4. Simplification & Scale: We will scale a multi-tier Global SSC to deliver consistent, tech-enabled support at lower cost, freeing HR to focus on strategic priorities that help our leaders refine their operating models and build relevant talent strategies across talent pools that adapt our workforce from where we are today to where we need to be when we bring to life our top 5 ambitions. We will seek to simplify all of our people processes and will streamline FOODIE; introducing continuous feedback and quantitative assessments. We will also implement self-service options for employees and managers focusing on making information and processes simple and accessible, measuring success with a People Process NPS.





FAQs



   * Where are the opportunities for GenAI applications in your domain?

Strategic AI Upskilling & Automation - People Team To shift to an AI-enabled operating model, the People Team is launching two flagship projects, Project Atlas and Project Pulse, to automate repetitive tasks and equip HR with AI capabilities. The goal is to achieve measurable time savings and reduced manual workload by Q1 2026. Project Atlas will identify and quantify the most impactful AI use cases by auditing existing processes to create an "AI Catalogue." Concurrently, Project Pulse will pilot an AI-powered chatbot in select distribution centers by the end of November to automate common employee queries about payroll, PTO, and policies while providing managers with predictive insights. Future Project Pulse initiatives will include a Career Coach, with outcomes to be determined by the findings from Project Atlas. This foundational phase, which includes a process audit by the end of September and an impact review in Q1 2026, sets the stage for a structural realignment of the People function in 2026.



   * What are you doing to improve the customer experience?

Improving the customer experience is a direct outcome of enhancing the employee experience through each domain objective. We want to make sure as a people team we take on the perspective that we are a service to our management team and our employees are our customers. We are defining customer centricity x people in order to ensure we adopt this mindset and build our global people team culture around it. 



      * What are the known risks or obstacles to achieving these objectives?

Known risks include a lack of buy-in for our talent management revamp, operational complexities from global standardization, data silos across different HR systems, and potential budget constraints that could hinder investment in technology investment. We also experience meaningful spikes in unplanned work that may require us to re-prioritize. Additionally, as an organization we are yet to mature in terms of processes, leadership capability, and ways of working. This creates both opportunity for growth and significant dependency on HR, as managers often lack the skills to independently handle people issues, engagement, and grievance management. While standardisation (systems, tools, processes) offers potential benefits, the organisation may not yet be ready; building managerial and organisational capability is a necessary foundation. Without this, HR will remain overstretched, providing compensatory support instead of enabling a more self-sufficient & independently capable leaders & business.



      * What objectives would MDs and other key stakeholders be most disappointed to have left out for 2026? 

         1. Addressing low Foodie budgets and salary bands which are driving top performer attrition 

         2. Improving specific items in performance management and related processes (i.e. ease performance curve restrictions, have more business leader discretion on allocation of Foodie raises and perf grants, simplify Foodie process further, make it more or less )
