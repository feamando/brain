 Customer Engagement & Retention Domain 2026

For 2026, our strategy is built on three parallel workstreams. Our foundational priority is to perfect a meal selection journey for our upcoming 500-meal menu that feels intuitive and personally curated for every customer. Alongside this, we will transform our growth model by attracting a massive, engaged user base to our app with compelling, free-to-use content and tools. A modernized loyalty program will unify these efforts, rewarding engagement across our entire ecosystem to fuel a more sustainable, customer-centric growth engine.





1. Objective: Deliver a World-Class Meal Selection Experience for the 500-Meal Menu

Measure of success: Increase Orders Confirmed from [x] to [y], an increase of [TBC]% 

Objective Owner: Jama Musse

Investment Type: Existing    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  2. XL Menu Expansion 

Description: Expanding our menu to 500 meals allows us to provide sufficient “relevant choice” for every customer segment, across both meal kit (MK) and ready-to-eat (RTE) brands. To unlock this potential and avoid choice paralysis, we will use personalization to create a meal selection journey so intelligent and intuitive that each customer feels the menu was curated just for them. This experience will be powered by an enriched customer profile that combines explicit inputs and implicit signals. Specifically, it will unite customers’ taste preferences (captured during onboarding and editable at any time) and recipe feedback (such as ratings and comments) with a full spectrum of behavioral data, from menu browsing history to ordering patterns. This unified profile will allow us to intelligently rank recipes and engage in tailored merchandising that creates a sense of weekly novelty and discovery, so customers can effortlessly find meals they will love. Nailing this journey of seamless discovery is a critical driver of retention and the foundation of our product-led-growth strategy.

2. Objective: Ignite Daily Engagement to Fuel Our New Growth Engine

Measure of success: Increase daily active users (DAU) for the HelloFresh app from 700k to 5m  

Objective Owner: Evan Weintraub

Investment Type: New    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:4. App Experience  

Description: Our primary long-term strategic bet is to transform our app from a simple order management tool into a daily food companion, a shift designed to compound value across the entire customer lifecycle. To achieve this, we will adopt an audience-first approach by launching buzzworthy, free-to-use features that support customers’ end-to-end food journey—from discovery and planning to cooking and sharing. For example, we'll offer the ability to generate a recipe from a photo of ingredients, automatically generate a smart meal plan based on your tastes, or translate viral social media recipes into accessible cooking instructions[a]. Building our audience first with these tools creates a natural journey for users to become paying customers, facilitated by flexible ordering options such as one-time purchases for app users (including former, existing, and new subscribers) and subscription trials. For those who start ordering, our goal is to make the app a daily habit. We will achieve this by utilizing targeted in-app messaging and merchandising to highlight the most exciting aspects of our weekly menu, and by providing value beyond order management with features such as an interactive, voice-activated cooking companion. Ultimately, this dual focus on broad audience acquisition and deep engagement with our ordering customers will fuel a more sustainable, customer-centric growth engine, thereby increasing retention.

3. Objective: Evolve Loyalty to Reward A Long-Lasting Relationship & Engagement, Not Just Transactions

Measure of success:  Increase the percentage of deliberately redeemed loyalty rewards from ~30% to 80% while ensuring the program generates incremental TCVA

Objective Owner: Edward Day

Investment Type: Existing    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  4. App Experience 

Description: Our loyalty program must evolve into a sophisticated engine for driving incremental TCVA by fostering long-term customer relationships. For 2026, we are sharpening the program's focus to increasing the retention and lifetime value of our settled customers (i.e., post-Box 4). Alongside this refined targeting, we will evolve how the program builds loyalty by incentivizing impactful forms of engagement. While ordering meals will remain the most rewarding action, we will introduce new, lower-cost rewards for actions that are leading indicators of long-term retention, such as rating recipes, posting videos and reviews on platforms like Reddit, TikTok, and Instagram, or engaging with new app experiences. The goal is to help customers maintain a connection with our brand between orders, which we believe will lead to higher loyalty at a lower cost. This program will be the primary mechanism that binds our other objectives together, providing the motivation for the daily habits in Objective #2 and deeper exploration of the 500-meal menu in Objective #1, creating a virtuous cycle of engagement and loyalty.

ID: 2026_GCE_ACT_P3_evolve-customer-loyalty

4. Objective: Build a Proactive Customer Feedback & Reputation System

Measure of success: improve blended sentiment* by 30%  across all platforms 

Objective Owner: Dina Mehrez

Investment Type: New    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  3. Brand Reignition 

Description: Our current approach to customer feedback is fragmented and reactive, leading to missed opportunities and a defensive posture on reputation management. For 2026, we will develop an integrated feedback and reputation system to enhance our public sentiment and scores, fostering a positive, closed-loop experience for our customers. This strategy involves three key workstreams: 

1. We will develop product-led journeys to identify “happy moments” within our app, such as a 4-star recipe rating, and create seamless pathways for satisfied customers to share their positive experiences on public review platforms. 

2. Concurrently, we will enhance our tools, policies, and escalation procedures to better identify and resolve customer issues, aiming to resolve problems before they result in negative public reviews. This holistic approach will transform our reputation from a defensive liability into a powerful asset that drives both customer satisfaction and mid-funnel marketing performance.

3. Create a mechanism to engage our customers on all relevant platforms, including traditional Reputation platforms like Trustpilot, Traditional forums like Reddit, and all the way to TikTok, etc. 

ID: 2026_GCE_ACT_P4_build-customer-reputation-system   





*blended sentiment is a KPI to be developed and takes into account app store sentiment, Reddit sentiment, TikTok sentiment, and Trustpilot sentiment

FAQs





1. What were hotly debated investment priorities that did not make the cut?

To ensure ruthless focus, we deliberately limited ourselves to the stated priorities. Elements of deprioritized objectives may be integrated as features supporting our core goals, but they will not be primary, resource-driving objectives for 2026.





Customer Care: Over 15% of our active customers contact us to report errors, post-cutoff changes, or account issues, making “unhappy path” management critical to retention as our offerings grow more complex. In 2025, we will launch a global chatbot, expand self-serve reporting to all brands with a 50% target, and upgrade agent tooling and our $200M compensation platform. With current resourcing, we believe we can automate most asynchronous scenarios by 2026, significantly reducing agent load while raising CSAT and lowering costs. Given priorities 1–3, Customer Care will remain stable through 2026, with broader automation acceleration considered in 2027.





Variable Pricing: For 2026, we are consciously deferring a full implementation of variable pricing to focus on our most critical priority: solving the foundational challenges of the 500-meal menu. This decision marks a strategic pivot for the pricing domain. After heavily investing in new capabilities like regional pricing and enhanced price testing in 2024 and 2025, our focus in 2026 will shift from building new infrastructure to leveraging the powerful tools we now have. We will continue to validate our hypotheses on the topic of variable pricing by running targeted, low-effort experiments, such as testing new ways to display surcharges.





Subscription flexibility: Improving subscription flexibility is a key part of our long-term vision and a frequent request from our customers. While progress on this topic has been historically slow due to foundational tech constraints, major platform improvements now underway are resolving these core blockers. As a result, initiatives that would have previously taken months of complex, cross-functional work could be delivered as features in substantially less time. For 2026, while subscription flexibility is not a domain objective, we will commit a dedicated team to deliver the most impactful, strategically aligned features (e.g., one-time purchases, non-weekly delivery frequencies, etc.). The size of the investment and the priority of features to build will be determined during Yearly Planning.





Cross-Selling: Not a main priority for 2026. We will learn from the first pilot in Q3 to cross-sell Factor meals for HF-US customers, and then decide on next steps once our plans for 500 meals are fully developed. We also do not plan any changes to the brand setup, such as merging mealkit brands.





RAF (as historically defined): We recognize that our traditional Refer-a-Friend program was a significant area of underperformance in 2025 and that a new approach is required. For 2026, our vision is to evolve RAF from a standalone acquisition tool into a true virality engine, fully integrated into our loyalty program (Objective #3). This shift allows us to reward a broader range of advocacy behaviors beyond a simple referral, making it just one of several ways a customer can earn rewards. This integration is an active and resourced project for 2026, not a deprioritization. The goal is to make all forms of customer advocacy easier and more rewarding, turning our most passionate customers into a more powerful and efficient growth channel.





2. Where are the opportunities for GenAI applications in your domain? GenAI is a critical accelerator for our objectives. It will be key to delivering hyper-personalized discovery and recommendations for the 500-meal menu. For our daily engagement goal, it will power new and innovative content experiences, such as generating recipes from user inputs. While no longer a standalone objective, GenAI remains the core technology for potential future features like search-based discovery, Voice cooking companion or chatbots, which will be evaluated based on their ability to drive our primary objectives.





3. What are you doing to improve the customer experience? We are transforming the customer experience by focusing on three foundational pillars: First, building a best-in-class, seamless, and personalized shopping experience for our expanded menu. Second, evolving our app into a daily-use food companion that provides value to all users, whether they are ordering or not. Third, implementing a modern loyalty program that rewards customers for their engagement with our ecosystem, fostering a deeper, more resilient relationship with our brands.





4. What are the known risks or obstacles to achieving these objectives? Our biggest risk is resource contention, as the talent required to build the XXL menu experience directly competes with the resources needed for new app engagement features. This forces difficult trade-offs between initiatives with short-term, measurable impact and our long-term strategic bet on engagement. Success will require ruthless prioritization and a disciplined, “swarming” approach. At the same time, we are a late-mover in a crowded market of established recipe apps. Winning will require us to ship truly differentiated features, iterate quickly, and execute a strong go-to-market strategy to generate the traffic needed to start our engagement flywheel. Finally, as we innovate, we must carefully manage the impact on our active subscriber base, who make up the majority (ca. 77%) of our daily app users. We face a dual risk of harming their experience through user confusion (e.g., seeing 15k recipes in our archive but only being able to order 500) and sacrificing direct business value by replacing high-performing features, such as the RAF bottom nav entry point, with new engagement tools.

2026 Domain Objectives: Active Customer Experience [b][c][d]

Working G[e]roup/PoCs:

* Driver: Assaf Ronen

* Working Group: Assaf Ronen, Annie Meininghaus, Tilman Eichstaedt, Dina Mehrez, Sebastian Starke, Holger Hammel, Adam Kalikow, Cho Hwang

1. Introduction: From Meal Kit Service to Daily Food Companion

As HelloFresh embarks on its 2026 journey to "Refresh Our Promise" and define the future of food, our success hinges on fundamentally transforming our customer relationships. Our ambition is to evolve beyond the weekly box, becoming an indispensable, daily partner in our customers' kitchens. This transformation is not just an ambition; it is an urgent necessity for returning to growth.

Today, our biggest challenge is customer retention. The average North American customer purchases 5.5 boxes over the course of a year (compared to 5.0 boxes for the international markets), but only 50% reach a second order, and a mere 33% get to a fourth order before cancelling (compared to 66% and 41% for international markets). This reality underscores the need to shift from a transactional service to a vibrant, engaging food ecosystem. These objectives are therefore focused on our most critical lever for returning to sustainable, profitable growth: deepening our daily relationship with customers to drive retention and increase lifetime value.

This document outlines the strategic objectives for the Active Customer Experience domain. We plan to drive daily digital engagement in order to deepen customer connections and cultivate unwavering loyalty. This domain directly supports the company-wide strategic pillars of Daily Customer Engagement and Inspiring Brand & Marketing, ensuring every interaction builds satisfaction and turns customers into passionate advocates. The strategic direction herein will guide the Functional Yearly Plans across Customer Care, Global Actives, NA Product, INTL Product, NA Marketing, INTL Marketing, Growth Alliance, Consumer Services Alliance, MarTech Alliance, and the Actives Journey Alliance.

Domain Objectives 2026

Our primary areas of investment proposed for 2026 are described below by priority.

1. Objective: Ignite App Engagement – The Hub of Our Food Ecosystem

* Measure of success: Increase monthly active app users (MAU) by 300% by EOY 2026.

* Objective Owner: Sebastian Starke

* Investment Type: To be selected

* HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact: Daily Customer Engagement, A Superior Food Experience

* Description: Our HelloFresh app is the primary gateway to our brand and the core vehicle for delivering a superior food experience. To become a "daily food companion," the app must transform from a simple order management tool into an intelligent, central hub for our customers' food journeys. This means making our vastly expanded menu easy to discover and navigate, and using the app to deliver intelligent personalization that tailors recommendations to each customer's unique tastes and health goals. We will introduce new daily experiences, such as generating recipes from a picture of a user's fridge, offering alternate preparations for our meal kits, and providing calorie and health tracking by analyzing photos of meals. This also involves a fundamental shift in our communication strategy towards in-app channels. By making the app an indispensable daily habit—even for non-ordering customers—we will dramatically increase customer stickiness, reduce churn, and create a powerful, direct channel for demonstrating our evolving value. A key supporting metric will be ensuring 70% of active customer communications are programmable and delivered via in-app channels.

2. Objective: Relaunch Our Loyalty Program – Rewarding Relationships, Not Just Transactions

* Measure of success: Drive a cumulative AOR growth of [Target Value], calculated as the number of loyalty members multiplied by a 0.5 AOR uplift.

* Objective Owner: Dina Mehrez

* Investment Type: To be selected

* HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact: Daily Customer Engagement, A Superior Food Experience, Inspiring Brand & Marketing

* Description: Churn remains our single biggest growth inhibitor. A world-class loyalty program is our most powerful tool to combat this. The 2026 relaunch will move beyond simple discounts to build a rewarding relationship with our customers, incentivizing deeper digital engagement, user-generated content, and community. Customers will be rewarded not solely for their spend history, but also for how they engage with us. By systematically encouraging and showcasing this user-generated content, we will generate authentic 'brand heat,' transforming satisfied customers into high-value brand advocates[f]. Supporting metrics include achieving a 5x increase in recipe reviews, generating 500,000 external user-generated videos and 100,000 posts, and driving program adoption to 95% of customers by their second box.

3. Objective: Sustain Engagement for “Non-Box-Week” Customers – Keeping the Connection Alive

* Measure of success: Achieve a 20% monthly active engagement rate among non-box ordering customers.[g][h][i]

* Objective Owner: Holger Hammel

* Investment Type: To be selected

* HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact: Daily Customer Engagement

* Description: Our relationship with customers shouldn't end when they pause their subscription. To remain top-of-mind and facilitate seamless reactivation, our app must provide continuous value. This objective focuses on creating compelling content and features that encourage paused customers to engage with our ecosystem at least once a month. By nurturing this connection, we foster latent brand loyalty and establish a low-friction pathway for their return, supporting our goal of retaining high-value customers for the long term.

4. Objective: AI Concierge – Conversational, End‑to‑End Support[j][k]

* Measures of success:

   * Reduce human-agent tickets per 1,000 orders by 90%.

   * Guide 50% of in-app cooking sessions via Concierge voice or chat by EOY 2026.

   * Ensure 75% of routine tasks (e.g., pause, swap meals) are completed via Concierge self-service.[l][m][n]

* Objective Owner:Tilman Eichstaedt

* Investment Type: To be selected

* HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact: GenAI'fy HelloFresh, Relentless Efficiency

* Description: In 2026, we will launch an AI-powered HelloFresh Concierge that accompanies each customer throughout their entire journey—from account creation and meal selection to providing hands-free, voice-guided cooking assistance. Accessible via real-time chat and voice, the Concierge will blend real-time data and generative AI to deliver personalized, 24/7 assistance. This will not only solve problems but also proactively surface upsell opportunities and inspirational content. Key supporting metrics include having 95% of active customers engage with the Concierge quarterly and maintaining a CSAT of 4.8/5 across Concierge-handled interactions.

5. Objective: Reinvigorate Refer-a-Friend[o]

* Measure of success: Grow the number of settled conversions from the Refer-a-Friend program by 50%.

* Objective Owner:Assaf Ronen

* Investment Type: To be selected

* HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact: Inspiring Brand & Marketing

* Description: Our most passionate customers are our most effective and efficient engine for growth. This objective focuses on reinvigorating our Refer-a-Friend program to systematically convert this enthusiasm into a powerful acquisition channel. By making advocacy easy and rewarding, we aim to significantly increase the share of "settled customers" who join HelloFresh through a trusted recommendation. This not only lowers our overall Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) but also attracts higher-value customers who are more likely to remain loyal.

FAQs

* Where are the opportunities for GenAI applications in your domain?

GenAI is a foundational accelerator for this entire domain. For App Engagement, it will power hyper-personalized content and recommendations. For our Loyalty Program, it will help design personalized challenges and analyze user-generated content at scale. For Customer Care, it is the core technology for the next-generation AI Concierge, enabling higher-quality intent detection, more natural conversations, and providing co-pilot assistance for our human agents.

* What are you doing to improve the customer experience?

We are fundamentally transforming the customer experience by moving from a transactional service to a daily food companion. This is driven by five key initiatives: making our app the central hub for engagement, launching a rewarding loyalty program, keeping paused customers engaged with valuable content, providing an AI-powered Concierge for end-to-end support, and enhancing our Refer-a-Friend program.

* What are the known risks or obstacles to achieving these objectives?[p]

Potential risks include resource constraints in engineering, the complexity of harmonizing initiatives across brands and regions, [q]developing engaging and differentiated content and tools for consumers to engage with, and the need to adapt to evolving customer behaviors. Success requires rigorous prioritization and cross-functional alignment.

* What objectives are you most disappointed to have left out for 2026?

[Placeholder for discussion: e.g., While our focus is sharp, we made the tough decision to postpone a full-scale integration of live cooking classes within the app to ensure we deliver flawlessly on our core objectives first.]

2. Our 2026 Strategic Imperatives for Engagement and Loyalty[t][u]

In 2026, we are setting forth five interconnected objectives designed to revolutionize how customers interact with HelloFresh, forging true partnerships that drive retention and increase lifetime value.

Objective 1: Igniting App Engagement – The Hub of Our Food Ecosystem

Our HelloFresh app is the primary gateway to our brand. To become a "daily food companion,"[v] the app must transform from a simple order management tool into the central hub of our customers' food journeys. This involves a fundamental shift in our communication strategy: moving away from email and towards in-app messaging, notifications, and in-app advertising as our primary channels. By making the app an indispensable daily habit—even for non-ordering customers—we will dramatically increase customer stickiness, reduce churn, and create a powerful, direct channel for demonstrating our evolving value.[w]

* Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

   * Increase monthly active app users (MAU) by 300% by EOY 2026.

   * Ensure 70% of active customer communications are programmable and delivered via in-app channels.[x]

Objective 2: Relaunching Our Loyalty Program – Rewarding Relationships, Not Just Transactions

Churn remains our single biggest growth inhibitor, with a segment of our customer base caught in a "cancellation and reactivation spiral." A world-class loyalty program is our most powerful tool to combat this. The 2026 relaunch will move beyond simple discounts to build a rewarding relationship with our customers. It will be engineered to incentivize deeper digital engagement, encourage the creation of authentic user-generated content, and foster a sense of community. In other words, customers will be rewarded not solely for their spend history, but also how and to what extent they engage with us. This will transform satisfied customers into high-value brand advocates, directly increasing their order frequency and lifetime value.

* Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

   * Increase the Average Order Rate (AOR) by 0.5 for loyalty program members.

   * Achieve a 5x increase in recipe reviews submitted by loyalty members.

   * Generate 500,000 external user-generated videos and 100,000 posts.

   * Drive Loyalty program adoption to 95% of customers by their second box.

Objective 3: Sustaining Engagement for “Non-Box-Week” Customers – Keeping the Connection Alive[y][z][aa][ab]

Our relationship with customers shouldn't end when they pause their subscription. To remain top-of-mind and facilitate seamless reactivation, our app must provide continuous value. This objective focuses on creating compelling content and features that encourage paused customers to engage with our ecosystem at least once a month. [ac]By nurturing this connection, we foster latent brand loyalty and establish a low-friction pathway for their return, thereby directly supporting our goal of retaining high-value customers for the long term.

* Key Performance Indicator (KPI):

   * Achieve a 20% monthly active engagement rate among non-box ordering customers.

Objective 4: AI Concierge – Conversational, End‑to‑End Support

Great support isn’t just about resolving issues; it’s about anticipating needs and guiding customers from their very first click—or even during dinner prep. In 2026, we will launch an AI-powered HelloFresh Concierge that accompanies each customer throughout the entire journey—account creation, box selection, recipe swaps, delivery updates, dietary preferences, refunds, loyalty perks, and re-ordering, and provides hands-free, step-by-step voice cooking guidance and conversation right in the kitchen. Accessible via real-time chat and voice across app, web, smart speakers, and messaging channels, the Concierge will blend real-time data, natural-language understanding, and generative AI to deliver personalized, context-aware assistance 24/7. This always‑on companion will not only solve problems but also proactively surface upsell opportunities, inspirational content, and time‑saving actions, turning friction into delight while reducing service costs.

   * Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

   * • 95% of active customers engage with the AI Concierge (chat or voice) at least once per quarter

• Guide 50% of in‑app cooking sessions via Concierge voice or chat by EOY 2026

• Maintain a CSAT of 4.8/5 across Concierge‑handled interactions

• 75% of routine tasks (pause, swap meals, change delivery, loyalty redemption) completed via Concierge self‑service

• Reduce human‑agent tickets per 1,000 orders by 90%

   * Objective 5: Reinvigorating Refer-a-Friend 

Our [ad][ae]most passionate customers are our most effective and efficient engine for growth. This objective focuses on reinvigorating our Refer-a-Friend program to systematically convert this enthusiasm into a powerful acquisition channel. By making advocacy easy and rewarding, we aim to significantly increase the share of "settled customers" who join HelloFresh through a trusted recommendation. This not only lowers our overall Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) but also attracts higher-value customers who are more likely to remain loyal to us.

   * Key Performance Indicator (KPI):

   * Grow the number of settled conversions from the Refer-a-Friend program by 50%.

   * 3. Conclusion: Building a Future of Engaged, Loyal Customers

These five objectives are not standalone goals; they are an integrated strategy to build a future where every HelloFresh customer feels connected, valued, and excited by our brand. By delivering a dynamic app experience, a truly rewarding loyalty program, intelligent customer care, and powerful community advocacy, we are laying the foundation for sustainable, profitable growth and a significant increase in customer lifetime value for 2026 and beyond.

4. FAQs

   * How do these objectives contribute to HelloFresh Group's overall 2026 strategies?

   * They are the primary drivers of the "Daily Customer Engagement" pillar. They also directly support "Inspiring Brand & Marketing" (through loyalty and referrals), "Relentless Efficiency," and "GenAI'fy HelloFresh" (through the customer care bot).

   * Are there any known risks or obstacles to achieving these objectives?[af]

   * Potential [ag][ah][ai]risks include resource constraints in engineering, the complexity of harmonizing initiatives across brands and regions, and the need to adapt to evolving customer behaviors. Success requires rigorous prioritization and cross-functional alignment.

   * What opportunities for automation or technology investments are there within this domain?

   * Significant opportunities exist in leveraging AI/ML to personalize the app experience, power our loyalty engine, and enhance our customer care bot's capabilities. This is a core part of our "GenAI'fy HelloFresh" strategy.

   * Which objectives are most critical to prioritize for immediate action in 2026?

   * Prioritization will be managed through our quarterly planning cycles and the "Meta Backlog" process, focusing on initiatives with the highest potential for immediate, material impact on our KPIs and alignment with top company-wide strategies.

   * How will we use GenAI to accelerate these objectives?

   * GenAI is a foundational accelerator for this entire domain. For App Engagement, it will power hyper-personalized content and recommendations. For our Loyalty Program, it will help design personalized challenges and analyze user-generated content at scale. For Customer Care, it is the core technology for the next-generation bot, enabling higher-quality intent detection, more natural conversations, and providing co-pilot assistance for our human agents.

   * What changes in infrastructure and data architecture are needed?

   * Achieving these objectives requires significant evolution in our technical foundation. Our Data Architecture must move towards a unified, 360-degree customer view that integrates transactional, behavioral, and support data in real time[aj]. The development of a reliable CLV prediction model is a critical dependency. Our Infrastructure must be scaled to support a 3x increase in app traffic and provide the MLOps capabilities (e.g., access to foundation models, and vector databases) required to deploy GenAI features responsibly and efficiently. This includes consolidating our global customer care tech stack.

[a]In the case where there are ingredients missing from the generated recipes, what would the balance be between partnering with external grocery delivery players to enhance customer convenience, and protecting our business model, including against emerging competitors who might use this route to bypass our asset-heavy meal-kitting advantage? @ew@hellofresh.com

Hello Team, I've tried to morph the doc to meet the domain objectives template and address most of the comments.

[c]@assaf.ronen@hellofresh.com to come back which domain this is covering. if this is mostly about the tech team building apps we need to include XXL menu related investment as highest priority

[d]Just to close the loop on this comment - I talked to Adriana, and we agreed that this paper should cover XXL menu-related investments. I created a v0.2 in a new tab that reflects that input

[e]@assaf.ronen@hellofresh.com @adriana.villar@hellofresh.com 

@ew@hellofresh.com 

I suggest to remove the tab to avoid confusion (for humans and AI ;) (I cannot do that)

[f]UGC fits much more in 3 for me. Loyalty is the reward system

[g]for the debate: this still feels like a sub-goal to #1. #1 will likely not be achievable if we dont crack engagement in the cohort of prospects, paused and former customers. we are starting the modeling process to look at this but let's quickly debate if it's effective for this to split this out and have a different owner etc

[h]in particular since after first discovery parts the features are largely overlapping with the general quest for DAU

[i]This is a good question - engagement for subscribers, and customer who are not

[j]do we track drastic improvement in service level, error reduction and delivery experience? That is pretty important for active customers and probably in the top 5 churn reasons today with errors rates > 10% in some markets

[k]yes, but that will be focus for the respective Ops teams for sure. Only thing we could consider here is providing better and more granular data, e.g. pictures on quality laps

[l]assuming it's the approach preferred by customers, but for these rather habitual tasks, customers might be inclined to sticking to clicking on the actions instead of engaging with an Agent. perhaps some UXR is warranted first to confirm?

[m]if we find better ways to do that , with self service we will adjust - but the direction is to let customers use self service

[n]yes fully agree, self-service first, was just wondering whether "click-based" or "agent-based" self-service is the way forward, but then realized it's not that material, we can offer both and let the customer decide how they want to self serve.

[o]remove

[p]i'd argue the biggest risk is pressures on the P&L forcing us to move away from growth via engagement and back to growth via discounts and adhoc short term mitigation measures.

[r]so physical product is in here too? in that case I suggest a prominent objective on menu & food quality so that we offer the right things to customers, talk about the expansion and choices, ingredient quality etc? food is our product so want to make sure it get's the right spotlight when we talk active customers.





where do we talk about topics like delivery experience and errors that need to drastically reduce for long-lasting engagement? where do we best talk abut service quality like cut-off times, delivery windows, box cancellation policies + leniency etc

[s]I don't separate physical and digital - I separate food from experience

[t]for discussion to decide how to best place this. how do we bring in our plan to evolve our monetization model? higher flexibility around our service is important and trialing out new models. given how many fundamentals we are challenging this through our monetization model plan i'd love to recognize this prominently in here as investment for next 12 months to find new winning models

[u]isnt it more suitable with objective 3 ?

[v]stating the obvious -- we'll need to align on what this really means and involves

[w]Very supportive, huge opportunity!





Do we want to unlock engagement beyond transaction and messaging? Engage Customers to manage their dietary aims, or their family dinner cooking and purchasing plans? Or win prices, add-ons via simple games, ....

(I would see a lot of benefit there! Potentially also acquiring existing apps and integrating them.)

[y]This is not MECE with Objective 1. I think we can combine the two by nesting the objective 3 KPI under objective 1.

[z]+1 to merge, that is part of the same objective

[aa]Probably worthwhile to consider merging the two, as a lot of means and steps will be similar, but likely not all.

[ab]I want this to be very explicit, so we can measure

[ac]Yes! See above, lot's of opportunities from Planning to Gaming - Question for me is Make or Buy

[ad]maybe not for this stage in the process, but the "how" will be worth discussing here. It's not just about optimizing incentives for referrals. I'd argue more for mechanisms that cultivate organic engagement and sharing to build community and more natural word of mouth

[ae]If we become the world's food social media, where people post recipes, outcomes, and reviews, we will also be able to have people follow each other, etc.

[af]I would include our experimentation playbook.  We need to have faster experiment cycles e.g. - from 10 weeks to 4 weeks, to create velocity.  Simply put, our lead time to statsig is too long.

[ag]what about engaging content or resources that make it worthwhile to visit the app everyday? Yes we can use AI for content, but so can everyone else

[ah]YES - add it

[ai]added to top section

[aj]@sebastian.starke@hellofresh.com let's discuss current and future state of CDP with Bjorn and Jal. I'm not concerned about real-time transactional data but I am curious about moving to a composable CDP for long term simplicity.
