💡 Meeting Notes [To be filled after the Review Meeting by the YP Document Owner and sent out via email to attendees. This section does not impact the maximum number of pages]

Review Meeting Date: Oct 16, 2025

Key Takeaways, Decisions, and Next Steps:

1. Alignment needed with Adam Park on plan for Factor Programs, as it fell below the line for Q4 and Q1. Does this need to be reprioritized? Done, we have agreed to keep momentum on physical product as well as planning ahead of Q2 development relaunch 

2. Factor Tech prioritization list created by Adam Park needs to be reviewed against the backlog of the MD squad. Done, we have reviewed the incremental asks, and have pulled them into Ed squad prioritization, and flagged items already in YP’s 

3. Lack of analytics resourcing was highlighted as risk for New Ventures, Annie and Jama to take away and come back with Analytics resourcing plans for New Ventures We have added 1 incremental PA resource to the New Ventures domain space, and will be looking to move additional temporary capacity to reduce the outstanding backlog 

4. Factor Form should better connect their products to customers  goals to create a “personalized performance stack”. Jama to connect with Adam Park on this plan We have added this for exploration in Q3 plan 

5. An aligned strategy should be created on how Loyalty should work for the New Ventures, and should this connect to the New Loyalty strategy set to launch in Q2-Q3 We will be looking to leverage the New Loyalty program when it launches, so we have therefore moved loyalty for Pets Table back by 1 quarter into Q3   

6. Cross Selling for other brands outside of HelloFresh and Factor is below the line for 2026 to be revisited for 2027 planning









Changes requested to the Yearly Plan during Draft Reviews. Please update before submission for final YP approval:  

* Move Loyalty on Pets Table by 1 quarter to Q3 to leverage  New Loyalty program launch 

* App Launch for Pets Table to become contingent on results of Elysium and ABBA app launches (both financial and performance KPIs)

Key Deliverables

2026_CO_NV_P2_pets-table-increase-customer-retention

In 2026 The Pets Table will offer US consumers the widest assortment of healthy pet food, addressing audiences often overlooked by premium-focused competitors by offering a new product line - Pantry Fresh, enabling customers in Q1 to mix multiple products together - crafting a tailored pet food plan, in Q2 the team will move beyond simple food supply towards supporting pet engagement and care with the TPT Mobile App, addressing the need of 43% of TPT customers looking to have a stronger bond with their pets through feeding and care reminders and additional guidance, further personalization of their plan and service experience and rewarding them with pet care rewards through a loyalty program centered on their pet, and encouraging them to discover new toys and treats to pamper and entertain their dogs within the The Pets Table pet supply marketplace experience and, finally, offer guidance and inspiration on how to care for their dog and build richer and more fulfilling relationships with their dog through providing an application encouraging owners to spend quality time with their dog through bonding and play tips and nudges, embarking on “all things for your dog” journey for The Pets Table brand.





2026_CO_NV_P1_good-chop-grow-subscription-revenue

The existing Good Chop model continues to be a common complaint for customers, due to its restrictions and limitations in allowing customers to enjoy a true butcher experience, in Q4/Q1 the Good Chop team will deliver a scaled One-Time Purchase experience across prospective, former and active customers - enabling them to buy custom protein boxes when they truly need them; allow menu experimentation to provide customers greater purchase flexibility of their desired cuts; followed in Q2 by an overhaul in how the Good Chop subscription functions - getting rid of rigid box sizes, plans and static cut selection restrictions - building a true e-commerce and marketplace experience that customers expect. In 2026 Good Chop will address the limitation that we have historically been a feature/transaction-focused brand, while 2025 key market trend is that customers are increasingly interested in greater understanding of sourcing, nutrition and convenience from their suppliers, with 40% of US customers actively seeking US-made label products . In Q3/Q4 we will begin delivering on the promise of increasing Good Chop transparency to customers,  focusing on providing customers information about our sourcing and quality, encouraging menu exploration through merchandise widgets, premium swaps and delivering inspirational recipes and content on educational content with brand partners, beginning the transition of Good Chop towards a lifestyle brand. 





2026_CO_RTE_P2_expand-meal-choices

Factor Form leans into Factor as a lifestyle brand expanding the assortment beyond meals into new product categories (e.g. meal replacement shakes, whey protein, hydration products, etc.) and further cements Factor as the customer’s all-in-one nutrition partner. To truly support Factor customers on their wellness journey, Factor Form will in Q1 be integrated natively into the Factor App experience and in Q2 offer customers complete e-commerce marketplace experience - enabling individual product purchases, diverse carts and richer product marketing. In the latter half of 2026, as Factor Form expands its assortment, Factor customers will be offered personalized Factor Form plans and entry points, actively supporting them on their journey to health and health. This will allow Factor to tap into new customer segments like athletes and serious health enthusiasts, while guiding beginners on their first steps into a better future.





 2026_CO_MK_P3_increase-menu-excitement

The creator economy represents a fundamental paradigm shift in food media in the last decade, with 70-80,000 influencers in the US alone driving billions of views in a $250B market and 67% of young adults making food decisions based on influencer recommendations, and this is outside of mammoth recipe hubs such as Spruce Eats & NYT Cooking. Yet, this massive market continues to lack the infrastructure to bridge the digital-to-physical gap for their followers. HelloFresh is uniquely positioned to solve this dual-sided problem with our core competency in food logistics at scale—an end-to-end recipe fulfillment capability. Our vision is to become the essential enabling platform for the food creator economy, empowering thousands of creators to launch their own direct-to-consumer brands on our infrastructure. The Second-Party Recipe Marketplace is the first critical step, offering a turnkey solution that provides influencers with a direct, brand-relevant revenue stream while giving their followers a frictionless path to turn viral recipes into successful home-cooked meals delivered by HelloFresh.

	2026_CO_RTE_P2_expand-meal-choices

	Grow Factor Form penetration rate to 5% of Factor US customers.

	Nikita Gorshkov

	Jun 30, 2026

	Factor Form expands meal choice of Factor customers by extending the assortment beyond meals into meal replacement shakes, supplements, etc., introducing a lot of variety and novelty for Factor customers. However, Factor Form penetration rate of Factor US customers today is 0.7%.

	2

	2026_CO_NV_P1_pets-table-launch-new-dog-food-products

	Increase TPT Plans to Conversion Rate from XX% to YY% (+XX%).

	Nikita Gorshkov

	Mar 31, 2026

	By introducing a new Product Line (Pantry Fresh) and new Recipes, the plan selection for TPT should enable greater flexibility of plan composition, mixing functionality and recommendations, resulting in improved ease of use; but excluding the LP -> Quiz conversion calculation we eliminate LP/Marketing variability from the calculation; directly driving DO #1.

	3

	2026_CO_NV_P2_pets-table-increase-customer-retention

	Increase TPT WAU across from XX% to YY% (+XX%).

	Nikita Gorshkov

	Jul 31, 2026

	In order to increase predicted AOR, the team will engage into expanding the functionality and experience of TPT that would drive a desire for weekly engagement with the brand.

	2026_CO_NV_P1_good-chop-grow-subscription-revenue

	 Increase GoC “plans” to Dashboard conversion rate from XX% to YY% (+ZZ%)

	Nikita Gorshkov

	Mar 31, 2026

	Pending the success of improving the GoC Perfect Order Rate in Q4 the team will focus on driving growth through a string of initiatives aimed at driving topline box counts: OTP for New/Active customers, E-commerce Experience/Planless subscriptions, RAF & Reactivation improvements.

	5

	2026_CO_NV_P1_good-chop-grow-subscription-revenue

	Increase customer-driven order meal choice rate from XX% to YY% (+XX%)

	Nikita Gorshkov

	Jun 30, 2026

	As Good Chop transitions towards a new positioning, away from a discount and transactional model of customer engagement; focusing on cut quality and sourcing; encouraging menu discovery and exploration, we expect that customers will actively select their cuts, ensuring boxes and cuts tailored for their needs.

	6

	2026_CO_MK_P3_increase-menu-excitement

	Achieve $100,000 in incremental Net Revenue through second-party sourced recipe boxes.

	Nikita Gorshkov

	Mar 31, 2026

	As the team delivers the PoC of the second-party recipe OTP boxes for CA customers, the objective would be to ensure a strong growth in Net Revenue early on, to identify product market fit.

	IV. FAQs





1. What were the hotly debated deliverables/big rocks that did not make the cut? I.e. what's below the line?

Due to resource swarming for P500 and DAU:

1. We moved the former RTE Expansion squads into DAU and Shopping experience teams. This led us to deprioritize Factor Programs improvements, and put programs on KTLO. We have in the past weeks improved the initial offering, and have created a” Programs” to “Classic Factor” off boarding experience for customers looking to end their program. 

   1. Proposal: Move Programs to the Shopping Guidance squad who we believe can pick up the Active customer experience improvements in Q2 and then build out our bundling/3rd party offering in H2 of 2026.

2. The planned further expansion of cross-selling into additional brands, markets and models (e.g. OTP model of cross-selling) has been scaled down, with no plans for The Pets Table/Good Chop cross-selling of boxes currently planned for 2026.  

   1. Proposal: Move the scope of cross-selling of TPT and Good Chop into the roadmaps of respective team brands, with the objective to evaluate cost/benefit for the new experience within Q3/4 2026. 









2. What did you achieve already in 2025, and what are your remaining deliverables? 

                 The team has successfully delivered against several key objectives for 2025 defined below: 

* Factor: Launched New Integrated Factor Mobile App, Handed over Factor to Core teams, Launched Factor Programs MVP, Launched Trial Box for Factor Form.

* HelloFresh:  Launched Cross Selling MVP Experience.

* Good Chop: Migrated to Wallet Technology, Delivered Cut Details and Search in Funnel, Launched Mobile-Friendly Cards in Funnel/Menu Display, 

* The Pets Table:  Launched New Cadences, Unblocked Menu Expansion through Optimized SKUs, Launched Allergy Capture & Presentation, Enabled Changing Daily Calories.





 Remaining deliverables for 2025 include: 

* Factor Form: Multiple Cadences for Items (week 44), One-Time Purchase (week 48).  

* HelloFresh: Occasion-based Boxes (week 44).

* Good Chop: One Time Purchase in Funnel (week 50), Charge at Checkout (week 46), Reactivations (week 52)

* The Pets Table: Reactivation Experience (week 43), Charge at Checkout (week 48), Price Test for The Pets Table (week 50).

                               

   3. What were your biggest misses and learnings in 2025? Are there any setbacks and lessons to propel growth and success in the future?

Scaling Factor Form, while maintaining the HF subscription-based infrastructure has posed a significant drag in 2025 as our BAU tools, configurations and services are poorly suited to a vertical where customers expect complete flexibility in their purchasing; coupled with struggles in achieving product market fit in some of the spaces this has resulted in underperformance of the sub-brand in 2025. For Good Chop, similarly, the application of certain broad solutions such as Wallet, Free For Life has resulted in significantly higher technical debt costs for the team, hindering the ability to innovate on the product at the velocity needed to compete (new processes and changes to the data models proposed in 2026 address the capacity of the team to drive change within core systems). 





Finally, ongoing issues with processing payments from customers continue to hinder the performance of the brand and have been slow to be addressed due to the inability to identify a clear root cause of performance degradation





   4. What are the known risks or obstacles to achieving your 2026-YP?

Our biggest risk for our New Ventures in 2026 continues to lie in our back end infrastructure and data model. As these continue to be modelled after a weekly Mealkit Subscription, leading to 2 key point of failure for New Ventures: (1) Increased complexity as we add new “products” instead of recipes creating unsustainable SKU permutations, limiting the number of products/variations we can sell; (2) Lack of true ecommerce selling features (true OTP features such as tiered and item pricing) leading to a disadvantage of our brands for customers comparing us to the flexible models and offers on the market and forcing us to contort offers to static box sizes.

	Q4 Key Deliverables

	Q1 Key Deliverables

	Q2 Key Deliverables

	Q3 & Q4 Key Deliverables

	The Pets Table[h][i][j]

	O1

	Run a Price Elasticity Test 

Current TPT pricing model is inconsistent for some customers (cheaper plans/cadences being more expensive etc.) as well as TPT is becoming uncompetitive with the price compared to certain competitors, we will test a new pricing model with broadly lower prices for all customer groups.





	Launch Pantry Fresh Product Line

The new convenient, yet delicious fresh plan for TPT will be launched in early April with three available recipes, ensuring the SKU setup, infrastructure is in place is imperative. 

	Launch The Pets Table' Mobile Application

The mobile application will enable the brand to communicate more effectively with the customers offering them a more personalized, guided experience through using existing communication capabilities with mobile apps. 

	Integrate HelloFresh Rewards into the TPT Loyalty Program tied with RAF

Rewarding customers that continue to purchase with The Pets Table with gifts and rewards that they truly enjoy is imperative to ensure their continued engagement with us, as they would feel appreciated and cared for, combined with viral RAF loops through tiers and rewards would provide further value to customers.

	O2

	Allow customers to Adjust Daily Calories

Customers right now have to go through a complicated and unwieldy process to increase or decrease their daily calorie intake for pets, we aim to make this a single step process. 

	Revamp Plan & Recipe Selection Experience

With the rollout of the new Pantry Fresh product line and recipes, the recipe and plan selection, mixing experience of TPT becomes too complicated for customers to effectively navigate, resulting in a decreased CR, we will address this through a new guided unified experience.  

	Improve Multipet Checkout Enabling Customers to Craft Subscriptions for All of their Dogs





Allow customers to easily (without going through multiple repetitive flows) craft subscriptions for households quickly and confidently.

	Personalization: Images, Pet Wellness Questions, Diary & Reviews

Give customers the ability to offer feedback on plans and recipes, upload pictures of their pup and ask questions about poet health goals and targets, powering future personalizations and recommendations. 

	O3

	Rollout Charge@Checkout

Historically TPT had been charging at checkout, but after the move to UPM we have adopted the charge at the cutoff approach for HelloFresh. This leads, at least for MR and KN, to a decreased AR, moreover with pre-checkout menu selection this is inconsistent with other e-commerce stores' experience. 

	Give Customers the Ability to Discover and Purchase Valuable Services offered by The Pets Table

Customers should be able to discover, benefit and purchase from the full range of added-value services and products: Add-ons, Subscribe & Save, One-Click Purchases.

	Express Checkout - Skip Quiz & OTP Experience

Simplify the ability of customers to sign up for TPT quickly as a guest, buy and subscribe to boxes and quantities of pet food they feel they need. 

	Reinforce the Customer Purchasing Decision through an Improved Funnel Experience

Improve the funnel experience through greater personalized questions, depth, information and statistics, reinforcing The Pets Table’s commitment to the care and wellbeing of the customer’s pets.

	Good Chop[k][l]

	O1

	Release One-Time Purchase in Funnel

Good Chop is uniquely positioned to benefit from OTP the most, as it is the closest to a classic MOV-based e-commerce store where customers can come in and purchase proteins and boxes in sizes and quantities they see fit. 

	Rollout OTP Purchases for Actives and Former

The existing long-cadence subscription plans are not supportive of multiple customers occasions, parties and guests and we are missing around 20% of customers looking for a quick and delicious solution to their protein needs which will be addressed through OTP boxes for actives.

	Deprecate Plans and Launch the E-Commerce Experience

Removing the plans for Good Chop has been a long term ambition and goal for Good Chop - enabling customers to create and customize boxes and cuts in combinations current plans and set box sizes don’t allow or where they impede customers to buy what they want. 

	Shopping Experience: Product Marketing & Merchandising Widgets

We aim to move Good Chop from a transactional and feature-based communication with customers to inspiring them to cook with our products, this will be done through targeted campaigns and rich media and widget throughout the shopping experience. Engage in partnerships and a content strategy.

	O2

	Rollout Charge@Checkout

Customers going through the pre-checkout meal selection are expecting the behaviour of a standard e-commerce store, rather than being charged sometimes 2 weeks post the transaction event, leading to suspected fraud and AR degradation.





	Marketplace Experience/Shopify on Good Chop

Good Chop aims to experiment with the new models, proteins and setups (e.g. SKu-level subscriptions); which can be enabled rapidly through a headed e-commerce platform on Shopify.

	New Dashboard Release: Future Boxes, Add-on Upselling, Premium Swaps

We aim to encourage customers to explore the Good Chop menu through upselling of deals, add-ons and complimentary meals, proposing premium meal swaps and highlighting items that they might have missed from their last visit.

	Recommend Complimentary Products for Customers Exploring the Menu

We aim to introduce product pairings for customers; recommending new combinations of Items that would pair well with their protein selections.

	O3

	Release Menu Experimentation Framework

Enable customers to find the cuts they truly want, and not feel misled because certain cuts are behind surcharges; through enabling multiple variations of the menu, quantities, cut limitations and surcharge composition for Good Chop.

	Deliver a Rewarding Referral Experience for Good Chop Customers

Offer real referral rewards to customers on Good Chop, through credits, free cuts and add-ons, encouraging invitation and gifting behavior.

	



	



	Factor Form

	O1

	Launch One-Time Purchase for Factor Form Peak

Ensure that customers can purchase Factor form assortment as OTP prior to peak, especially as this is the core expected purchasing option within the vertical. 

	Launch Factor Form in Factor Native App Experience in Funnel

Offering Factor Form on a shared platform makes it easier for Factor customers, but we are not meeting the needs of new customers (conversion rate for Factor customers is 2-3% vs <1% for new customers), and our existing tech stack has made it very challenging to grow a plug-and-play e-commerce. Meanwhile, Amazon has become our breakout channel in just four months (35% of channel mix, $15 CAC). Growing Factor Form to the next level requires meeting customers where they are. In 2026 we will experiment sending paid traffic to platforms such as Shopify, Tiktok Shop, and other online marketplaces that provide a plug-and-play feature set catered to supplements.

 Factor Programs addresses monotony by introducing a different way for customers to engage with our offering. While the needs of most customers preferring flexibility and convenience are addressed through our flagship RTE offering, Programs offer a white glove service for customers with specific goals by being their nutrition coach: taking care of all their meal occasions (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks), offering educational content, and helping the customer stay on track through nutrition tracking. We achieve this by offering a seamless meal selection experience for Programs customers: personalizing meal plans based on the customer’s nutrition intake, allergies, preferences; making it easy to modify preselected meals while still meeting customer’s very specific goals, and allowing customers to easily log/import non Factor meals. All of these capabilities should also be offered on the native app (today Factor Programs is only available on web).

While millions of customers receive high-level guidance from dietitians, trainers, and apps, the burden of executing that plan still falls on the individual. Execution is hard: they must interpret and grocery shop based on macro guidelines, meal prep is time intensive and error prone, consistency is difficult to maintain, and tracking is often disconnected from the plan itself. Factor Programs can close the loop by allowing trusted fitness, health, and nutrition recommenders to seamlessly prescribe Factor-curated meal programs to their clients, with execution, fulfillment and tracking handled by Factor. We plan to build integrations to allow partners to easily enter client details  and refer them to Factor Programs.

ARCHIVE





Our strategy to reach 5M daily active users (DAU) is to transform the HelloFresh app into a daily food companion. We will begin by attracting a new, broad audience with compelling, free-to-use tools. This audience-first strategy kicks off in Q4 2025 with the Social Recipe Bridge MVP, which allows app users to transform inspiring recipes from social media into a personal cookbook. In Q1, we will enhance the Social Recipe Bridge by improving our recipe parsing AI and introducing new import methods. As our user base grows, our Q2 focus will shift to creating a sticky, daily-use experience with the launch of the Discovery Hub, a personalized screen that surfaces a wide range of relevant and inspiring food content. For the second half of the year, we will focus on helping users express their creativity, avoid food waste, and tailor recipes to their household's tastes by introducing new recipe creation and customization tools.

Concurrently, we will deepen engagement with our subscribers by embedding the app into their daily cooking journey. Our first step in Q4 2025 is to introduce a simple Meal Planner that allows users to schedule their meals for the week. This creates timely communication opportunities; for instance, we can remind them on Tuesday to check pantry ingredients for a Wednesday meal, and on Wednesday ask if they are ready to start cooking. In Q1, we will double down on improving the cooking experience itself by launching an AI Cooking Assistant that helps users bring recipes to life. Besides showing step-by-step instructions with videos, it will help users with ingredient swaps, timers, troubleshooting and even splitting instructions between multiple chefs. To drive long-term habit formation, in Q2 we will introduce gamified Cooking Programs to give our users a clear sense of achievement and progression. Our strategy for the second half of the year is to then radically reduce friction around meal planning, culminating in the launch of solutions like a one-click and collaborative meal planner for households.

With a compelling app experience for both subscribers and free users, our next step is to ignite organic growth through new viral loops. Our strategy begins by making HelloFresh a natural part of the conversation on external social platforms. We will tap into our users' desire for accomplishment by making it easy and rewarding for them to share photos of the meals they create. Later in the year, we will build on this by offering tools within our app that help anyone create influencer-worthy food content for their social channels, turning consumers into creators. This focus on driving app downloads and daily engagement represents a strategic pivot for virality at HelloFresh. It replaces the historical focus on using referrals to drive direct subscription conversions. Consequently, we will hand over ownership of the legacy Refer-a-Friend (RAF) program to the Growth mega-alliance in Q1, allowing them to independently focus on generating settled conversions. In Q4, we will provide operational support for the RAF commercial team while preparing for a smooth transition, including making management of the RAF program self-serve.

[a]all markets and brands (including HF /.Factor) ?

[b]CA and ANZ live by Week 46, US live in Q1, all other markets live by early Q2. The scope was HF and Factor, but could easily be expanded to all brands

[c]we didn't get to this in the other meeting but I'm still trying to find a POC who will help us build the seasonal box roadmap for 2026. It also came up in the physical assortment YP yesterday @jama.musse@hellofresh.ca

[d]@anne@hellofresh.com Theresa Stolberg has begun conversations with the markets this week for 2026, we will work with her on the plans there.

[e]_Marked as resolved_

[f]_Re-opened_

Why does it need to be country by country and not a global launch ?  

Voice dictated by Assaf

[g]The technology is available globally, the rollouts are happening as the countries define their occasions and setup and procure the SKUs.

[h]what would you like to see here but aren't right now? @lgui@thepetstable.com

_Assigned to lgui@thepetstable.com_

[i]1. Multipet checkout improvements (direct impact on improving AOR)

2. Increasing add on % of net revenue through add on subscribe & save, product marketing & UX (goal to increase add ons as a % of NR from 1% to 5% in 2026)

3. Other CVR initiatives e.g. testing other qus in the quiz (previous pet food, neutered/spayed, etc), personalised value reinforcing stats, etc

4. RAF initiatives on Tiered credit based on loyalty; RAF social proof & CVR improvements -> one of our goals for 2026 is to step change RAF





The team have this long list of initiatives and we will prioritise them through our quarterly planning.





The key thing is that we are resourced to tackle the vast majority of these and we've aligned on the resourcing for that. I can share with you in our call on Tuesday

[j]Aligned with Laurent on this, we have a good understanding of the overall capacity needs with the team based on the available initiative roadmap; this particular table/format was not aimed to be exhaustive of all of the work we aim to deliver in 2026.

[k]whats most painful to see not on the list @yt@hellofresh.com @set@hellofresh.com

_Assigned to yt@hellofresh.com_

[l]all key topics are in here. 





one stream that's not present in here but we have as part of objectives and currently actively exploring is modernized CX leveraging AI: we are now looking at a few solutions that would augment CC, support sales funnel with live Q&A as well as retention flow (i.e. replace cancellation flow with native chat experience and go off the cancellation reason - solution) - this would need team support (data ingestion, PM steering, etc)
