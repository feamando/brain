Frequently Asked Questions : 





   1. Where are the opportunities for GenAI applications in your domain?

Automated Business Insights & Decision Velocity: Expanding GenAI-driven reporting pilots across all channels and geographies to reduce manual monitoring and accelerate decision-making. This includes automating campaign diagnostics, creating narrative-ready insights, empowering teams with AI-driven alarming thresholds, and integrating conversational analytics tools for self-service analysis. Cross-market benchmarking to flag under/overperformance and recommend reallocations. Forecasting copilots for scenario planning (e.g., “What if we cut Google spend in DE by 10%?”). Social listening + web scraping to surface real-time cultural trends, competitive moves, and creative inspiration.

Personalized Customer Journeys at Scale: Scaling AI/ML to deliver one-to-one personalization across acquisition, retention, and reactivation. This covers dynamic content generation, tone and imagery adjustments, predictive send-time/channel optimization, and preference-based menu recommendations (e.g., best sellers, “new this week,” friend-ordered items). Predictive churn signals that flag at-risk customers earlier and trigger targeted journeys. Journey stitching across CRM + Paid to avoid siloed follow-ups.

Hyperlocal personalization (e.g., recipes, offers, or local partner content by market). Conversational commerce (chatbots in app/WhatsApp) that upsell, cross-sell, or resolve objections in real-time.

Experimentation & Testing Efficiency: Using GenAI to design experiments, automate QA, flag contamination, and accelerate rollout of learnings across channels (e.g., nested tests, synthetic controls, and always-on incrementality testing).

Workflow Automation – Automating repetitive tasks across Growth, CRM, and Paid (e.g., campaign QA, translations, reporting, landing page updates, and capacity planning), freeing talent to focus on strategic initiatives.

Creative Development Acceleration: Streamlining ideation, storyboarding, and asset variation through GenAI while ensuring speed, authenticity, and brand consistency. Applications include subject line/content variants, localizations, and high-volume content for influencers, partnerships, and SEO. Social listening, web scraping for rapid creative development ideation, reduction in briefing timelines. Using Influencer briefs auto-generated from past campaign performance. Build High-volume creative variation for TikTok, Meta, partnerships, and SEO. Co-branded partner assets drafted instantly, reducing bottlenecks in B2B/Retail Media campaigns.





   2. What are you doing to improve the customer experience? 

Rebalancing Growth Drivers: Transitioning from discount-led acquisition/reactivation to product innovation and quality-led storytelling. This means embedding food quality, menu expansion, and differentiated product experiences (e.g., new SKUs, cross-brand bundles) directly into CRM, referrals, and paid channels, giving customers stronger reasons to choose our brands.

Elevating Creative & Advertising: Driving relevance and engagement by embedding continuous creative testing, insight loops, and format innovation into how we advertise. Examples include partnership ads (Meta/TikTok), gamified referral mechanics, and integrated product-led narratives across influencers and affiliates.

Personalized Journeys Across Channels: Building seamless, cross-channel experiences that combine app, CRM, and paid touchpoints into one tailored journey. This includes integrating referrals into loyalty, embedding reactivation offers into app/product flows, and using AI to dynamically steer messaging mix.





   3. What are the known risks or obstacles to achieving these objectives?

Measurement of Brand Investments: MMMs and geo-tests do not capture long-term brand equity effects. We are building new frameworks to link brand KPIs (awareness, consideration) to financial metrics (CVA, CLV), but interim decisions will require conviction-based brand investments.

Data Quality & Fragmentation: Privacy regulation, lack of a unified source of truth, and fragmented data-sharing reduce the accuracy of DDA, mROI, and AI models. Dependencies on third-party platforms/vendors (e.g., Haus, Iterable, CDPs) create scalability and compliance risks.

Operational & Tech Dependencies: Marketing execution remains constrained by inconsistent campaign setup (e.g., CRM tooling, discount recommender rollout, Iterable migration), limiting speed to market and scalability of AI-driven personalization.

Competitive Landscape: Rivals with aggressive performance spend and diversified models (e.g., Hungryroot, Blue Apron) threaten share. Our hedge is focusing on customer centricity, innovating where product and offer differentiation directly meet unmet customer needs.

Digital Content Evolution: Rising consumer expectations and app fatigue increase pressure to deliver daily value beyond transactions. Scaling GenAI content generation and optimizing in-app experiences are critical hedges.

Reliance on Pay-for-Play Channels: Continued dependence on Meta/Google poses risk as LLM-driven search/visibility shifts accelerate. Mitigation requires diversification via SEO optimization, partnership ads, affiliate content, and testing new platforms (Pinterest, TikTok, WhatsApp, etc.).





   4. What objectives would MDs and other key stakeholders be most disappointed to have left out for 2026? 

Advanced Forecasting: While forward-looking forecasting of demand, CAC, and retention would improve resource allocation and give earlier visibility into marketing ROI, building these capabilities requires significant modeling and alignment effort across Finance, Data, and Marketing. Given our current focus on settled conversion measurement and efficiency automation, advanced forecasting will remain deprioritized in 2026, with only incremental improvements to existing planning and monitoring tools.

Portfolio-Level Optimization: Most of our steering still occurs at brand/channel level. A portfolio-aware approach to MMM and budget allocation (to capture cannibalization and halo effects across brands) could materially increase total HFG value, but may slip due to complexity.

Product Monetization Expansion: Alternative monetization models such as one-time ordering, non-subscription pathways, or flexible cadences have potential to attract new segments and reduce barriers to trial. We will test one-time ordering in a limited capacity in Q4 2025. Properly scaling and supporting these models requires product, operations, and go-to-market coordination beyond our current scope. In 2026, focus will remain on strengthening the subscription-led model, making it more engaging and re-engaging through improved brand experiences and app journeys.

Reactivations & Smaller Brands: The bulk of innovation focuses on large markets and leading brands. Smaller markets and brands risk being deprioritized for personalization, loyalty, and discount optimization, leaving value on the table.









Appendix

Appendix - Inspiration for 1 YP 





Focus Area (tied to objective 1): [Efficiency] Unlock efficiency by optimizing spend (CAC + D), step changing our organic growth volumes, and reinvesting savings into brand strength

Measure of success: Increase CCVA (conversions CVA) to $350MM, a 10% increase from 2025 baseline (to be reviewed with BP)

Objective Owner:  Marcus von Franck

Investment Type: Existing    |   HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  5. Efficiency Program/Cost to Serve 





Description: While we’ve made progress, the bulk of our marketing investments including discounts and media spend, remain manually managed. This leads to slow feedback loops, exposure to errors, and overspending on activations that never become lasting customers. By embedding AI-led optimization and channel management and shifting focus toward higher-quality, retained customers, we will drive a step-change in marketing efficiency. Our goal is to deliver 25% more settled conversions (total, not proportional) at similar spend levels. This will free up resources to reinvest in brand building and create a more sustainable growth engine. We’ll achieve this by doing the following differently:

1. Transform the Growth Engine: Creative, Funnel & Performance Optimization 

   * Stepchange creative execution by building rapid customer-centric feedback loops with creative teams and using Gen AI to quickly produce content that resonates with customers, proving our products’ value in their lives while moving beyond purely transactional messaging

   * Automate performance marketing by shifting spend decisions (how much, when, where) to AI-led systems, with >80% of Google and paid social spend globally steered towards incremental settled conversions

   * Improve the conversion funnel by tailoring end-to-end experiences to different audiences, boosting CVRs and enabling higher CAC targets with more qualified traffic

   * Embed settled conversions as the core optimization metric for CVA growth, with playbooks to prioritize high-quality customers over discount seekers (60%+ churn by box 3 today).

   * Expand organic growth via SEO and GEO to rank top for food inspiration (including in LLMs), driving organic traffic and lowering reliance on paid ads in blended CAC

   * Measure and optimize for the incremental value of each campaign, using experimentation to validate results and refine measurement models. Measurement will also evolve to invest based on marginal value of advertising, focusing on the incremental return of each additional dollar spent

   * Double down on cultural halo performance channels (Influencers, Whitelisting, TikTok, Meta) that efficiently engage new audiences and place us at the center of culture. Be first to test new up and coming channels

2. Shape a Smarter Discount & Offer Strategy

   * Personalize discounting by deploying targeted offers (50% of spend) that move away from one-size-fits-all, campaign-level approaches

   * Diversify third-party offers (e.g., Caraway) to deliver customer value while reducing discount reliance.

   * Develop rapid, low-cost testing methods (on-site, synthetic audiences) to trial offers, discount structures, and messaging without disrupting paid media efficiency





Focus Area (tied to objective 2) : [Consumer-Focused] Reignite cultural relevance of our brands, with a bold shift in brand marketing approach

Measure of success: Brand Buzz, TOMA/Awareness (TOMA for HF, Awareness for F_ and startup markets)

Objective Owner:  Patrick Stal

Investment Type: Existing    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  3. Brand Reignition 





Description: HFG’s marketing has leaned too heavily on lower funnel channels and discount mechanics, eroding brand equity and long-term value. Despite spending €2.5bn on media and discounts over the past year, our brands lack relevance, distinction and a differentiated brand image. Brand investments have been sporadic, shallow, and cut too quickly in pursuit of short-term results, limiting innovation in awareness-building channels. In 2026, we will reignite appetite for our brands by showing up in disruptive and unexpected ways and leveraging the equity of culinary expertise, hype-worthy food content and highly engaged foodie fan communities. We will stretch beyond ‘pay for play’ to build conversation, earn our role in media and culture and deepen community engagement. Finally, we will allocate the investment and measurement resources to create space for innovation and feedback loops on what sticks. We will do the following differently:

1. Move from transactional communication to emotionally resonant, insight driven storytelling and messaging 

   * Sharpen articulation of (global) value propositions, messaging houses and (global & regional) superiority claims

   * Drumbeat product marketing comms that meet key customer needs through customer experience upgrades, product novelty, and FOMO via exclusive chef partnerships (e.g., restaurant recipe collaborations)

   * Establish cross-channel media planning as a standard practice to tailor messages across the customer journey — from emotional benefits to highly persuasive conversion drivers

   * Anchor our global brands in clear creative platforms to enable bold execution and distinctive, ownable  yet diversified content and activations locally

   * Shift from discount reliance to persuasive superiority claims and value-add incentives (e.g. Ltd Edition Le Creuset cookware, subscriber-only events, health claims, community exclusive experiences)

2. Commit at least 20% of paid marketing investment in total Brand demand generation 

   * Invest strategically across Portfolio with deeper commitments in some markets - guided by brand maturity and competitive context, and flexing above 20% where appropriate

   * Ring-fence half of this investment into disruptive, experimental and non-traditional channels to create brand demand generation activities (examples in point 3 below)

3.  Radically diversify our ‘Brand’ channel mix beyond traditional high reach channels and content formats

   * Integrate our brands into entertainment properties and high reach video channels (e.g. Masterchef sponsorship & feature, ‘I’m a Celebrity’, owned culinary formats, sport, athlete and nutritionist sponsorships for Factor)

   * Bring to life sensory-rich experiential activations via local food festival and cultural events calendar (e.g. HF chefs at Taste Festivals, Factor sampling at sporting events, retail popups, airport arrival retail, etc.)

   * Bring reach and appeal for our target audience via celebrity ambassador programmes featuring aspirational sports, chefs, lifestyle, or cultural figures (at least 2 A+ listers per brand (HF/F) in NA  and 2 in INTL)

   * Leverage 3rd party partners for surprising brand integrations that build earned media (i.e. AirBNB product boxes, Ikea kitchen partnership, special edition Crocs, Spotify culinary playlists, at least 4 cookware partnerships in NA (e.g. Zwilling, Misen, Caraway, Nutribullet, NINJA and 2 partnerships for Factor (e.g. Oura, lululemon, Hoku, etc))

   * At least 4 major multi-year sponsorships across global markets that strengthen our brands’ distinct propositions and build high physical visibility with our target communities (eg. venues, teams, events, competitions, festivals etc.)

   * Engage super fan communities for storytelling and advocacy by helping them identify, connect, celebrate, and advocate as part of the brand community - online and offline

4. Establish a clear Brand Measurement Model 

   * Quantify the most efficient way to build our brand with our audiences through a clear model that tracks efficiency of dollars spent on a single, comparable input metric (CPM, cost per impression).

   * Optimise the marketing mix by leveraging Ad Tech to deliver a brand MMM that measures channel contribution to brand metrics and commercial outcomes, covering 75% of brand investment by end of 2026.

   * Strengthen Brand Equity by dynamically deploying investments toward proven drivers of equity and growth.





Focus Area (tied to objective 2) : [Infrastructure] Build Muscle for Telling Brand Story and Change Consumer Value Perception

Measure of success: Grow XX% in total raw consideration, as a measure of the total# of brand considerers we have gained

Objective Owner: Patrick Stal

Investment Type: Existing    |   HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  3. Brand Reignition





Description: Despite Customer Centricity being one of HFG’s DNA values, we are not truly a customer-centric business today. We have cost-engineered products at the customer’s expense, built digital experiences around our own capabilities rather than their desires, and drifted away from the places where they naturally congregate, online and offline. To reignite the role our brands play in culture and improve how audiences perceive us, we must start with them. We must embed the customer into every decision we take. In marketing, this means embedding customer insights into every step of how we plan, create, and deliver experiences. In 2026, we will do the following differently:

1. Institutionalize Customer-Centric Planning

   * Embed customer insights into planning and execution, replacing inside-out thinking with an outside-in perspective. The planning cycle will start with a ‘customer brief’ to ensure all functions are building from a common set of insights. We will end it with a ‘knowledge agenda’ identifying the knowledge gaps and research roadmap to address those gaps.

   * Strengthen Customer Insights’ partnership with IXI research team as a global knowledge base (e.g. Slack ‘knowledge bot’ adoption expansion, synthetic audience democratization, ‘open to all’ focus groups across markets)

   * Dedicated time in every SMT summit to bring the ‘customer’ into the conversation (led by GCI & IXI Research)

   * Establish a rapid 24-hour insight cycle to ensure reputational priorities guide creative, messaging, and portfolio choices 

2. Define & Drive Perception Shifts Across the Experience

   * Anchor each brand in 1–2 clear messaging pillars (e.g., sustainable choice, fun discovery, trusted health companion) and ensure our external tone of voice reflects how customers actually talk about food - eliminating jargon in favor of cultural relevance (e.g., training AI copy and QA tools to flag and remove jargon)

   * Map the current brand experience and escalate fixes cross-functionally identifying low points versus desired standards, with SMT commitment to prioritize resolution

   * Reinforce brand experience beyond campaigns embedding it into product design, packaging, customer service, and the unboxing experience - making non-functional aspects of the brand come alive at every touchpoint

3. Build a Modern Content Engine

   * Automate transactional asset production (currently 80% of what we produce) and reallocate talent to create bold, platform-native stories that spark conversation and connection 

   * Transform recipe experience from instructions into cultural currency, reimagined through short-form video, creator partnerships, guided cook-along tooling, and interactive formats making them the emotional anchor of our brand. 

   * Build a global world-class paid social content-feedback-content engine by building on Xpod, fueling an ambition to deploy >20% of our paid spend into social

   * Build conviction in brand narratives and social-first creativity, training teams and automating rapid test-and-scale loops so our stories evolve at the speed of culture

4. Meet our brand target communities where they are

   * Actively listen to and take part in brand conversation ensuring we are listening and observing hyper local food trends, key categories of interest and cultural nuance per market to feel the pulse of conversation happening around our brands

   * Authentically contribute to our target audience’s online/offline communities and the passion points with which we want our brands to be associated (culinary and health) to meet them where they already are (TikTok, Instagram, Reddit, streaming platforms, audio apps, AI assistants, and dating platforms and IRL) and taking part in the conversations they care about

   * Master Paid Social to become the channel to test fast and scale the best performing content, native formats and messaging that most effectively engages our target customers  

   * Build nimble, experimental creative muscles tailored to the speed of social, while embedding cultural cues into the entire HelloFresh journey from sign-up to retention so food is experienced not just as utility, but as inspiration, creativity, and connection





Focus Area (tied to objective 4) : [Consumer-Focused] Build Lasting Customer Relationships Beyond the Box

Measure of success: Increase TCVA contribution of CRM channels by 20% (to be reviewed with BP) YoY while keeping opt-out rates stable or lower YoY

Objective Owner:  Jal TummalaJashil KimMarie Seeger

Investment Type: Existing    |   HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  4. App Experience





Description: In line with our goal of transforming the HelloFresh app into a daily food companion, our growth depends on building lasting relationships with our entire user base, from prospects to our most loyal customers. Historically, our user base marketing has been entirely transactional. We rely on discount-heavy pushes to convert leads and re-engage lapsed users, while limiting communication with active subscribers to managing their next box. In 2026, we will shift to a content-led strategy that reinforces the value we provide customers across their end-to-end food journey, not just when they order from one of our brands. This will transform our user experience into a new driver of our sustainable growth engine. 

   * Transform CRM communication channels into a source of daily value for customers, showcasing content and tools that help them with their daily food needs

   * Excite lapsed customers with content by giving them a reason to stay engaged through value-focussed, personalized content coming from both local and global sources

   * Improve the effectiveness of referral communications, powered by AI and ML, to encourage our most engaged customers to share content and refer friends - building on existing and finding new growth loops 

   * Expand the breadth of channels we use to communicate with leads, customers and formers adapting our experience to new messaging platforms (E.g. SMS, RCS, Whatsapp, etc.)





Focus Area : [Infrastructure] Modernize our marketing operating model and talent  





Measure of success: Over 75% of Marketing team members are at the medium level of the AI 

Objective Owner: Patrick Stal

Investment Type: Existing    |   HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  5. Efficiency Program/Cost to Serve

Description: Generative AI is redefining how campaigns are created, optimized, and scaled. This is an opportunity to build leaner, faster, and more provocative machines than the one we operate. Our ambition is that in 2026, HelloFresh should start to  operate as an advanced and provocative marketing organization: a GenAI-first machine powered by bold, world-class talent. Our teams will spend less time managing tasks and more time shaping culture, driving creativity, and building lasting brand relevance. We will achieve this by doing the following differently :

1. Automate the Marketing Backbone (also covered in DO 4) : 

   * Hardwire automation across campaign management, reporting, and diagnostics to collapse cycle times from wks to hrs. 

   * Automate intelligence to reallocate spend in real time across channels, audiences, and creative, while 

   * Personalize engines  that dynamically adapt offers and journeys at scale

   * Stronger foundational forecasting models and automate >50% of the current marketing budget process - freeing up hundreds of hours of capacity for more value-add tasks

2. Redesign the Marketing Operating Model

   * Shift from manual execution to automation-led orchestration, with a central control tower overseeing guardrails and agile pods combining media, data, and creative in continuous test-and-learn cycles

   * Daily and Weekly tracking meetings will be fed by AI and ML engines, and will be decision meetings rather than reporting mechanisms (recommendations being automated)

   * Playbook documentation will be standardized, archived in a crawlable manner for our AI enabled Marketing skill base

   * Best practices will be shared more pro-actively, and our tools will help us identify where learnings from one market could lift another in the portfolio

   * Shift human focus from repetitive tasks to brand building, provocative storytelling, and cultural engagement

3. Industrialize Creative Production (also covered in DOs 1 and 2)

   * Transform creative into a high-velocity system, where automation and AI accelerate asset generation, adaptation, and testing across formats.

   * Support storyboarding, copy design, and creative variation through GenAI, while strict guardrails ensure efficiency enhances, rather than dilutes, brand integrity and cultural resonance

4. Rewire Talent & Capabilities

   * Provide learning opportunity to receive basic AI training all marketing talent 

   * Map Talent on AI proficiency model per function, and AI proficiency will be a core aspect of JDs, competency maps, performance reviews and career progression

   * Reshape team to thrive in an automation-first world by adding new muscles : automation specialists, creative technologists and data engineers while ensuring existing talent becomes fluent in AI-enabled tools
