Mealkits Domain 2026





Section 1: Context 





1. The 2028 Vision Statement

By 2028, HelloFresh will be the undisputed global leader in personalized home cooking, efficiently delivering high quality ingredients and transforming daily meals into joyful, effortlessly diverse, and waste-free culinary experiences for millions worldwide.





2. Where We Are Today (Q3 2025 Snapshot)

Following our initial growth stage, a period of pandemic-fueled demand and capacity constraints, and a phase post-pandemic focused on regaining efficiency, we are now at the beginning of our fourth stage as a global meal kit business in which we will reassert our premium quality positioning, transform the level of selection and personalization within our customer offering, and re-ignite cultural relevance and engagement across our brands. We must pursue this fourth stage with urgency as 2025 HFG meal kit net revenue is projected to land 29% off of the peak achieved in 2022 and we have not yet bottomed out. However, while there is much to address, we are well positioned to achieve our vision given the many strengths we possess and opportunities in front of us.

We continue to be the clear market leader with established brand recognition and deep expertise in delivering a reliably delicious cooking experience for customers. With both direct-to-consumer and direct-to-grower relationships as well as a bespoke ingredient assortment (e.g. small pack sizes, optimized for transit), we operate a streamlined supply chain capable of achieving significantly less food waste and shorter time from harvest to plate than traditional grocery and restaurant supply chains. Over the years, we have accumulated process power to support high quality delivery as well as profitability, despite the expansive challenges of grocery e-commerce. In addition, our direct feedback loop with customers has also allowed us to continuously improve our offering and access to customer data is an asset we can continue building on. Given our ability to deliver a true “value-add” product, customers have shown a higher willingness to pay for our offering which further allows us to operate with higher margins than grocery.

Despite these strengths, we are faced with many challenges. The meal kit category is contracting and brand consideration significantly lags awareness. Customer acquisition costs have increased over recent years making it increasingly difficult to overcome customer churn with new conversions. Further, despite reductions in discount spend over recent years, we still rely heavily on discount offers to drive conversion and our brands are strongly associated with discount messaging. Rigidity in our subscription offering worsens this challenge as subscription serves as a barrier to conversion and we lack multiple entry points for customers to engage with our brands.

From a customer offering perspective, cost pressures and our fulfillment model have constrained our assortment leading us to limited personalization and customizability even compared to direct competitors. Our pricing is often perceived as premium, which is difficult when we are not sufficiently elevating quality perception and in periods of consumer belt-tightening. On top of these issues, topics such as ordering inflexibility (e.g. 5 day cut-off) and packaging waste continue to impose, not relieve, mental burden on customers.

Looking forward, our opportunity is as big as ever. Dinner is still an unsolved problem for most households, and the need for convenient, healthy, and reliable solutions persists. We are well positioned to meet that demand, especially if we can level up quality perception, accelerate innovation and personalization, and increase our relevance to and presence in cultural discussions around food and home cooking. We have a right to win as an authority on home cooking and as a daily food companion for our customers given our direct relationship with customers and proven ability to support them in achieving delicious home-cooked meals. Expanding engagement with our brands beyond weekly transactions (which is the best-case-scenario today), will facilitate more lasting customer relationships and allow us to monetize those more over time. Leveraging AI will increase our potential by enabling more personalized customer experiences, accelerating time to market, improving targeting of high-value customer segments, and further optimizing our supply chain. 

While the opportunity ahead remains huge, the threats present are significant. Competition in the food space remains intense, spanning direct meal kit rivals, grocers offering ready-to-cook options, and broader delivery platforms. Macroeconomic conditions add pressure: inflation and supply chain volatility can squeeze margins, while economic uncertainty makes customers more cautious about paying for what is perceived as a premium service. Rapidly evolving consumer preferences, subscription fatigue, and the risk of increased regulation of subscription models further complicate the picture. Finally, the same generative AI tools that create opportunity for us also arm consumers with powerful alternatives, from AI-driven meal planning to Instacart-enabled shopping lists. 

Overall, we have many strengths to lean on, but we need to pursue our top objectives with urgency to reignite customer engagement and growth.

3. The "Why": Supporting Market & Customer Insights

Across markets, with HelloFresh we are targeting customers who feel the tension described by: “I seek to home cook more often, but busy weeknights and limited headspace make interesting and more enjoyable dinners feel out of reach.” They value home cooking and the associated benefits, but struggle to make it work in a satisfying, non-repetitive way. They tend towards being female and having above average incomes, though among our actual customer base we do see a range of income levels. Alongside HelloFresh, with Green Chef we are targeting customers pursuing a wholesome, clean lifestyle, with specific health targets elevated among their priorities, while with EveryPlate and Chef’s Plate we are targeting more price-sensitive customers who are less driven by culinary inspiration, but are still looking for efficient home-cooked meals that are delicious, somewhat varied, and not over complex.





Diving deeper into what is preventing people from converting to HelloFresh, 2024 US research found concerns over subscription commitment and whether there would be enough value for the price were the top two barriers. On the latter point, when we recently surveyed over two thousand US consumers and asked “What aspects are important to you when you think about meal kit subscription services?” both HelloFresh customers and general population respondents rated “high quality ingredients” as most important above topics such as “has good variety,” “is healthy,” and “is affordable.” Respondents then rated HelloFresh, specifically, across the same set of dimensions and results showed the gap between importance rating and perceived HelloFresh performance was widest across “is affordable,” “has substantial portion sizes,” “has good variety week to week,” and “uses high quality ingredients.” Separate from this research, across markets the top issue cited in cancellation topics (30% INTL, 40% NA) is cost with customers mentioning poor value versus grocery. The second most prevalent issue (20% INTL, 17% NA) is account management with complaints focused on difficulty cancelling, duplicate subscriptions, and general lack of subscription clarity and flexibility. 





Putting this all together, value for money perception, especially relative to grocery, and the nature of our subscription offering are critical to address. Although we could approach the former from multiple angles, we should first prioritize high quality ingredients as a non-negotiable for customers. 





Looking at direct competitors across markets, we see two main trends. In International markets, several top competitors have invested significantly more in COGS and with less emphasis on marketing spend, which has led to slower acquisition, but much stronger retention. For instance, My Food Bag in New Zealand, which claims the highest market penetration globally, emphasizes local, artisanal ingredients and only spends 5% of revenue on marketing. Cheffelo in the Nordics, as well, is growing relative to us while investing more into the product with focus on local ingredients and variety, despite 8-10% higher prices for customers. Meanwhile, in the US, competition is rushing towards convenience offerings opening space for us to truly own home cooking. Hungryroot is the most threatening direct competitor, recently matching our share of new customer acquisition. Their strategy emphasizes a broader grocery offering, more basic, convenient recipes, and personalization with significant customer data collection beginning with a lengthy sign-up quiz and extending through the customer journey. 





Beyond our direct competitors, several themes are prevalent in the market. Recognition of food as a driver of health and wellness takes many forms. Across the board, protein dominates claims with consumers searching out protein-rich foods. In the US, MAHA is a driving force against “ultra-processed” foods and additives. More broadly, there is focus on “clean” ingredient lists with consumers caring about what goes into their food and a desire for hyper-personalization with food tailored to individual needs. At the same time, GLP-1 usage is increasingly mainstream shaping appetites and dietary preferences of a broader set of consumers. 





Convenience remains a key trend in the market, but consumer demands extend beyond mere speed to also encompass health, diverse tastes, and a demand for value.  82% of US HelloFresh customers believe it is important for a meal kit to save them time and effort prepping ingredients and cooking, however only 75% agree that HelloFresh meets those expectations. Overall, consumers are increasingly seeking quick, easy, and healthy meal solutions through a rise in 5-minute meals, grocery RTE, and social media "hacks." Ambient foods, including heat-and-eat and "just add water" formats, are also gaining popularity due to their frugality, convenience, and sustainability.  





Current flavor trends indicate a desire for both nostalgic comfort and adventurous novelty, as consumers seek emotional connection through familiar tastes while also craving new sensory experiences. Emerging trends like "Swavoury" (sweet and savory) are expanding beyond traditional pairings to include innovative combinations such as cinnamon honey fried chicken. Tropical ingredients like mango, lychee, and passion fruit are increasingly featured in a wide array of new products, from burgers to cereals, and notably ranked highly among HelloFresh US customers as an appealing food trend. Further, flavor themes delivered through cuisine trends are crucial drivers in consumer meal selection, ranking third after protein type and new/novelty. A recent survey revealed that HelloFresh customers, more so than the general population, look to HelloFresh to help them discover new recipes, flavors, and cuisines, underscoring the importance of leveraging flavor, ingredient, and cuisine trends to fuel product innovation.





These brief highlights by no means comprehensively direct where we need to take our meal kits business in every market; however, they provide common grounding for who we are serving and what are some key themes we need to consider.

Section 2: Domain Objectives





Our primary areas of investment proposed for 2026 are described below by priority. 





1. Objective: Achieve market-leading ingredient value perception through improved quality, packaging, and SKU innovation

Measure of success: Improve ingredient quality net sentiment by 10ppts yoy (as captured in the iNPS and rNPS surveys)

Objective Owner:  Adam Kalikow

Investment Type: Existing    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  1. Quality, Variety & Concepts 

Description: Ingredients are the foundation of how customers experience both the quality and the value of our product. Today, being “good enough” is not sufficient; our ambition is to delight customers with an elevated ingredient value perception that strengthens trust, drives loyalty, and differentiates us in the market. To achieve this, we will focus on three priorities. First, we will aggressively reform and/or retire underperforming ingredients to raise the overall quality bar. Second, we will onboard new ingredients with hero-quality potential that can become distinctive highlights of our menu. Third, we will prioritize packaging improvements to ensure both the performance and the perception of ingredient quality, reinforcing freshness and care at every touchpoint. We anticipate we will need to impact 100-200 ingredient SKUs for each market with a to-be-determined mix of reforming existing ingredients and onboarding net new ingredients. Specific prioritization will vary by market and be set in more detailed planning. Delivering on this ambition will require structural investments in ingredients to ensure the quality and         differentiation our customers expect.





2. Objective: Deliver an XXL menu to customers in every mature market before the end of 2026 (i.e. make XXL possible)

Measure of success: Reach a minimum of 200 core recipes available weekly across mature markets

Objective Owner:  Ian Brooks

Investment Type: New    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  2. Menu Expansion 4. App Experience

Description: To better serve our customers, we need to expand the breadth and depth of choice we offer each week. Our current menu size limits variety and rapid innovation, and constrains our ability to cater to specific customer needs over time. By expanding the menu to over 500 recipes (min. 200) plus layering modular customization on top, we will move beyond serving the “average” customer and instead provide richer, more relevant choices to every customer. Achieving this requires more flexible and scalable fulfillment and product operations, supported by improved tooling and automation across the entire menu creation value chain: recipe development, editing, planning, forecasting, display and selection, fulfillment, and cooking. Key enablers include advancing and further integrating personalization and forecasting models, delivering a world-class curated menu and selection experience with better navigation and search, and enhancing the digital cooking journey within our app.





3. Objective: Level-shift variety, menu relevance, and concept innovation within the XXL menu (i.e. make XXL great)

Measure of success: Increase orders after menu interaction by 10%

Objective Owner:  Nina Wagner

Investment Type: Existing    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  1. Quality, Variety & Concepts 3. Brand Re-ignition

Description: To attract new customers and continually excite existing ones, we must go beyond simply expanding the number of recipes and deliver a richer sense of variety through a significantly differentiated menu that shifts customer perception, strengthens relevance, accelerates concept innovation (e.g. fast assembly, batch, kids in the kitchen,...), and drives product-led growth week over week. Achieving this requires action across three areas. On the ingredient side, we must accelerate onboarding to expand the SKU catalogue and avoid repetition. Within the menu, we need to deepen choice across priority concepts (health/diets), amplify seasonality through produce-driven offerings, and strengthen cultural relevance by accelerating our time from “trend to table,” pursuing on-brand recipe partnerships, and piloting external creator contributions. Finally, to maximize impact, we will run distinct product-led campaigns each quarter, ensuring visibility and engagement across active and former customers as well as prospects. To support this objective, we intend to ramp new recipes to 40+ per week with a target run rate to add 1000+ proven recipes to each market’s recipe pool (assuming a 50+% new recipe hit rate).





4. Objective: Deliver a world-class personalized experience across the customer journey to improve order rates

Measure of success: Increase Orders Confirmed from [x] to [y], an increase of [TBC]% 

Objective Owner: Annie Meininghaus

Investment Type: Existing    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  2. Menu Expansion 4. App Experience

Description: We will further leverage our direct relationship with customers to advance our understanding of their wants and needs and personalize their experience with us. And this will be even more critical in order to maintain curation as we vastly expand the assortment. Pursuing this objective will involve three main components. First, we will establish unified customer profiles that can incorporate data across existing touchpoints (e.g. sign-up, digital shopping tracking, purchase behavior, survey submission, customer care interactions,...) and are accessible for use across domains. Second, we will strengthen the inflow of data from customers by introducing new feedback mechanisms (e.g. ingredient-level ratings) and providing customers more transparent reasons for why they should submit data (e.g. published reviews and recipe ratings, continuously improving recommendations,...). Finally, while we will seek to apply the enriched customer profiles across all parts of the customer experience (e.g. CRM campaigns, discount offers, add-on upselling,...), we will prioritize significantly moving the needle on the quality of digital menu merchandising, including recipe and modularity pre-selections, menu ordering, and a “for you” curated menu collection. 





5. Objective: Reignite cultural relevance of our brands, with a bold shift in our brand marketing approach and an emphasis on home cooking 

Measure of success: +25% top of mind awareness

Objective Owner:  Patrick Stal

Investment Type: Existing    |  HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  3. Brand Re-ignition 

Description: Aided brand awareness is generally above 75% across HelloFresh markets, yet top-of-mind awareness and brand consideration regularly fall 30 to 50 points lower. Brand investments have been sporadic, shallow, and cut too quickly in pursuit of short-term results, limiting innovation in awareness-building channels. We need to take HelloFresh from being perceived as a meal kit company with a relatively narrow offering, aggressive marketing, and heavy discounts to being looked to as an inspirational champion of and most-trusted partner for home cooking. In 2026, we will reignite appetite for our brands by showing up in disruptive and unexpected ways and leveraging the equity of culinary expertise, hype-worthy food content and highly engaged foodie fan communities. We will stretch beyond ‘pay for play’ to build conversation, earn our role in media and culture and deepen community engagement. Finally, we will allocate the investment and measurement resources to create space for innovation and feedback loops on what sticks, using “soft” metrics (e.g., TOMA, Consideration etc.) as our signposts rather than traditional CAC / ROI targets. 

FAQs





1. Where are the opportunities for GenAI applications in your domain?

While potential applications are endless, we will focus on three opportunities particularly relevant to our objectives:

1. Product Development: With Project Concorde, GenAI is already showing the promise to drastically reduce the time and resources required for recipe content creation (e.g. recipe card generation with “3” clicks instead of 10 weeks, 3 tools, and 3 teams). This will allow us to massively scale selection for customers without linearly scaling the required manual workload. It will also enable us to accelerate the time from recipe ideation to customers’ tables and adapt quickly to dynamics such as required ingredient substitutions for a smoother customer experience. Beyond content creation, GenAI will support consumer research and product analytics, as well as enhance culinary ideation and concept validation.

2. Personalization: GenAI will play a role in optimizing areas such as personalized product recommendations, reactivation content, or incentives/offers. However, it can play an equally pivotal role further upstream from model development and inference by enabling better data collection to feed into customer profiles. For instance, rather than rely only on static customer data from sources such as the sign-up quiz and meal selection, a conversational AI agent can help us build a rich understanding of customer wants and needs that can persist into personalization of our offering over time.

3. Marketing Content: GenAI will be key in accelerating the cycle of content generation, testing, and iteration so that we can optimize how we breakthrough to ignite brand relevance in a crowded marketplace. GenAI will not just support ad content, but also content which will help us expand our engagement with customers beyond simply transacting.





2. What are you doing to improve the customer experience?

We are giving customers more relevant choice and personalized offerings, bringing fresh and exciting concepts every week, and elevating perceived ingredient quality and packaging.





3. What are the known risks or obstacles to achieving these objectives?

XXL menu expansion across markets will require significant investments into infrastructure, operational process alignment and change, and rapid learning from pilot markets/sites. Timelines will be tight to learn, invest, and manage change across markets to achieve XXL menus in all markets within 2026. Further, we will need plans to address diverse sites (e.g. conventional vs. automated) across our network. Assuming we unlock XXL menus, we will need to both avoid negative quality impacts and invest in our menu offering so we do not turn off customers with more of the same. Finally, we need to drive our teams away from risk aversion and towards agile approaches to swarming, launching, learning, and iterating.





There is a risk that we will need to prioritize limited sourcing capacity across onboarding new ingredients to serve variety, onboarding new ingredients to serve “hero” quality perception, reforming existing ingredients, and reworking primary ingredient packaging. These may overlap significantly, but if we have to prioritize, certain objectives may become at risk.





The ROI of marketing activities meant to drive TOMA and consideration will be harder to measure than BTL marketing, for instance. We will need conviction to maintain investment so impact can build over time.





4. What objectives would MDs and other key stakeholders be most disappointed to have left out for 2026? 

The following objective related to flexibility for customers was ranked highest outside of the top 5. We chose to prioritize our current objective #5 over this one since we believe it is even more critical to deliver in 2026.

“Build lasting relationships through increased flexibility”: We aim to break the costly cycle of customer activation-cancellation-reactivation, increase our active monetizable customer base, and make it easier for customers to stay engaged. We will do this by introducing more ways for customers to shop with us and engage outside of auto-recurring orders. For instance, we will enable ordering without subscription, unlock one-off boxes from other brands (e.g. Good Chop BBQ box sold to a HelloFresh customer as a standalone order), expand pause and ordering cadence flexibility (e.g. explore infinite pause, non-weekly intervals), allow for ordering across brands with a unified account, and test alternate flexible pricing models and mechanisms (e.g., recipe based pricing, micro surcharging/downcharging).





We have also dropped the creation of an "unboxing experience of the future” as a potential objective. We want to make progress towards a significantly improved unboxing experience in 2026 (e.g. better quality control, more organization, more premium feel,..), but believe objectives 1 to 5 have higher priority.
