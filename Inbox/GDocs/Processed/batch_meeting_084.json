This section does not impact the maximum number of pages]\n\nReview Meeting Date: Oct 16, 2025\n\nAttendees: Ed Boyes Assaf Ronen Dominik Richter Holger Hammel,Cho HwangAnnie MeininghausDina MehrezThomas GrieselFabien SimonMarlene RosnerBrian LeungAdriana VillarEvan WeintraubJama Musse\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways, Decisions, and Next Steps:\n\n1. Clarify how menu expansion plans, personalization roll outs  and app features come together: \n\n   * Elysium (new store and homepage in the app) roll out is fast followed by new app feature which benefits users  irrespective of menu ranking roll out (most notably merchandising widgets for marketing,  recommendation widgets,bringing search to apps, populating “most popular, “trending” widgets - details)\n\n   * Menu ranking roll out: At the same time there is a roll out plan for menu ranking models which prioritizes P500 readiness in Q4/Q1 as well as Penguin for Factor US. Food Systems is trying to expedite Penguin for INTL if possible, prioritized after p500. Fall back is to launch Penguin Harp personalization to INTL markets expanding in Q1.  Other RTE markets in H2.\n\n2. Share prioritization framework  for Project 5M. The prioritization is heavily influenced by successful companies and features observed (direct or indirect competitors) as well as through an internal workshop. This revealed a consistent and significant behavioral gap: Users enthusiastically save recipes (often from social media) but rarely act on them. This indicates a high desire for inspiration but a significant friction point in execution. This led to the prioritization of the recipe bridge in Q4/Q1. If requested we can  walk through the detailed methodology.\n\n3. Decouple forecasting from personalization models. Food Systems to define technical interfaces enabling independent iteration. Once validated, assess org impact in Q1–Q2.\n\n4. Reconcile marketing RAF plan with tech YP.  We have addressed the  gap between Marketing and Consumer growth targets. Share squad will focus on strengthening the Refer-a-Friend (RAF) program while building new in-product sharing loops to drive organic growth. prioritizing foundational fixes — improving data visibility, customer experience, and operational agility — to make the RAF program self-sufficient and easier to optimize without tech dependencies. \n\n5. Variable pricing is an urgently requested feature by markets. We added it  to the Market Innovation squad backlog H2. Will define long-term ownership before initiation as we are currently moving pricing ownership to growth MA. \n\n\n\n\n\nChanges requested to the Yearly Plan during Draft Reviews. Please update before submission for final YP approval:  \n\n* Should we invest into an AOV-focused squad? Yes we will self fund a new AOV driven squad in Q2 with a dedicated KPI. Focus in Q1  is first to roll out the new personalized core journey including widgets and then layer in more upselling components. \n\n* Loyalty strategy across markets: We decided to reserve a small team to  maintain and improve the existing  program while implementing  the new vendor based loyalty program to launch first in  the US . See Loyalty Strategy SMT Shareout.\n\n* Double check if all Factor requirements are in the plan: All documents were collected and integrated into the Market Innovation backlog. To be signed off by Ed Boyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\tI. Organizational Overview\n\nMission and Focus areas\n\nThe Consumer Mega Alliance vision is to create the best digital product exper\n\n\n\n-Q2. Focus is first to roll out the personalized core journey. Consider establishing a dedicated squad to drive AOV growth by separating merchandising ownership from shopping guidance, incorporating programs.\n\n\tAnnie Meininghaus\n\n\tPersonalization Model Rollout (Penguin & Harp)\n\n\tPrioritize P500 readiness in Q4/Q1 as well as Penguin for Factor US. Expand personalization to INTL markets (100–150 meals)  HF-UK, HF-CA, CP-CA (TBD), HF-ANZ, HF-BNL, HF-DKSE, HF-DEAT will follow Q1 / Q2. Other RTE markets in H2. Details in Ops Alliance YP.\n\n\tAnnie Meininghaus\n\n\tDecouple Forecasting from Personalization Models\n\n\tFood Systems to define technical interfaces enabling independent iteration. Once validated, assess org impact in Q1–Q2. See Forecasting Domain Boundaries.\n\n\tHolger Hammel\n\n\tFactor Tech Requests Review\n\n\tJama and Annie aligned with Adam Park to merge the Factor backlog with the Market Innovation squad list. Requests are now integrated and can be selected during quarterly planning.\n\n\tJama Musse\n\n\tVariable Pricing\n\n\tAdded to the Market Innovation squad backlog. Deferred until Q3. Will define long-term ownership before initiation.\n\n\tJama Musse\n\n\tFactor Programs Transition Plan\n\n\tPause Programs on Factor funnel for peak since results are negative. Alison Ryanwill partner with Commercial and New Programs hire in NA to design a better “Active Experience” and 3rd-party partnerships. Aligned timeline is Q2.\n\n\tJama Musse\n\n\tProject 5M Prioritization (App Engagement)\n\n\tLisa Trueblood preparing a one-pager summarizing prioritization framework and decisions for follow-up discussion.\n\n\tEvan Weintraub\n\n\tLoyalty Strategy Across Markets\n\n\tDecided to reserve 20% of engineering IC capacity to maintain and improve the legacy program while evolving the new loyalty framework. See Loyalty Strategy SMT Shareout.\n\n\tEvan Weintraub\n\n\tReferral (RAF) Program Alignment\n\n\tAddress gap between Marketing and Consumer growth targets.

Sree Lakshmi Rangavazzula shared their methods for communicating technical roadblocks, balancing scalability with immediate needs, addressing urgent feature requests, and coaching team members for career growth by providing ownership and exposure to stakeholder meetings. They also inquired about the HelloFresh engineering ladder, to which Nikita Gorshkov explained the reporting structure for Staff engineers and confirmed that technical improvements are prioritized with an impact statement through the normal sprint process, with up to 30% of sprint time allocated for KTLO.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\n* Introduction and Interview Structure Nikita Gorshkov welcomed Sree Lakshmi Rangavazzula to the stakeholder interview and explained that while Sree Lakshmi Rangavazzula is interviewing for a parallel team, they will likely work together frequently due to existing predispositions between the teams (00:00:00). Nikita Gorshkov outlined the interview format, which includes introductions, context about their team, a discussion of a project Sree Lakshmi Rangavazzula is proud of, and time for Sree Lakshmi Rangavazzula's questions, with a planned duration of 45 minutes (00:01:13). Nikita Gorshkov leads the new ventures product team at HelloFresh, which focuses on launching and integrating M\\&A opportunities and new brands, such as Factor and Goodshop (00:02:08).\n\n* Sree Lakshmi Rangavazzula's Background and Experience Sree Lakshmi Rangavazzula introduced themself, noting they have over 13 years of industry experience, mainly in front-end web applications across e-commerce, medical, travel, and finance domains (00:03:19). Since joining their current global company in 2023, they have worked on unified features and applications for multiple lines of business (LOBs) and banners, which involved the challenging task of finding common, performance-effective solutions. Sree Lakshmi Rangavazzula emphasizes close collaboration with the product team when patterns of regression issues emerge, to align on business perspective and technical solutions (00:04:22).\n\n* Stakeholder Management and Feature Development Sree Lakshmi Rangavazzula described their approach to working with stakeholders, starting with initial consultations to understand the feature's goal for scalability and reusability, referencing a homepage redesign intended to improve UX and track user activity as an example (00:05:52). They noted that stakeholders are heavily involved in the initial stages and again during functional testing for sign-off before production, with the development team taking the lead during implementation, only reaching out to stakeholders for discrepancy confirmation (00:07:18).\n\n* Handling Timeline Challenges and Scope Negotiation Sree Lakshmi Rangavazzula provided an example where a requirement for a server-driven user interface initially estimated at five months had to be delivered within three months by leadership (00:08:37). To address this, they engaged in back-and-forth negotiati\n\n\n\nhere is it because we can build something faster in the future or is it will it have a customer impact?\n\n \n\n \n\n00:40:03\n\n \n\nNikita Gorshkov: Both of those things together with the product manager you can create and craft a impact statement of like hey guys like if we do this this will be bring us X Y and Z why don't we invest some time right now into it. So and then it just goes into normal priorization for the\n\nSree Lakshmi Rangavazzula: Yeah.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: sprint.\n\nSree Lakshmi Rangavazzula: And also when we talk numbers and metrics with a proper presentation, it kind of um explains things better uh to the stakeholders. So uh do you follow the same uh similar\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Yep. Uh we we follow the impact uh confidence and uh efforts estimate\n\nSree Lakshmi Rangavazzula: approach?\n\nNikita Gorshkov: uh like basically framework. Uh the estimates we do on depends on what sizing but is it either FT per year or FT per weeks. Um, and that's how we size different things. Uh, confidence,\n\nSree Lakshmi Rangavazzula: Awesome.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: we have a confidence scoring system, but it, this one is a bit wishy-washy. It's a confidence in how confident are we that the business impact that we've calculated, we're actually going to be able to deliver. Um, and of course impact, we have business cases everywhere. Um, it's fairly straightforward or should be\n\nSree Lakshmi Rangavazzula: Uh, that's pretty much from my end as well. So,\n\nNikita Gorshkov: cool.\n\nSree Lakshmi Rangavazzula: it was great to meet you and thanks a lot for the\n\nNikita Gorshkov: No. Uh, look, this was uh a a pleasure from my ends.\n\nSree Lakshmi Rangavazzula: opportunity.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Um, it was very structured. I really appreciate the in-depth answers that you actually prepared really well as well. I thought they were on point.

Nikita Gorshkov introduced their concept of context-driven product management, detailing a custom automated system that curates a knowledge base of entities and relationships to improve generative AI output, but raised concerns about scaling this approach due to the lack of consolidated infrastructure and the \"nightmare\" of locating the correct version of institutional knowledge across disparate tools. The participants compared AI models, with Nikita Gorshkov preferring Gemini over Claude for general text and deep research, and they agreed that high-value AI capabilities for product managers lie in data discovery and analysis—specifically, using CLI tools to quickly analyze data and identify optimization opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\nNotes Length: Standard\n\n* Golden Path for AI-Native PDLC and Product Management Bottlenecks Mario Konschake is working with PEP to define and roll out the golden path for an AI-native Product Development Lifecycle (PDLC) (00:00:00). Mario Konschake explained that while there is a good candidate for software engineers (cloud code spec machine) and initial ideas for UX designers, product management is likely to become the bottleneck if engineering and UX speed up. The challenge lies in effectively supporting product managers in providing better and faster context to feed the development pipeline (00:01:56).\n\n* Context-Driven Product Management and Knowledge Curation Nikita Gorshkov introduced their concept of context-driven product management, which has evolved since its initial version (00:03:19). They believe that product management is highly interconnected, requiring a lift-and-shift transition in working methods rather than peacemeal automation to gain the full benefits of AI. Nikita Gorshkov has developed a custom system using cloud code across two machines to maintain their own knowledge base of entities and relationships, which continuously learns and adds context to improve the output quality of generative AI tools (00:04:48).\n\n* Challenges with Scaling Context Management and Infrastructure Mario Konschake noted that Nikita Gorshkov's approach of curating a context knowledge base seems to be a common pattern among AI-engaged product managers (00:06:06). Nikita Gorshkov raised concerns about scaling this, emphasizing the need to define future infrastructure and tools, ideally for one to two years, to avoid multiplying inefficiencies. A critical challenge is the lack of a consolidated source of truth, as people are using various tools, making learning non-transferable and knowledge management a persistent problem (00:07:29).\n\n* Need for Centralized Documentation and Access Nikita Gorshkov highlighted the difficulty in identifying the correct version of documentation across systems like Google Docs, Confluence, and Jira, calling it a \"nightmare\" that is exacerbated by AI (00:09:07). They noted that institutional knowledge often resides in disparate places—Slack, random Google Docs, and code—and there is no clear indicator of the most current or accurate information (00:11:42). Mario Konschake agreed that the challenge lies in making knowledge accessi\n\n\n\nto a little bit\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Sounds good.

Um, I'll probably be updating it to like to that next step of okay, how do you then you do all of the processes that uh you want to automate but through like clock codes for example and then share it at least with my PMs and whoever wants to read it. Um,\n\nMario Konschake: Yeah,\n\nNikita Gorshkov: and there's a notebook to ask\n\nMario Konschake: it would also be good feedback for me to understand like how uh how that will work\n\nNikita Gorshkov: questions.\n\nMario Konschake: with your PMS kind of CLI, right? is that is something that they are struggling with or they like first of all are they like curious eager to try it out uh and then is that something that is difficult for them or is that actually something that they can learn if they want to so that's I think it's a very important data point for me at this point as\n\nNikita Gorshkov: I don't think it's that complic.\n\nMario Konschake: well\n\nNikita Gorshkov: It's just you need to get used to it.

Addressing Nikita Gorshkov's query about shortening time to market and running parallel experiments, Gabriel Gregório suggested incorporating faster research methods like social media surveys or third-party small-group testing alongside traditional A/B testing, citing an example of using two-way messaging for payment reminders at a bank. Gabriel Gregório also offered region-specific qualitative methods for Brazil, like in-app surveys with discounts, and quantitative methods, such as engaging campaigns or competitions to gather measurable data on potential new users and order frequency, while Nikita Gorshkov clarified that their company is globally hiring for an analytics role and has not yet expanded to Brazil due to requirements around \"meat culture,\" pricing, and infrastructure, though the market is considered interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\nNotes Length: Standard\n\n* Data Visualization and Insights in the Wellness Sector Gabriel Gregório discussed their prior work in data visualization for a wellness company, noting that their job became more focused on analyzing and providing insights rather than just sending pre-order information. A significant data point provided was related to user activity around gyms, which included details about subscribers within a certain radius, other types of gyms nearby, and the number of new users resulting from subscription changes, which the company lacked before. This data, visualized in a quick-reference dashboard, enabled the sales team to negotiate with clients more effectively and demonstrate the product's value by offering precise user activity metrics down to the neighborhood level, leading to a new approach for sellers (00:01:49).\n\n* Strategies for Shortening Time to Market Nikita Gorshkov asked Gabriel Gregório about methods to shorten the time to market and enable multiple experiments in parallel, especially when standard A/B testing takes significant time (00:04:44). Gabriel Gregório suggested using alternative, faster research methods alongside A/B testing, such as social media surveys or engaging a third-party company for fast research with a small group to quickly validate an idea and then compare the results with the A/B test (00:06:10). Gabriel Gregório provided an example from their experience working in a bank, where they implemented two-way messaging to measure the impact of payment reminders more quickly than waiting for changes to a website (00:07:27).\n\n* Qualitative and Quantitative Validation Methods Gabriel Gregório offered qualitative and quantitative methods to shorten the time to results, focusing on what works well in Brazil. Qualitative suggestions included offering discounts or pop-ups within the app for answering surveys or giving ratings, noting that Brazilians are accustomed to responding to in-app interactions and social media engagement (00:09:45). For quantitative validation, especially when traffic is limited, Gabriel Gregório suggested focusing on measurable goals like potential new users or order frequency and running campaign\n\n\n\nrozen and food for yes for who who knows I like talk to friends and sell. So we have a lot of very small business in in uh country cities in Brazil who already do what Hello Fresh do but yeah as I told you uh may probably this this small business charge a little less than maybe Hello Food will charge.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: No, but I'm talking specifically about uh good shop HelloFresh again mainly about the price point. So at which point does it become profitable for us? Um so this is why we didn't go into Brazil but generally like as a as a place as a market like it would be at some point interesting.\n\nGabriel Gregório: No, I so I just told you Brazilian have the some Brazilian have had to b like five meals,\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Oh,\n\nGabriel Gregório: seven meals and frozen and every day they just h could eating and eat because it's faster and healthy than the industrial one and they don't have time during the week. like in the Sunday they prepare all the the foods or order all the foods and storage or and bring of the for the the work or each in her house.\n\n \n\n \n\n00:17:55\n\n \n\nNikita Gorshkov: huh.\n\nGabriel Gregório: So yeah, it's very common in Brazil but it's nice and it's a premium users because people normally who has a little more money do that.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Exactly. It's that you always pay for the convenience,\n\nGabriel Gregório: Yes, because is this ones is who go to the gym so need to eat f have.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: right?\n\nGabriel Gregório: So people who go to the jeans have more money normally have more and focus more in in healthy foods. So yes normally it's the same group who who frozen food has more money to buy other things. So yeah I think we have the pro but yeah I'm not try to sell you all come to Brazil just to tell you how works\n\nNikita Gorshkov: No. Fair. Fair enough.\n\nGabriel Gregório: here.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Fair enough. I mean, we should cool. All\n\nGabriel Gregório: Yeah, I think I understand the what you looking for for a professional.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: right.\n\nGabriel Gregório: I I like the the the model business. I I search for the company. So yeah, I hope you choose me for be your partners in the close future. Oh, today thank you. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay.

Someone in BER - P89-L4-Dim Sum (Berlin Campus - Prinzenstraße, L4) and Pepijn Senders agreed that the immediate focus should be on small, high-value automatable pieces, particularly improving the design system check to ensure Figma files are \"Zestifiable,\" and packaging solutions for the handover stage within Spec Machine. The participants also aligned on conducting a pilot with customer-facing teams, treating the onboarding process as a scientific experiment, and agreed on the necessity of sitting together to review the list of teams and defined quality parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\nNotes Length: Standard\n\n* Meeting Location and Initial Check-in Adam Ghanem confirmed the location of the meeting, which is upstairs in a dimsum location (00:00:00), and briefly discussed his health and preference for sitting in a corner. Someone in BER - P89-L4-Dim Sum (Berlin Campus - Prinzenstraße, L4) checked on Adam Ghanem's health before he came (00:00:00). Adam Ghanem confirmed they were not sick and would see them in two minutes (00:00:00).\n\n* Vacation and Availability Someone in BER - P89-L4-Dim Sum (Berlin Campus - Prinzenstraße, L4) stated they would be on break the following week, using unused vacation days, and would be available but not actively working. They mentioned potentially handing over tasks to Kudlo (00:00:00). Someone in BER - P89-L4-Dim Sum (Berlin Campus - Prinzenstraße, L4) advised against being available during vacation, emphasizing the importance of turning off Slack and other work communication because the company will survive (00:00:29).\n\n* Health and Social Distancing Someone in BER - P89-L4-Dim Sum (Berlin Campus - Prinzenstraße, L4) mentioned feeling under the weather and practicing social distancing, comparing the feeling to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially due to the large number of people in the office for an all-hands meeting (00:01:31). They also shared that they were relieved to avoid catching a stomach flu from their child, who was sick for five days, which was the reason for their absence the previous week (00:02:09).\n\n* Starting the Discussion and Group Alignment Someone in BER - P89-L4-Dim Sum (Berlin Campus - Prinzenstraße, L4) moved the conversation towards the core topics, which centered on gaining alignment regarding expectations, defining a good starting point, and establishing next steps for the group, particularly on how to stay connected despite being across different alliances. They aimed to clarify the collective goals to ensure efficient time use and alignment on group boundaries (00:03:47).\n\n* GenAI Involvement in Development Lifecycle and Team Projects Someone in BER - P89-L4-Dim Sum (Berlin Campus - Prinzenstraße, L4) emphasized that the group's main focus is the end-to-end golden platinum software development lifecycle (SDLC), but GenA\n\n\n\nere and saying like AI I don't know if we should do that.\n\n \n\n \n\n01:00:34\n\n \n\nBER - P89-L4-Dim Sum (Berlin Campus - Prinzenstraße, L4): Yeah, but he's also so\n\nPepijn Senders: I can tell you exactly what Assaf thinks about this because he told me a couple times. I'll tell you what thinks about this because he told me a couple times.\n\nBER - P89-L4-Dim Sum (Berlin Campus - Prinzenstraße, L4): what?\n\nPepijn Senders: I told him it's not compatible with German workforce, especially one that's supported by a works council. Like you're not gonna make it.\n\nBER - P89-L4-Dim Sum (Berlin Campus - Prinzenstraße, L4): Yeah. Yeah. But you're I'm right. Right. So it's not we don't need to sell we don't need to sell AI adoption to to Olga or Assaf or what I've seen previously and I'm not see like where like so I've seen other companies that go through like their AI pilots their AI transformations I have like several friends that I talked to to try to understand like what did they eventually start doing so that we just start from there so that we don't figure it out from doing it and every other like person that made an initial approach where they hoped that adoption will um lead us to value.\n\n \n\n \n\n01:01:33\n\n \n\nBER - P89-L4-Dim Sum (Berlin Campus - Prinzenstraße, L4): Uh they either ended up where the pilot got shut down completely or they actually created more tech debt and more quality issues uh popped up. So what I'm trying to do really is like find like I'm not saying like we should go either extreme this way or extreme that way. I believe we have to have spec machine and all the foundational layers on the ground like everyone needs to have it because this will create the best flying wheel of we'll ever see and I'm with you 100% on that but one thing I'm worried about also that this could bankrupt us like imagine if I give an engine where people can operate agents in parallel and lo a day% I think what we're missing here is it up your average right now target goal for uh AI adoption and quality having that we need to define for Mario but for quality should be already using the parameters we need to define parameters what we define as quality that we need to define how so this we can get uh but next\n\n \n\n \n\nTranscription ended after 01:03:23\n\n\n\n\n\nThis editable transcript was computer generated and might contain errors.
