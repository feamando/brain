They talked about the contextdriven product management document, which Nikita Gorshkov is planning with Tabby for a \"quantum like jump\" transition across teams, and the use of AI in product development, where Prateek Jajoo questioned the practicality of short experimentation windows due to customer volume concerns. Nikita Gorshkov plans to send a draft markdown document for the TPT app to Prateek Jajoo, Maria, Ahmed, and DA for estimation of V0 and V1 features, and clarified that the app initiative is a broad opportunity for Prateek Jajoo to onboard and understand domains alongside Maria, before focusing narrowly on specific projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\nNotes Length: Standard\n\n* In-Office Meeting Etiquette Nikita Gorshkov and Prateek Jajoo briefly discussed the shift in acceptable in-office behavior, noting that in the past, taking meetings from one's desk was common. They agreed that current practice favors taking active participation meetings in private spaces like phone booths or meeting rooms, while passive listening is acceptable at the desk (00:00:00). Prateek Jajoo commented that the current environment feels \"much more calmer\" compared to pre-remote work times (00:01:14).\n\n* Context-Driven Product Management Prateek Jajoo expressed interest in the contextdriven product management document and their excitement about the company moving toward a single context-driven document. Nikita Gorshkov mentioned that the document represents an ideal state and requires a \"quantum like jump\" rather than an incremental change for the whole team to adopt new principles from product management to engineering and design (00:02:17). Nikita Gorshkov also stated they are working with Tabby to plan the transition from current operations to this new vision, while building out tools in parallel (00:03:49).\n\n* AI and Product Development Workflows Nikita Gorshkov shared information about the active clan genen AI channel and mentioned Alex is posting cloud code skills there, while they posted their PM automation system (PMO) which is a CLI-managed system that generated the pre-read and recaps for the current meeting (00:03:49). Prateek Jajoo liked the idea of using AI to determine what not to build through experimentation, but they questioned the practicality of short experimentation windows given customer volume concerns (00:05:07). Nikita Gorshkov admitted the difficulty of accelerating experimentation without synthetic traffic to replicate customers and mentioned that experimentation teams are resistant to the synthetic traffic idea (00:06:28).\n\n* Shortening Discovery and Scoping Work Nikita Gorshkov emphasized that the goal of the new document and AI-driven processes is to significantly shorten investigation, documentation, scoping, and corner case management loops between product, design, and engineering. The intent is to leverage the vast amount of knowledge and data available to use AI for guidance in building roadmaps and investigations within CPT (00:07:33). Prateek Jajoo provided an example from their work on the registration page, highlighting how engineering contribution on page usage can provide pre-insights for AI guidance (00:08:45).\n\n* G\n\n\n\niority\n\nNikita Gorshkov: H\n\nPrateek Jajoo: is retention or is it across growth and retention.\n\n \n\n \n\n00:17:12\n\n \n\nNikita Gorshkov: I mean to be fair I I uh put you on the app because you have some extra capacity and it's a good thing to get into like a bunch of topics. I again same as I did with Beatatric and Dio. Um my ask to uh you and Maria like look onboard yourself. Don't worry about who takes which projects right now. Um but in January get back to me and and\n\nPrateek Jajoo: All\n\nNikita Gorshkov: um yeah see like uh tell me tell me what to do.\n\nPrateek Jajoo: right.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Yeah.\n\nPrateek Jajoo: All right. I asked only because in my one-on ones there are some people who are focusing on retention like Reena specifically and she was like, \"Oh, where are you going to focus on?\" So I was\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Yeah, the the business is going to be pushing on on a clean definition.\n\nPrateek Jajoo: like,\n\nNikita Gorshkov: I am fine like I want us to be more focused on specific projects uh because I need both of you to know each other's domains.\n\nPrateek Jajoo: Got it.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Like I can't have a situation where somebody is so focused on their domain that they can't help out if something happens\n\nPrateek Jajoo: Right.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: on the other side.\n\nPrateek Jajoo: Right. Okay. Cool. Got it. Um. Yeah. All right. This is this is good for now.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Sure.\n\nPrateek Jajoo: Um, yeah. Last thing I actually just if you have a have a sec I wanted to know like the hierarchy of product management as well. So uh here there is just senior product manager staff. What's the difference between principal and\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Uh principal is the next level essentially.\n\nPrateek Jajoo: staff?\n\nNikita Gorshkov: So uh principal is director level uh IC. So we introduce principles as uh individual contributors that are um essentially Leo as a principle uh for example and he works on initiatives that are probably HelloFresh group generic for example cross-selling um like that's a major initiative across factor across hellofresh has bigger implications for uh the overall holofresh group and he's there to be the ninja that Kai cuts through all the red tape and uh pushes it through\n\n \n\n \n\nTranscription ended after 00:19:48\n\n\n\n\n\nThis editable transcript was computer generated and might contain errors.

Regarding team management, Jenna O'Shea committed to being more hands-on and coaching Mega on stakeholder management, while they also decided to bundle design critiques for New Ventures and Shopping to promote knowledge transfer and suggested involving Nikita Gorshkov or Daniel in the hiring interviews. They also discussed Nikita Gorshkov’s concern over the VMS Shopify store's templated design and \"lack of ownership,\" and established the Factor Form strategy of integrating it into Factor if the Shopify store fails.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\nNotes Length: Standard\n\n* Initial Check-in and AI Context Jenna O'Shea and Nikita Gorshkov started the meeting with a brief check-in, where Jenna O'Shea apologized for not accessing the AI pre-read due to connection issues at their new place. Nikita Gorshkov reassured them that the AI's current pre-reads may not be 100% accurate yet because it lacks past context, comparing it to a \"baby Nikita\" that is still learning and will become more accurate over time (00:00:00).\n\n* Personal Update on Baby's Sleep Nikita Gorshkov shared positive news that they had managed to sleep at the same time as their baby during their shift for two consecutive days. They explained that the baby had initially refused to sleep on any flat surface, despite advice, but they found success with co-sleeping, with the baby taking \"center stage\" in the bed (00:01:05). Jenna O'Shea congratulated them, emphasizing that what works for their family is what matters, as not \"everything is textbook\" (00:02:11).\n\n* Hiring Strategy for Good Chop Position Jenna O'Shea identified the key topic as hiring a replacement for David, and specifically, opening a mid-level position for Good Chop as soon as possible, with an intention to open it in January (00:02:11). Jenna O'Shea expressed a preference for hiring a mid-level designer to allow for long-term growth and avoid the cycle of quickly hiring and losing momentum with senior roles, given the team's seniority and the nature of the design work in that space (00:03:16).\n\n* Team Strength and Management Strategy Jenna O'Shea observed that the design team is \"really solid\" and demonstrated a strong community, citing an example of Marina onboarding Shay onto tasks despite Katrina and Pedro being out, which Jenna O'Shea identified as a leadership issue. Jenna O'Shea is committed to being more hands-on to address \"Yuri level frustrations,\" and intends to coach Mega on stakeholder management once they return in August (00:04:06). Nikita Gorshkov agreed with the mid-level hiring but emphasized the importance of the candidate being systematic in their work to avoid the previous problem of constantly designing new components instead of reusing existing ones (00:06:17).\n\n* Recommendations for Design Collaboration and Hiring Process To ensure a systematic approach, Jenna O'Shea recommended bundling design critiques for New Ventures and Shopping together, anticipating \"healthy friction\" and knowledge transfer between the system-focused HelloFresh side and the more explorative New Ventures side. Regarding the hiring process for the mid-level role, Jenna O'Shea suggested involving Nikita Gorshkov or Daniel \n\n\n\n22\n\n \n\nNikita Gorshkov: Um and then yeah with TPT honestly we have Katrina and I'm very happy with Katrina's work so far. So so far so good there. Uh, I think that's less of a prevalence. And then, yeah, uh, I'm gonna ping Shay to maybe ping you and also, you know, do a demo and things like that. What we need to solve for our factor forum subbrands are UX issues. And I think if you I don't know if you already went through some of the experiences and the funnel and things like that on factor forum. Um, but if you haven't, please do. That would be super helpful because I think you'll see what I'm talking about when me and Hamemed are saying that we need to fix the UX\n\nJenna O'Shea: Um,\n\nNikita Gorshkov: there.\n\nJenna O'Shea: so I already asked Michael, who's on factor form as point of contact, to go ahead and do an audit on that for us,\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Yeah.\n\nJenna O'Shea: like a UX audit.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Oh, yeah. Michael, sorry. Sorry, that was a mixup.\n\n \n\n \n\n00:15:23\n\n \n\nNikita Gorshkov: Michael.\n\nJenna O'Shea: Yeah. So, I mean, uh,\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Yep.\n\nJenna O'Shea: feel free to to put Yumi and Michael into a conversation and like just kind of like a closing the loop kind of statement because that is really what I would expect him to do next. He said that he had done a UX audit for factor form when he started, but then this was spinning up la. Um, so let's actually have him put that effort into this because it sounds like he has a really big appetite to be a key voice in strategy and experience experience strategy here. also seems like he's pretty experienced, so let's leverage\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Nice. Perfect.\n\nJenna O'Shea: Sweet. Okay, I have nothing urgent from my side other than like I'm still newbie, still on boarding. If there's anything I'm getting wrong or anything I need to be learning while I'm being loud in these rooms, please let me know. If there are any other rooms that I'm supposed to be in that I'm not, please let me know. From a design perspective, you'll have a little bit more visibility over who's doing what uh than before. Uh cuz I realized that the new brand's Jira board is the one that I set up sometime around 2019 2020.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Thanks. Awesome.\n\n \n\n \n\nTranscription ended after 00:16:58\n\n\n\n\n\nThis editable transcript was computer generated and might contain errors. People can also change the text after it was created.",

Michael, sorry. Sorry, that was a mixup.\n\n \n\n \n\n00:15:23\n\n \n\nNikita Gorshkov: Michael.\n\nJenna O'Shea: Yeah. So, I mean, uh,\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Yep.\n\nJenna O'Shea: feel free to to put Yumi and Michael into a conversation and like just kind of like a closing the loop kind of statement because that is really what I would expect him to do next. He said that he had done a UX audit for factor form when he started, but then this was spinning up la. Um, so let's actually have him put that effort into this because it sounds like he has a really big appetite to be a key voice in strategy and experience experience strategy here. also seems like he's pretty experienced, so let's leverage\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Nice. Perfect.\n\nJenna O'Shea: Sweet. Okay, I have nothing urgent from my side other than like I'm still newbie, still on boarding. If there's anything I'm getting wrong or anything I need to be learning while I'm being loud in these rooms, please let me know. If there are any other rooms that I'm supposed to be in that I'm not, please let me know. From a design perspective, you'll have a little bit more visibility over who's doing what uh than before. Uh cuz I realized that the new brand's Jira board is the one that I set up sometime around 2019 2020.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Thanks. Awesome.\n\n \n\n \n\nTranscription ended after 00:16:58\n\n\n\n\n\nThis editable transcript was computer generated and might contain errors. People can also change the text after it was created.",

Alison Ryan updated Nikita Gorshkov on the Shopify factor form project's success, which received approval for site launch pending redirection work, and received high praise from Nikita Gorshkov for the quick turnaround on the VMS Shopify work with Samir. Regarding the Goodchop project, Alison Ryan outlined the plan for strategy and design collaboration with Anetta, including providing branding guidelines before Anetta's two-week absence, and Nikita Gorshkov stressed the need for a unique design to avoid mirroring VMS templates. Alison Ryan also raised concerns about the Shopify storefront contract for Goodchop, noting difficulties with the unresponsive representative and the current recommendation to build a development storefront under the factor domain due to differing contract negotiations, which Nikita Gorshkov agreed to follow up on with Yuri.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\nNotes Length: Standard\n\n* Holiday Schedule Clarification Nikita Gorshkov and Alison Ryan discussed the upcoming Christmas holiday schedule, specifically an extra day off. Alison Ryan was initially unaware of an extra day beyond the 25th and 26th, which are standard days off in Canada. Nikita Gorshkov confirmed that the 24th was being granted as an extra day, potentially communicated via a group message or specific to Berlin updates, which Alison Ryan noted might extend to others within the company.\n\n* Project Success and Future Work Alison Ryan shared an update on the Shopify factor form project, confirming they received a \"thumbs up\" to proceed to site launch, pending some work on redirections, which is scheduled for the 18th. Nikita Gorshkov gave huge praise to Alison Ryan and the team, including Samir, for the quick turnaround on the VMS Shopify work, especially after the loss of Yara, describing the successful completion with one day to spare as \"very untamike\". Alison Ryan expressed excitement for the upcoming \"good chop stuff,\" anticipating a fast start due to lessons learned from the previous project and noted that the team should be able to go live by the beginning of March instead of the estimated late March date.\n\n* Goodchop Project Strategy and Branding Alison Ryan outlined the plan for the Goodchop project, including aligning documents with Samir and shaping strategy, noting Anetta will be offline for two weeks, delaying some work until the new year. A key step before Anetta's departure is providing them with branding guidelines to propose a design before the launch, which will be approved upon the team's return from vacation. Nikita Gorshkov raised concerns about the design potentially mirroring existing VMS templates, suggesting heavy collaboration with Anetta and Marina in January to ensure the good shop design is unique and pushes boundaries while meshing well with the current website. Alison Ryan agreed that they need to ensure Goodchop doesn't simply replace colors from existing brands like Butcher Box and confirmed they will work closely with Maria for template recommendations and approvals.\n\n* Shopify Storefront Contract Status Alison Ryan brought up the need for clarity regarding the Shopify contract and the plan for signing the agreement for the Goodchop storefront, noting that Yuri is trying to follow up with the Shopify representative who has been unresponsive. The current recommendation from Shopify is to build a development storefront under the factor domain and later migrate it to a Goodchop domain because the negotiations for the Goodchop contract differ significantly from Factor's previous 2024 contract. Nikita Gorshkov agreed to follow up with Yuri on the contract status and confirmed that the current contract is specifically with factor, clarifying the situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested next steps\n\n* Alison Ryan will align on documents with Samir this week and refine them next week.\n\n* Alison Ryan will share information, including branding guidelines, with Anetta this week so the team can start working on the good shop proposal before the launch.\n\n* Nikita Gorshkov will ping Yuri to follow up on the plans for signing the Shopify contract for good shop.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should review Gemini's notes to make sure they're accurate.

They discussed the customer journey, with Sameer Doda suggesting allowing customers to switch influencers to mitigate limited assortment, and Nikita Gorshkov responding that broad assortment is not currently an explicit customer request based on research signals. Sameer Doda and Nikita Gorshkov also agreed on prioritizing a quick, one-click customer journey and reviewed unit economics for minimum box size, with Sameer Doda reporting progress on the Green Chef migration and the Factor Form Shopify launch being on track for the 18th after content review with Laura and Allison, attributing successful Shopify VMS development to Allison. Sameer Doda is now preparing a strategy document for the Good Chop Shopify store and will share the VMS store with Yuri, whose team is awaiting a signed SOW for access.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\nNotes Length: Standard\n\n* Disagreement with Lineia Regarding Creator Portal and Resource Allocation Sameer Doda provided Nikita Gorshkov with a detailed account of a disagreement with Lineia concerning the Creator Facing Portal, stating that Lineia was misrepresenting resource allocation (00:01:50). Sameer Doda and Lineia had discussed that active development would start closer to the end of January, and Sameer Doda indicated that the decision to proceed without the creator portal immediately was a strategic one to move faster, not due to a resource constraint (00:00:55). Sameer Doda decided to document every conversation with Lineia to prevent future misrepresentation (00:03:48).\n\n* Customer Journey and Assortment Discussion Sameer Doda shared notes on the customer journey, with Nikita Gorshkov largely agreeing but emphasizing the need to source some information from the customer's browser or logged-in accounts (00:03:48). Sameer Doda asked for input on the strategic question of whether to allow customers to discover and switch between influencers to avoid losing a customer due to limited assortment (00:04:58). Nikita Gorshkov suggested that based on current customer research signals, broad assortment is not an explicit customer request at this time (00:06:07).\n\n* Minimum Box Size and Unit Economics The question of minimum box size was raised, with Sameer Doda noting that if a customer must select multiple recipes and the influencer's offering is limited, it could become a problem (00:06:07). Nikita Gorshkov emphasized the need to review the unit economics breakdown, particularly since the current initiative involves zero CAPEX, which significantly lowers the pain level for the cost of goods sold. Nikita Gorshkov hypothesized that the break-even point might be a larger meal kit, such as a \"dinner for three people,\" allowing for quicker market entry (00:07:05).\n\n* Customer Journey Optimization and Data Capture Both Sameer Doda and Nikita Gorshkov agreed on the priority of making the customer journey as quick and close to a one-click process as possible (00:08:12). Sameer Doda confirmed plans to explore removing operational actions, such as email or delivery address input, through express checkout and email capture for logged-in customers. Nikita Gorshkov proposed leveraging autofill for address information and social lo\n\n\n\nt of items where I which I threw at her and was like can you go and figure this out? if you can't figure this out, I'll step in and help out with this as well, but see if you can do this on your own.\n\n \n\n \n\n00:14:14\n\n \n\nSameer Doda: And she did all of those things by herself. So, actually, it's it's a lot of effort on her end, which is why when this actually goes live, I will I will actually like her to send out the launch announcement and I will work with her to create that launch announcement,\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Yeah.\n\nSameer Doda: but I will uh ask her to send it out.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Yeah, that would be very\n\nSameer Doda: Yeah.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: nice.\n\nSameer Doda: And yeah, but we just came out of call for factor form uh Shopify launch with the another folks. Everything looks green on that front and we have a call with Elvar this afternoon and then a working session between me, Laura and Allison just to go through all the content on the Shopify store uh to update any required pieces there and we should be done basically with everything today with one day to spare for any additional testing and then we go live on 18th.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Well, it's a Yeah, it's more than enough. Damn.\n\nSameer Doda: I know, right?\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Thank\n\nSameer Doda: And yeah, no,\n\nNikita Gorshkov: you.\n\nSameer Doda: thank you so much for for that feedback. And we also had a kickoff call with an art of good job. Um, we can't give them any access right now, unfortunately, because the SW is still not signed.
