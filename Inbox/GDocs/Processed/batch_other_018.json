      "content": "﻿LEGO: Unified Prospects Checkout Features and Layout for Meal Brands\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Goal\n\n\n\n\n\nOur goal is to create a single, unified prospects checkout layout with standardized features that will work centrally for all Mealkit brands (HelloFresh, GreenChef, EveryPlate, and ChefsPlate) and RTE brands (Factor and Youfoodz).[a][b][c][d][e]\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckout is a critical phase in the acquisition funnel where users register or log in, provide their address, select delivery options, and add payment details.\n\nUnified feature is a shared component that can operate across multiple countries, brands, and user journeys. Once implemented, any new functionality built on this Feature is automatically available wherever the feature is deployed, ensuring consistency across the board. Features list are available on the portal: https://www-staging.hellofresh.com/features?f=DeliverySummaryFeature\n\nModular checkout is the checkout code setup, which consists of  independent, reusable unified Features.\n\nCheckout layout is a structure for how elements are interconnected as part of it.\n\n\n\n\n\nRTE - Ready-to-Eat Brands (Factor, Youufoodz)\n\nWLMK/New Mealkits - Mealkit brands (GreenChef, EveryPlate, and ChefsPlate)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Problem Statement\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HelloFresh Group has expanded to 8 brands across 18 countries, which requires scalable solutions to avoid isolated work efforts. The prospects checkout process to purchase subscription can be identical across all brands and products, which makes it the first user experience that can be standardized and managed centrally.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2025, the activation user journey scope was transferred from TAM Alliance to Growth Alliance to centralize Checkout ownership within one team. Two brands, GoodChop and Pets Table, remain in TAM. Scope now increased to 31 distinct codes to manage (18 in HelloFresh with 6 in New Mealkits and 7 in RTE added on top). To scale further and grow sustainably, a strong foundation is needed. HelloFresh has set an 2025 objective #1 to accelerate product development velocity for Ready-to-eat (RTE) brands by distributing ownership of core customer journeys across the consumer-facing-alliances (CFAs).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Reduce Effort Needed to Checkout strategy initiated in 2024 involved refactoring the HelloFresh checkout into a modular checkout with unified features. By the end of 2024, the scope expanded to include RTE and WLML, aiming to unify features across all meal brands. More details are in Modular Checkout. The goal for H1-2025 is to complete feature modularization and unify the layouts for all meal brands. The new checkout layout will use the technical format that was created during the Single Page Checkout initiative.

You have completely different features in your conversion funnels and the reuse of the same components across all brands is part of this initiative\n\n[d]So, looking at the checkout features below, the majority of them are the same. While we have some additional features such as welcome kits and trial boxes, I think those can be built as additional components within Lego, no?\n\n[e]Of course they can be built but would need to be ready for us to launch lego as well as all differences in areas like Logistics and Fraud, for example. We've been testing for 6 months across HF and Factor and are still adding/fixing things because of all the custom logic, so this will not be an easy addition. But we can definitely assist your team in adopting Lego\n\n[f]@anupam.maurya@hellofresh.com let's add the ticket in the Epic for the items which will need to be moved to Features still.\n\n_Assigned to anupam.maurya@hellofresh.com_\n\n[g]@anupam.maurya@hellofresh.com for our layout work we would need to build this one in too right?

Did the launch move the metric? Was it the right metric? Is the lift real or just noise?\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOur Jan 14 webinar goes straight at this problem. Max will walk through a workflow showing how product teams can:\n\n\n\n* Turn raw user behavior into clear “this worked / this didn’t” signals\n\n*\n\nCompare versions without spinning up custom analysis\n\n* Learn faster without asking engineering for new instrumentation\n\n\n\nIf you’re trying to speed up how your team learns after every release, this session will be worth your time.\n\n\n\nRegister today!

Maria Chelminska provided updates  \n\non blocked initiatives, including the charger checkout being held up by  \n\nrefund issues and the reactivation page delay due to a multi-subscription  \n\nissue with the new pricing endpoint, which Nikita Gorshkov approved  \n\ntemporarily reverting to the old endpoint to secure value before the  \n\nholidays.

Alison Ryan updated Nikita Gorshkov  \n\non the Shopify factor form project's success, which received approval for  \n\nsite launch pending redirection work, and received high praise from Nikita  \n\nGorshkov for the quick turnaround on the VMS Shopify work with Samir.  \n\nRegarding the Goodchop project, Alison Ryan outlined the plan for strategy  \n\nand design collaboration with Anetta, including providing branding  \n\nguidelines before Anetta's two-week absence, and Nikita Gorshkov stressed  \n\nthe need for a unique design to avoid mirroring VMS templates. Alison Ryan  \n\nalso raised concerns about the Shopify storefront contract for Goodchop,  \n\nnoting difficulties with the unresponsive representative and the current  \n\nrecommendation to build a development storefront under the factor domain  \n\ndue to differing contract negotiations, which Nikita Gorshkov agreed to  \n\nfollow up on with Yuri.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested next steps\n\n\n\n\n\nAlison Ryan will align on documents with Samir this week and refine them  \n\nnext week.\n\n\n\nAlison Ryan will share information, including branding guidelines, with  \n\nAnetta this week so the team can start working on the good shop proposal  \n\nbefore the launch.\n\n\n\nNikita Gorshkov will ping Yuri to follow up on the plans for signing the  \n\nShopify contract for good shop.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting records Document Notes by Gemini\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the summary section in this email helpful?\n\nNot Useful Email Useful Email\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle LLC, 1600 Ampitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA\n\n\n\nYou have received this email because meeting artifacts were initiated in  \n\nGoogle Meet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Notes: “Sameer:Nikita 1:1” Dec 16, 2025\nID: 19b2811e8c5f730c\nFrom: Gemini <gemini-notes@google.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\nNotes from “Sameer:Nikita 1:1”\n\n\n\nThese notes have been sent to invited guests in your organization.\n\n\n\nOpen meeting notes\n\n\n\nThe content was auto-generated on December 16, 2025, 5:48 PM CET and may  \n\ncontain errors.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nSameer Doda provided Nikita Gorshkov with details regarding a strategic  \n\ndisagreement with Lineia about resource allocation for the Creator Facing  \n\nPortal and emphasized that the decision to delay the portal was for faster  \n\nmarket entry, not resource constraints.

Sameer Doda and Nikita Gorshkov also agreed on  \n\nprioritizing a quick, one-click customer journey and reviewed unit  \n\neconomics for minimum box size, with Sameer Doda reporting progress on the  \n\nGreen Chef migration and the Factor Form Shopify launch being on track for  \n\nthe 18th after content review with Laura and Allison, attributing  \n\nsuccessful Shopify VMS development to Allison.
