Tobias and Solenne presented this roadmap to Yoav and Annie and received good feedback about it. In the second tab of the spreadsheet we listed the priorities, with Porterhouse leading the list. Whenever we have to make a hard choice between two deliveries, we will decide for the one with the higher priority. That makes projects with lower priority more likely to be delayed than the ones with higher priority. If you have any concern of a high-priority project, please let Tobias and Solenne know as soon as possible.\n\n💻 Tech Initiatives\n\n                                                                                                                                    * The BFF migration in the mobile app is almost almost almost complete. We can expect the initiative to be complete early next week. There are still some cleaning up to do on web and mobile.\n\n                                                                                                                                    * Last week we implemented a proof of concept of how we can migrate route access control to react components, and this we started with the migration of the access control function for the Cancellation page. By the end of next week, we should have also migrated the Delivery Tracking and RaF routes.\n\n💸 Additional Vouchers\n\nOne of Engagement's sprint goals is to support Additional Vouchers in our price calculation logic for web and mobile. This week we started working on the website, refactoring the voucher Redux logic (🍝) and implementing the action to fetch a subscription's additional voucher info.\n\n🔪 Killing Alice\n\nThis week we removed the last API call to Alice: update payment method in web. Before Alice is really killed in Intfood (expected mid April), we will need to do a force update of our mobile app to prevent users from using old versions that are still using the old endpoints.\n\n🛒 Add-ons\n\nThe Happiness team started to implement some changes for Add-Ons, and was able to setup some add-ons SKUs in staging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n—\n\nPrevious Notes Location: https://www.notion.so/New-Brands-Retention-Weekly-Notes-c227bcddd153472f841114c2603de18d",

This section does not impact the maximum number of pages]\n\nReview Meeting Date: Oct 16, 2025\n\nAttendees: Jama MusseCho HwangAnnie MeininghausCho HwangHolger HammelDominik RichterEd BoyesAssaf RonenLaurent GuillemainSeb TronFabien SimonAdriana VillarBrian Leung\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways, Decisions, and Next Steps:\n\n1. Alignment needed with Adam Park on plan for Factor Programs, as it fell below the line for Q4 and Q1. Does this need to be reprioritized? Done, we have agreed to keep momentum on physical product as well as planning ahead of Q2 development relaunch \n\n2. Factor Tech prioritization list created by Adam Park needs to be reviewed against the backlog of the MD squad. Done, we have reviewed the incremental asks, and have pulled them into Ed squad prioritization, and flagged items already in YP’s \n\n3. Lack of analytics resourcing was highlighted as risk for New Ventures, Annie and Jama to take away and come back with Analytics resourcing plans for New Ventures We have added 1 incremental PA resource to the New Ventures domain space, and will be looking to move additional temporary capacity to reduce the outstanding backlog \n\n4. Factor Form should better connect their products to customers  goals to create a “personalized performance stack”. Jama to connect with Adam Park on this plan We have added this for exploration in Q3 plan \n\n5. An aligned strategy should be created on how Loyalty should work for the New Ventures, and should this connect to the New Loyalty strategy set to launch in Q2-Q3 We will be looking to leverage the New Loyalty program when it launches, so we have therefore moved loyalty for Pets Table back by 1 quarter into Q3   \n\n6. Cross Selling for other brands outside of HelloFresh and Factor is below the line for 2026 to be revisited for 2027 planning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges requested to the Yearly Plan during Draft Reviews. Please update before submission for final YP approval:  \n\n* Move Loyalty on Pets Table by 1 quarter to Q3 to leverage  New Loyalty program launch \n\n* App Launch for Pets Table to become contingent on results of Elysium and ABBA app launches (both financial and performance KPIs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tI. Organizational Overview\n\nMission and Focus areas\n\nThe New Ventures team aims to surprise and delight customers by bringing to life never-before-seen physical and digital products, changing the way everyone thinks about food. The domain scope for new ventures includes: Good Chop - delivering US consumers premium, locally sourced proteins via a digital butcher experience; The Pets Table - delicious and nutritious human-grade pet food for pet parents for all budgets and sizes & the Factor sub-brand Factor Form - supporting customers on their path towards holistic wellness and achieving their health goals;  Market Innovation - bringing customers brand new experiences across markets reinvigorating our relevance in their eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Organizational Structure\n\nThe funded fixed HC for the New Ventures is 50. The management structure consists of 1 Director of Engineering (Daniel Arias) and 1 Director of Product (Nikita Gorshkov). Over the course of Q4 teams will settle into the new squad structure.  Overall New Ventures have self-funded with the exception of +2 from Growth to fund the Market Innovation squad.  *Final 2026 HC budget is under review with Finance and Portfolio given the recent org changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment/Tribe\n\n\tLLeader\n\n\tNumber of Squads\n\n\tBudgeted HC (Locked Business\n\n\n\na\n\n[d]@anne@hellofresh.com Theresa Stolberg has begun conversations with the markets this week for 2026, we will work with her on the plans there.\n\n[e]_Marked as resolved_\n\n[f]_Re-opened_\n\nWhy does it need to be country by country and not a global launch ?  \n\nVoice dictated by Assaf \n\n \n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n[g]The technology is available globally, the rollouts are happening as the countries define their occasions and setup and procure the SKUs.\n\n[h]what would you like to see here but aren't right now? @lgui@thepetstable.com\n\n_Assigned to lgui@thepetstable.com_\n\n[i]1. Multipet checkout improvements (direct impact on improving AOR)\n\n2. Increasing add on % of net revenue through add on subscribe & save, product marketing & UX (goal to increase add ons as a % of NR from 1% to 5% in 2026)\n\n3. Other CVR initiatives e.g. testing other qus in the quiz (previous pet food, neutered/spayed, etc), personalised value reinforcing stats, etc\n\n4. RAF initiatives on Tiered credit based on loyalty; RAF social proof & CVR improvements -> one of our goals for 2026 is to step change RAF\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team have this long list of initiatives and we will prioritise them through our quarterly planning.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key thing is that we are resourced to tackle the vast majority of these and we've aligned on the resourcing for that. I can share with you in our call on Tuesday\n\n[j]Aligned with Laurent on this, we have a good understanding of the overall capacity needs with the team based on the available initiative roadmap; this particular table/format was not aimed to be exhaustive of all of the work we aim to deliver in 2026.\n\n[k]whats most painful to see not on the list @yt@hellofresh.com @set@hellofresh.com\n\n_Assigned to yt@hellofresh.com_\n\n[l]all key topics are in here. \n\n\n\n\n\none stream that's not present in here but we have as part of objectives and currently actively exploring is modernized CX leveraging AI: we are now looking at a few solutions that would augment CC, support sales funnel with live Q&A as well as retention flow (i.e. replace cancellation flow with native chat experience and go off the cancellation reason - solution) - this would need team support (data ingestion, PM steering, etc)\n\n1 total reaction\n\nNikita Gorshkov reacted with 👍 at 2025-10-16 15:52 PM\n\n[m]@anne@hellofresh.com fyi\n\n_Assigned to anne@hellofresh.com_\n\n[n]@jama.musse@hellofresh.ca - if you want to use this",
