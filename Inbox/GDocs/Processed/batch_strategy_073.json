Objective: Transition from single year  to a  long-term (3 year) financial forecast, while also maintaining our role as current “partner/enforcer” to ensure HFG will  realize at least €500m of AEBIT and €400m FCF (post leases) in 2026\n\nMeasure of success: We have sensible core metrics (AOR, CAC, conversion growth, PC2 and capex) in our Adaptive budget for 3 years in all markets, aligned local and central leadership. For 2026 the most important single measure of success is our P&L and cash flow statement, where we target to achieve €500m in AEBIT and €400m in FCF (post-leases). \n\nObjective Owner:  Helge Doering\n\nInvestment Type: New    |   HFG Top 5 Strategy Impact:  5. Efficiency Program/Cost to Serve \n\nDescription: We are moving to a three-year vision for our key metrics to secure long-term stakeholder commitment, which is updated each budget cycle based on latest developments. The systems to support this mostly exist but might need some improvements. Our main focus now is on stronger enforcement and team education. Looking beyond 2026 and using the foundation built by the GTO AEBIT cockpit, Finance and GTO will improve the planning process with a 3 year plan  with functional leaders to ensure key initiatives are captured and the business is steered with both a near and long-term vision by SMT leaders.\n\nWhile ultimately achieving the objective 2026 is more driven by business functions, Finance and the AEBIT cockpit/GTO are partners for most Top 5 Strategies, with a special focus on Strategy 5 (efficiency program). A key part  will be > €1B spend flowing through Workday Procurement to ensure proper controls. The items Finance will deliver or partner with stakeholders for are:\n\n* Clarify with leaders existing and incremental targets for 2026, actions and timings to achieve them. This will entail: \n\n   * Overachieving >300 mEUR+ cost savings target communicated externally, incl. 100 mEUR+ overhead savings\n\n   * Paid Gross CCV/CAC+D of 0.95 (incl. 5% blended AOR uplift), single digit conversion growth and mPC2 (% of GR) of 46.5% for the Group. Group capex (including capitalized tech expenses) of below €150m\n\n* To achieve the above goals, Finance will: \n\n   * Collaborate and challenge the business through tailored reporting of discretionary costs,  eg.  personnel costs, T&E, cost centers (esp. Multimarket reporting like Nexus) and take over responsibility for indirect personnel cost controlling from AEBIT cockpit in 2026\n\n   * Ensure proper tracking of progress and enforcement of cost saving programs, including reconciliation between cockpit and P&L impact in budget / actuals\n\n\n\nIf decisions are made (e.g. more capex, lower procurement savings) that result in not achieving near-term targets or that materially impact the 3-year plan, they must be approved by the Group CFO and include analysis validating the trade-off. \n\n\n\n\n\n2. Objective: Improving accuracy and agility of forecasting vs. 2025 for both weekly cost reporting and monthly actuals to GCR\n\nMeasure of success: Primary metric is an AEBIT variance of MEC to GCR of less than 5% or \n\n\n\nis analyst reports and peer company content). Additionally, we have encouraged individuals to experiment with Gemini on their own and expect these individual experiments will impact our project list as the year progresses.  Many  opportunities are in the scoping and data gathering phase including using historical general ledger data to build estimates and to perform quick analysis on large data sets - if successful these efforts will allow us to close the books faster.  Two examples we have already implemented include: we reduced the MEC call attendance in the US by more than 50% and instead we create and distribute  a podcast based on Gemini notes; we’ve used Gemini to reconcile large data sets with no unique identifier where a many to one match based on $ amount was required.\n\n\n\n\n\n   2. What are you doing to improve the customer experience?\n\nAs a support function our customers are internal stakeholders across HF  and our shareholders. Focusing on our internal customers, the most important things we can do  are related to DO #1 (proactively analyzing and identifying opportunities for function to improve, and holding them accountable to do so) and DO #2 (accuracy of real-time financial data to drive business decisions).  In addition, doing so in a low friction way is critical to limit the finance burden on other functions\n\n   3. What are the known risks or obstacles to achieving these objectives?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two general risks to achieving our objectives. The first has to do with general business performance (regarding  AEBIT, FCF, downside ad hoc). For the most part, these are business functions driving the value and Finance accurately tracking. We can assist with accuracy intramonth via GCR to MEC. The second, which is understandable, is our objectives are not always ‘top of mind’ across the business. As examples, Objectives #2 (Accuracy) and #3 (Efficiency) will need to be accomplished without substantial support from Tech, which is generally focused on commercial teams. Another example is #5, where it is often hard to prioritize risk mitigation activities and ensure those on the front lines (e.g. AP at risk of fraud) always “stay frosty” to threats.\n\n\n\n\n\n   4. What objectives would MDs and other key stakeholders be most disappointed to have left out for 2026? \n\n\n\n\n\nWe shared our Domain Objectives with several executive leaders  and nothing was flagged.",

Aggregators) with the option of an  instant purchase as a meal kit ‘fulfilled by HelloFresh’.\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-term Vision (Later) \n\nTransform HelloFresh into the “Spotify for food”  a platform where any creator can share a recipe that HelloFresh fulfills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEssential Navigation Hub\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\n\tDocument / Asset\n\n\tLinks\n\n\tOwner\n\n\tBrief\n\n\tWorking Backwards Document (WBD)\n\n\tWBD: Influencer Marketplace\n\n\tNikita Gorshkov\n\n\tPlanning\n\n\tRoadmap + Sprint Plan\n\n\tInfluencer Marketplace – Source of truth\n\n\tAnnette MvdE\n\n\tDesign Assets\n\n\tFirst idea Prototype\n\n\tMagic Patterns Project\n\n\tMarc\n\n\tExploration Prototype\n\n\thttps://www.magicpatterns.com/c/snrle459ny2nbifqud45sw\n\n\tAnnette MvdE\n\n\tMVP\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tShay Obaidullah\n\n\tDesign Assets\n\n\tFlow charts\n\n\tMiro\n\nPassword: InfluencerMarketplace2025\n\n\n\n\n\nFigma\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAnnette MvdE\n\n\tResearch\n\n\tUser Research Plan & Assets\n\n\tIXI Research Plan: Influencer Marketplace\n\n\tKatheryn Eckles\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\nStakeholder Landscape (DACI)\n\nRole\n\n\tDepartment\n\n\tContact\n\n\tRituals\n\n\tSponsor\n\n\tSLT\n\n\tEd Boyes\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDriver\n\n\tCommunication #influencer-marketplace-driver\n\n\tWeekly  + async slack update\n\n\tExperience Strategy\n\n\tAnnette MvdE (Berlin: GMT+2)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBusiness Strategy\n\n\tMelanie Schwindt (Toronto: GMT-4)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTech Execution\n\n\tWanderley Teixeira (Toronto: GMT-4)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOperation Strategy\n\n\tMelanie Schwindt (Toronto: GMT-4)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tApprover\n\n\tCommunication #influencer-marketplace-stakeholder\n\n\tBi-weekly: Gated Decision end of sprint with 60-minute presentation of validated work, key risks, and GO/NO-GO approval to proceed to the next phase + async slack update\n\n\tKey Approver\n\n\tIan Brooks (Toronto: GMT-4)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tExperience St\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Score recipes based on clear formatting and completeness, and surface this as a reliability meter.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Automatically flag recipes missing critical info (times, measurements, yields).\n\n\n\n\tWireframe\n\n\t  \n\n\n\n\t  \n\n\n\n\t  \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\nPrototype Test\n\nPrototype for evaluating the concept\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[a]@katheryn.eckles@hellofresh.com I think this part is important, people might be interested in purchasing this meal but maybe not in that moment.
