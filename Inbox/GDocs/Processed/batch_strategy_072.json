      "content": "﻿TAM Product: GenAI Ways of Working\n\n \n\nTAM Product: Context-driven Product Management\n\n\tSummary: In 2025, thanks to the growing maturity of AI-based tools and products, the tech industry shifted from theoretical possibility to practical necessity of integrating AI into the daily processes of employees; HelloFresh as well has actively engaged into the exploration, deployment and integration of AI-based tools into the workplace across functions. This document aims to offer each product manager within TAM an easy step-by-step guide and inspiration on how your daily workflow can (and should) change through the integration of AI into every step of your daily workflow.\n\n\tCreated At: Aug 20, 2025\n\n\tLast Updated: Sep 16, 2025\n\n\tStatus: Review\n\n\tAuthor: Nikita Gorshkov\n\n\tAI Use: Yes\n\n\tContributors: \n\n\tBased On: GenAI: MVP Product Workflow Automation (Draft)CFA GenAI Adoption 2025GenAI: Strategy for Design WorkflowsTAM Product: GenAI Ways of Working\n\n\t\n\n\n\nProblem\n\nDelivery, efficiency expectations of leadership across HelloFresh generally and HelloTech in particular is being recalibrated to address the reality of AI-augmented staff capabilities; simply put - more and faster will be expected from every team member; that would stretch everyone if not mitigated by automation of intelligence-based repetitive work through AI integration.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples\n\nThe principles for the new AI-enabled product manager ways of working are grounded in the core principles of the New Model proposed by Assaf Ronenon 16.09.2025: \n\n1. Customer First: Every decision must begin with the customer and be anchored in satisfaction, retention, and lifetime value.\n\n2. One Global System: Wherever possible, we will converge on unified tools, processes, and standards, eliminating duplication.\n\n3. Speed and Agility: We will shorten decision cycles and empower leaders to experiment, learn, and scale quickly.\n\n4. Clear Accountability: Each decision will have a single owner with the authority and responsibility to deliver outcomes.\n\n5. MD-Integrated Organization: Managing Directors (MDs) own the P&L for each geography. Central functions must be responsive, enabling local experimentation while ensuring it aligns with globally defined systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nThe solution to the growing problem of increased expectations is not only the training and learning of effective use of individual tools by product managers; but ensuring all individual tools can be combined into a comprehensive process, ensuring that core components, assets, artefacts, tools, best practices are reused, expanded, sustained and followed, empowering individuals to achieve peak performance within this new age. It’s important to establish a set of core principles that should be guiding your work: \n\n\n\n\n\n1. You are responsible: whatever you do and whatever you create and submit - there is no substitution from your personal responsibility, your content, data, findings, priorities etc. that might be generated by an AI are, at the end of the day, your responsibility. \n\n2. AI isn’t the end-all-be-all: AI can do some things well, others brilliantly, a lot - not so well, it is up to you to balance where to use AI, there is (despite the hype) no (and cannot be) any substitute for your creativity, passion, quality and communication - you are you with AI or without. \n\n3. Product principles are here to stay: our product principles, ways of thinking about customers and their problems, data and KPIs, goals, solutions and strategies are still as relevant as they were before - they will enable you to benefit from the new capabiliti\n\n\n\nu are reporting out on - ensure that all MAR/QARs and tactical reports are added into the NotebookLM for your team - share the NotebookLM with the team and stakeholders. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis document is not aimed to be comprehensive or cover every single aspect of product management and the SDLC process, this is not only impossible, but also would assume a static reality where processes and approaches would not change. Especially right now - that is not the case. We are all in a world where a new technology is changing the way we all work, this technology is in its infancy and lacks strong product cases, integrations and has existing limitations; this situation is similar to where product management was when the iPhone 1/2 were released - nobody knew where and how the technologies would evolve, how this changes product management and the products that we build; the key right now is for you to remain curious, flexible and quick - don’t focus too much on existing products and tools, focus on building your comfort level when working with GenAI, understand the fundamental benefits and limitations of the technology, ideate, experiment and try new things, build confidence when working with it and know where it’s particularly strong. \n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the most important piece to remember is that this is just a technology, it’s up to us, humans to define how we use it and be responsible for the outcomes that we are able to achieve with it. Even in the last couple of weeks as this document was being written, more and more it became apparent that human input, guidance and effort is not going anywhere to ensure that we solve problems for other humans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemp: Notes\n\nNote 1: add context-driven/spec driven development concepts\n\n\n\n\n\n[a]Do you also mean by this that basically with making sure that everything is contextually described, the product manager should also know exactly what's in production because they can see the context that was used to generate certain production features?\n\n[b]Yes, I don't expect that the product manager has the complete understanding of every single feature, but, I am expecting that a product manager orchestrates that the context of their domain is clear, maintained and relevant.\n\n[c]1 total reaction\n\nLeo Lee reacted with ➕ at 2025-09-26 14:06 PM\n\n[d]Love this!\n\n1 total reaction\n\nNikita Gorshkov reacted with 🎉 at 2025-09-18 11:46 AM",

Aggregators) with the option of an  instant purchase as a meal kit ‘fulfilled by HelloFresh’.\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-term Vision (Later) \n\nTransform HelloFresh into the “Spotify for food”  a platform where any creator can share a recipe that HelloFresh fulfills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEssential Navigation Hub\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\n\tDocument / Asset\n\n\tLinks\n\n\tOwner\n\n\tBrief\n\n\tWorking Backwards Document (WBD)\n\n\tWBD: Influencer Marketplace\n\n\tNikita Gorshkov\n\n\tPlanning\n\n\tRoadmap + Sprint Plan\n\n\tInfluencer Marketplace – Source of truth\n\n\tAnnette MvdE\n\n\tDesign Assets\n\n\tFirst idea Prototype\n\n\tMagic Patterns Project\n\n\tMarc\n\n\tExploration Prototype\n\n\thttps://www.magicpatterns.com/c/snrle459ny2nbifqud45sw\n\n\tAnnette MvdE\n\n\tMVP\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tShay Obaidullah\n\n\tDesign Assets\n\n\tFlow charts\n\n\tMiro\n\nPassword: InfluencerMarketplace2025\n\n\n\n\n\nFigma\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAnnette MvdE\n\n\tResearch\n\n\tUser Research Plan & Assets\n\n\tIXI Research Plan: Influencer Marketplace\n\n\tKatheryn Eckles\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\nStakeholder Landscape (DACI)\n\nRole\n\n\tDepartment\n\n\tContact\n\n\tRituals\n\n\tSponsor\n\n\tSLT\n\n\tEd Boyes\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDriver\n\n\tCommunication #influencer-marketplace-driver\n\n\tWeekly  + async slack update\n\n\tExperience Strategy\n\n\tAnnette MvdE (Berlin: GMT+2)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBusiness Strategy\n\n\tMelanie Schwindt (Toronto: GMT-4)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTech Execution\n\n\tWanderley Teixeira (Toronto: GMT-4)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOperation Strategy\n\n\tMelanie Schwindt (Toronto: GMT-4)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tApprover\n\n\tCommunication #influencer-marketplace-stakeholder\n\n\tBi-weekly: Gated Decision end of sprint with 60-minute presentation of validated work, key risks, and GO/NO-GO approval to proceed to the next phase + async slack update\n\n\tKey Approver\n\n\tIan Brooks (Toronto: GMT-4)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tExperience St\n\n\n\n                                                                                              * Add a “Verified Original Recipe” badge for content created and tested by the influencer.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Score recipes based on clear formatting and completeness, and surface this as a reliability meter.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Automatically flag recipes missing critical info (times, measurements, yields).\n\n\n\n\tWireframe\n\n\t  \n\n\n\n\t  \n\n\n\n\t  \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\nPrototype Test\n\nPrototype for evaluating the concept\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[a]@shay.obaidullah@hellofresh.ca\n\n[b]@katheryn.eckles@hellofresh.com i wonder if this would be a simple Q&A section or a crowdsourced Q&A\n\n[c]would we need to create a hellofresh shop with all influencer recipes to shop and the influencer itself advertise it?",

      "content": "﻿v0.2: Action\n\nAI Bytes: Taking Action (v0.2)\n\nAuthored by Adam Ghanem on Aug 11, 2025 - based off of strategic directive actions & suggestions through Ebrahim Kargar, Priscila Koeck Machado, Pepijn Senders, Sherief Helaifi-Chadha, Nikita Gorshkov , Leo Lee, Marlene Rosner & more. The point of this document is to start.\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\nA few things have substantially evolved ever since the writing of the v0.1 of this and several other documents have been spun-off across the organization aiding in driving action.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this document is to keep things simple and talk about the required next actions in order to start effectively mobilizing to make progress towards our ambitions & desired outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr: what has changed since v0.1 was written?\n\n1. New Team in CSA & The Capacity Wars: Consumer Foundation tribe has been founded in Consumer Services Alliance with the aim of bringing in previous CFA foundational teams closer to the CFAs’ alliance group. This includes a team named “Consumer Acceleration” [a][b]over which they will take responsibility of GenAI Integration - spearheading the integration of GenAI into the product development lifecycle for consumer-facing experiences, including requirements definition, UX/UI design, development, localization, and testing – the team is packed with key top big bets till EOY which makes our operating model choice a key lever in defining our success – enter the ‘capacity wars[c]’.\n\n2. Sourcing v0 by Vercel for Prototyping[d] Evaluation WIP: Additionally, Priscila Koeck Machado is also evaluating the need for enabling AI prototyping and currently investing along with the support from Pepijn Senders & co in evaluating v0 by Vercel, a tool designed to simplify website creation by allowing users to describe their ideas in natural language, which it then translates into code and user interfaces. This will help designers & product managers bring their ideas to life in fully interactive prototypes and this could potentially aid in speed of handover from product → engineering.\n\n3. Sourcing QA Testing Automation[e] Tested & Path Forward: Sherief Helaifi-Chadha & Co have experimented with Spurtest, an AI-driven quality assurance (QA) tool designed to automate website testing. Tests have been conducted and now we’re going to be prioritising validating potential for further expansion of the experiment to other HelloTech teams and expanding scope of arrangement with Spur. Priscila Koeck Machado will be helping us expand & define a playbook of best practices & adoption plans, this will enable us to better detect issues and automate our QA testing. Speed remains still an issue with Spur which is something that requires to be evaluated and also consider opting into an alternative that could potentially leverage open source alternatives such as Playwright or other setups.[f]\n\n4. Agents Platform[g][h][i][j] Coming Soon! Pepijn Senders & Priscila Koeck Machado kicked us off on AI Agents Platform Working Backwards - 2025/Q3 (should be available to a certain degree around the end of September/through October) - will be a key enabler in bringing easier access to agents and agent experimentation at scale. Not a blocker but rather an amplifier and removes user barriers.\n\n5. How might we automate our product workflows? Nikita Gorshkov: documented an overview of his ambition as a product leader what he wishes to enable GenAI: MVP Product Workflow Automation (Draft) – building on top of what was started off by Leo Lee & Marlene Rosner here Empowering Product & Design Teams Across the 5D Loop Through \n\n\n\nceives opportunities / highlight existing painpoints so we can determine where to start\n\n1 total reaction\n\nAdam Ghanem reacted with 👍 at 2025-08-11 15:17 PM\n\n[r]Could you elaborate a bit more on this? What is the expectation? Why is this method better?\n\n[s](discussion point)\n\n[t]@adam.ghanem@hellofresh.com note to self to add a column in the following tables to highlight relative priority of items using our existing frameworks for priority\n\n_Assigned to adam.ghanem@hellofresh.com_\n\n[u]@ekar@hellofresh.com this is necessary - this will become the foundation for everything else - one thing that is actionable is to start with this and use it to kick-off the base components of the \"Library\"\n\n[v]should it be a Gem/GPT you can chat with and get advice from on how to live the tenets?\n\n[w]We can virtually AI enable anything across these - that's part of the core tenets we should abide by\n\n[x]reminds me of the Data Literacy campaigns we used to do, might be worth having a look at that for inspiration. There was a central team driving it who would push information. There were also quizzes, certifications, workshops etc. Might also be worth thinking about what the AI-powered version of that would look like\n\n[y]this all makes sense as a start, but it ironically feels quite old school - sharing info by text. The problem with that is that no one has time to consume all the information being pushed to them. Is there an alternative way to solve this problem in a world of GenAI?\n\n[z]this all makes sense as a start, but it ironically feels quite old school - sharing info by text.

But given current HC constraints, where would this \"group of squads\" come from?",
