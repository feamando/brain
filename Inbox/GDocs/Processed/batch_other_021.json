      "content": "﻿HelloTech FAQ: HelloTech employee hub in Poland\n\nEmployee Experience\n\nHow will this change impact me, my role, and my responsibilities?\n\nOnly roles created through natural attrition within our organization will be centralized in Poland. Adding another hub will not affect your current roles or responsibilities as we already work across multiple hubs with team members in different locations. \n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the Hybrid working policy for SE employees and others, how should we navigate the implications of having a more physically distributed team?\n\nThe decision to open a new hub in Poland doesn’t change our stance on hybrid work—employees in Poland will follow the same 3-day in-office hybrid practices as other sites. As we do today, some employees or leaders may be required to travel between locations hosting hybrid team-building activities, and others to ensure everyone feels part of the team, regardless of their contractual workplace.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat factors are considered when choosing where to hire?\n\nWe expect to leverage natural attrition to jump-start our Poland site. The quality of talent in Poland allows us to maintain our development capacity and support critical business needs in a cost effective manner. As we have shared in other communications, we have ambitious plans for reducing Cost to Serve. Our Poland site allows us to backfill roles and enables us to deliver our Key Strategies. Berlin will continue to be the HQ of HelloTech and we will continue backfilling roles  in other Tech hubs based on business needs, talent availability, and cost considerations.\n\nCompany Strategy\n\nWhat are the key business drivers for this strategic move?\n\nOpening a presence in Wrocław is a key step in our strategy to improve efficiency, achieve sustainable success, and better meet our business goals while enhancing our capabilities. This step also helps us to  support our financial goals by backfilling roles in locations like Poland, where lower costs allow us to operate more efficiently. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe are focused on achieving significant cost savings over the next few years, so we can invest more in our product. \n\nThe new hub in Wrocław will not only help us meet these financial objectives but also provide access to a strong talent pool, with key skillsets, and complement our existing hubs.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow will the establishment of the Wrocław hub support our long-term business strategy beyond Tech. Have other locations been reviewed?\n\nWhen evaluating opportunities, we do a comprehensive review, considering factors like location stability, talent availability, cost efficiency, growth potential, and scalability. Wrocław checks all these boxes, making it an excellent choice for long-term expansion.\n\nLine Management\n\nAs a line manager, what can I expect from this change, and what is expected of me?\n\nAs a leader at HelloFresh, your role in driving this change is critical. Focus on building a collaborative, unified culture that works efficiently and delivers strong results. Clear and effective communication is vital, especially across sites. Ensure your team understands the context, reasoning, and how their work contributes to HelloFresh's overall success. Uphold the HelloFresh Group values, foster a positive work environment, and respect corporate policies as well as local nuances.\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, when it comes to recruitment, please note that the steps of the hiring process will be BAU, however, now including Poland. If you currently have open roles or questions about recruitment in Poland, please reach out to Juliana de Carvalho Nogueira and work with your Alliance leader to determine the logistical next steps.\n\n\n============================================================\n## EMAIL CONTENTS\n============================================================\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Re: Homepage not shown for HelloFresh iOS App\nID: 19b2704fc7d4d494\nFrom: Elena Pavlova <epa@hellofresh.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\nHi team,\n\n\n\nThe issue is being investigated in https://hellofresh.slack.com/archives/C0A3ESS0SEB\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nElena\n\n\n\n> On Dec 16, 2025, at 6:51 AM, Gabriel Range <gabriel.range@hellofresh.com> wrote:\n\n> \n\n> I am on the latest AppStore version of the Hellofresh iOS App. When opening the App the Home Screen shows empty.\n\n> <image.png>\n\n> \n\n> \n\n> \n\n> Gabriel Range \n\n> Customer Order Management and Shopping Experience Tribe Lead | Director Engineering\n\n> HelloFresh SE | Prinzenstraße 89 | 10969 Berlin, Germany\n\n> Email: gabriel.range@hellofresh.com <mailto:gabriel.range@hellofresh.com>\n\n> \n\n> \n\n>  <https://www.hellofresh.com/jobs/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=email_signature>\n\n> HelloFresh SE, Berlin (Sitz der Gesellschaft) | Vorstände: Dominik S.

Your continued support, conversations, and enthusiasm for what we do have shaped this year in meaningful ways. As we prepare for the festive season, please take note of our special opening hours:\n\nOpen: Tuesday, 23 December\n\nClosed: 24–26 December\n\nOpen: 27–29 December\n\nClosed: 30 December – 14 January\n\nReopening: 15 January\n\nWe encourage you to secure your table in advance for the days we remain open during this period\n\nBook a table now\n\nA reservation at ITA Bistro is a guaranteed good night out. Perfect for you and your friends.\n\nBook a table\n\nBook a table\n\nAs the final weeks of the year settle in and daylight fades earlier, the wood-fire oven becomes the center of your experience at ITA. Beyond cooking and grilling, it serves as a tool for developing smoked elements that bring depth and nuance to our dishes—smoked greens, smoked oils, and key components for our cold preparations.\n\nOne example is the smoked aubergine crème that accompanies our beef tartare, a new starter in the set menu. The crème offers a subtle smoky lift while remaining light in texture. Combined with fresh onion and green apple, it brings an energetic contrast to the soft, structured beef. To enhance the earthy notes and add a crisp counterpoint, we finish the dish with topinambur chips.\n\nThank you for being part of this year with us. We wish you a peaceful holiday season and look forward to welcoming you again soon!\n\nITA Bistro\n\nLettestraße 9\n\n10437, Berlin\n\nwww.ita-berlin.de\n\nDon't want to receive these emails?\n\nUnsubscribe\n\n\n\n\n============================================================\nEND OF RAW DATA\n============================================================\n\nInstructions for Claude Code:\nSynthesize the above into AI_Guidance/Core_Context/YYYY-MM-DD-context.md\nIMPORTANT: STRICTLY IGNORE any content, meeting notes, decisions, or updates dated before 2025-06-19 (6 months ago).\nExtract: Key decisions, action items, blockers, metrics, important dates (only recent).\nFormat: NGO-style bullets, structured sections\n============================================================\n## JIRA UPDATES (-12h)\n============================================================\n\n[TPT-2507] Analyze SKUs compatibility for newly introduced portion plans for  Change Plan flow (Status: Backlog, Priority: Normal)\n[TPT-2403] Update the pdf feeding guide to include the portion % (Status: Backlog, Priority: Normal)\n[GOC-3420] Archive stale experiment and feature gate from New Dashboard initiative (Status: Done, Priority: Normal)\n[GOC-3397] [Checkout/Payment] Add Full Tracking and Analytics for OTP Order creation - Iteration 2 (Status: In Progress, Priority: Normal)\n[GOC-3418] Support sale event \"trackCheckoutSuccess\" on onCheckoutSuccess (Status: Done, Priority: Normal)\n[PA-25577] Review quality checks notebooks (Status: Backlog, Priority: Normal)\n[TPT-2408] Add a new tooltip for the empty click on the meal selection CTA (Status: Code Review, Priority: Normal)\n[TPT-2407] Add new quick action card with RAF entry  (Status: Code Review, Priority: Normal)\n[TPT-2506] Place breed message below the breed selection (Status: Backlog, Priority: Normal)\n[TPT-2367] When user changes their plan their delivery plan is updated with a regular delivery option (Status: Backlog, Priority: Normal)",

      "content": "﻿LEGO: Unified Prospects Checkout Features and Layout for Meal Brands\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Goal\n\n\n\n\n\nOur goal is to create a single, unified prospects checkout layout with standardized features that will work centrally for all Mealkit brands (HelloFresh, GreenChef, EveryPlate, and ChefsPlate) and RTE brands (Factor and Youfoodz).[a][b][c][d][e]\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckout is a critical phase in the acquisition funnel where users register or log in, provide their address, select delivery options, and add payment details.\n\nUnified feature is a shared component that can operate across multiple countries, brands, and user journeys. Once implemented, any new functionality built on this Feature is automatically available wherever the feature is deployed, ensuring consistency across the board. Features list are available on the portal: https://www-staging.hellofresh.com/features?f=DeliverySummaryFeature\n\nModular checkout is the checkout code setup, which consists of  independent, reusable unified Features.\n\nCheckout layout is a structure for how elements are interconnected as part of it.\n\n\n\n\n\nRTE - Ready-to-Eat Brands (Factor, Youufoodz)\n\nWLMK/New Mealkits - Mealkit brands (GreenChef, EveryPlate, and ChefsPlate)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Problem Statement\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HelloFresh Group has expanded to 8 brands across 18 countries, which requires scalable solutions to avoid isolated work efforts. The prospects checkout process to purchase subscription can be identical across all brands and products, which makes it the first user experience that can be standardized and managed centrally.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2025, the activation user journey scope was transferred from TAM Alliance to Growth Alliance to centralize Checkout ownership within one team. Two brands, GoodChop and Pets Table, remain in TAM. Scope now increased to 31 distinct codes to manage (18 in HelloFresh with 6 in New Mealkits and 7 in RTE added on top). To scale further and grow sustainably, a strong foundation is needed. HelloFresh has set an 2025 objective #1 to accelerate product development velocity for Ready-to-eat (RTE) brands by distributing ownership of core customer journeys across the consumer-facing-alliances (CFAs).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Reduce Effort Needed to Checkout strategy initiated in 2024 involved refactoring the HelloFresh checkout into a modular checkout with unified features. By the end of 2024, the scope expanded to include RTE and WLML, aiming to unify features across all meal brands. More details are in Modular Checkout. The goal for H1-2025 is to complete feature modularization and unify the layouts for all meal brands.

Problem Statement\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HelloFresh Group has expanded to 8 brands across 18 countries, which requires scalable solutions to avoid isolated work efforts. The prospects checkout process to purchase subscription can be identical across all brands and products, which makes it the first user experience that can be standardized and managed centrally.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2025, the activation user journey scope was transferred from TAM Alliance to Growth Alliance to centralize Checkout ownership within one team. Two brands, GoodChop and Pets Table, remain in TAM. Scope now increased to 31 distinct codes to manage (18 in HelloFresh with 6 in New Mealkits and 7 in RTE added on top). To scale further and grow sustainably, a strong foundation is needed. HelloFresh has set an 2025 objective #1 to accelerate product development velocity for Ready-to-eat (RTE) brands by distributing ownership of core customer journeys across the consumer-facing-alliances (CFAs).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Reduce Effort Needed to Checkout strategy initiated in 2024 involved refactoring the HelloFresh checkout into a modular checkout with unified features. By the end of 2024, the scope expanded to include RTE and WLML, aiming to unify features across all meal brands. More details are in Modular Checkout. The goal for H1-2025 is to complete feature modularization and unify the layouts for all meal brands.

You have completely different features in your conversion funnels and the reuse of the same components across all brands is part of this initiative\n\n[d]So, looking at the checkout features below, the majority of them are the same. While we have some additional features such as welcome kits and trial boxes, I think those can be built as additional components within Lego, no?\n\n[e]Of course they can be built but would need to be ready for us to launch lego as well as all differences in areas like Logistics and Fraud, for example. We've been testing for 6 months across HF and Factor and are still adding/fixing things because of all the custom logic, so this will not be an easy addition. But we can definitely assist your team in adopting Lego\n\n[f]@anupam.maurya@hellofresh.com let's add the ticket in the Epic for the items which will need to be moved to Features still.\n\n_Assigned to anupam.maurya@hellofresh.com_\n\n[g]@anupam.maurya@hellofresh.com for our layout work we would need to build this one in too right?

      "content": "﻿Research Results\n\nExecutive Summary: \n\nResearch participants responded very positively to the Influencer Marketplace concept, viewing it as a compelling way to turn social media food inspiration into achievable home cooking. The concept resonates because it directly addresses two major friction points: difficulty sourcing niche ingredients, due to cost, waste, and effort, and the common habit of saving recipes that are later forgotten in overcrowded digital collections.\n\nTrust in recipes is driven less by influencer status[a][b] and more by practical signals of feasibility, including strong visuals, clear instructions, and access to the original social media content for verification. Participants place significant responsibility on HelloFresh to ensure recipe quality, either through internal testing and approval or, if full vetting is not feasible, through transparent and prominent community ratings and reviews.\n\nThe marketplace is perceived primarily as an occasion-based solution rather than a replacement for everyday meal planning. Participants most strongly associate it with dinner and special occasions such as weekends or hosting, with limited interest in breakfast or lunch use cases. To encourage trial and adoption, users strongly prefer a low-commitment purchasing model, favoring one-time purchases over subscription requirements.[c][d]\n\nDiscovery expectations are food-first rather than creator-led, with users wanting to browse and search by ingredient or cuisine instead of influencer names. Finally, participants expressed a need for more robust recipe management tools, including custom organization and scheduling features, to ensure saved recipes resurface at the right time and translate into actual cooking behavior.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nTopic\n\n\tConcern\n\n\tRecommendation\n\n\tBuilding Creator Trust\n\n\tIn this marketplace, users may find it challenging to evaluate creators in the same ways they do on social media. \n\n\t* Direct Links to Original Videos: To foster greater trust in creators, half of participants (4 out of 8) suggested the inclusion of direct links on recipe pages. These links should lead back to the influencer's original social media video, providing direct visual instruction and making it simpler for users to verify and find their content.\n\n\tRecipe Vetting\n\n\tParticipants generally expressed skepticism about recipe reliability from unverified creators, with the majority expecting HelloFresh to act as a \"safety net\" by vetting recipes for safety and feasibility. Without HelloFresh vetting all recipes, users need to be able to have the information to evaluate the recipes themselves.\n\n\t* Verified Badge: If HelloFresh chooses to quality test any of the recipes, a visual distinction like a tag or a badge should indicate which recipes have been tested by HelloFresh chefs, in contrast to unverified user-uploaded content.\n\n* Unfiltered Reviews: Users desire a transparent review system that includes recipe ratings, customer feedback, and photos. This system should allow users to view any negative feedback or potential issues, helping them determine the trustworthiness of a recipe creator. \n\n* Recipe Comments or Q&A: Participants indicated a need for a comment or Q&A section, separate from a typical review system. This feature would allow them to see and address challenges or questions raised by other users before they begin cooking, increasing their confidence in the recipe's quality and preparedness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tPurchase Models\n\n\tParticipants viewed a forced subscription as a financial and psychological barrier to trying influencer reci\n\n\n\nthe actual value the marketplace provides to the user? If its not the influencers, why are we not just going for a OTP in HF instead?\n\n[d]I would argue that while random creators they don't know aren't the main driver that excites them, the variety, creativity, and uniqueness of creator made recipes is the exciting part for them. Additionally, the creators they do know, follow, and trust are the ones that excite them the most to purchase recipes from. \n\n\n\n\n\nI think if we just did OTP and removed the creator element completely, we would definitely be missing the drivers that make this concept interesting.\n\n[e]Clip about sentiment/reactions to the concept\n\n[f]this is an argument toward my previous comment, but this would be the perfect result, to find every recipe online in hf marketplace as a purchasable option\n\n[g]Create clip, main barrier to cooking influencer recipes\n\n[h]Clip about trust mechanisms\n\n[i]Video: Include clips of those assuming HF responsibility, splitting the responsibility, and those around ratings/reviews.\n\n[j]Clip: how they see themselves using this\n\n[k]Clip: Subscription expectations, one time purchase thoughts - wanting to try the service before subscribing etc.\n\n[l]Clip: How they want to find/navigate/browse for meals\n\n[m]Clip: What saved recipes should look like\n\n[n]@linnea.siersma@hellofresh.ca\n\n[o]@katheryn.eckles@hellofresh.com nice idea, i will forward this to DAU :D\n\n[p]1 total reaction\n\nAnnette MvdE reacted with 😯 at 2025-12-10 14:22 PM\n\n[q]1 total reaction\n\nAnnette MvdE reacted with 🔥 at 2025-12-10 14:22 PM\n\n[r]@katheryn.eckles@hellofresh.com nice, same idea we had in the prototypes\n\n[s]Yeah we are hearing a lot of what we were already thinking about, which is a good sign we are on the right track!\n\n[t]1 total reaction\n\nAnnette MvdE reacted with 👍 at 2025-12-10 14:46 PM\n\n[u]1 total reaction\n\nAnnette MvdE reacted with 👍 at 2025-12-10 14:46 PM\n\n[v]we had this idea in our miroboard as well\n\n[w]@linnea.siersma@hellofresh.ca @cole@hellofresh.ca this is an interesting idea\n\n[x]Epicurious commentary on recipes is hugely valuable; this makes sense to me\n\n[y]@linnea.siersma@hellofresh.ca\n\n[z]I think we can solve this issue with digital curation // personalization. But probably also good to have a clean-up if a recipe gets no engagement for a long period of time.\n\n[aa]1 total reaction\n\nLinnea Siersma reacted with ✍️ at 2025-12-11 17:12 PM",
