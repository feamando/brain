Summary & High-Level Overview Tab: These tabs serve as the central strategic hub. It outlines context and brief customer flows for each major use case (e.g., Good Chop, Seasonal Boxes) to give a quick understanding of the customer journey. It also synthesizes the Key Functionalities that need to be built across all these different use cases.\n\n2. Individual Use Case Tabs (e.g., \"Experience - Good Chop\", \"Experience - Seasonal Boxes\"): Each of these dedicated tabs dives deep into a specific product or initiative. They break down the requirements by Milestones (e.g., MVP - Milestone 1), providing a clear roadmap from a use case perspective. The requirements are listed with User Stories and Acceptance Criteria format.\n\n3. Dependency Tab: These tabs are used to identify and detail any specific work or information required from dependent Tribes and alliances.\n\n1. Summary View of the Solution Proposed\n\nThis initiative aims to deliver a One-Time-Purchase (OTP) capability experience across HelloFresh Group brands. As of June 2025, across HelloFresh, several use cases had been identified—such as event-themed seasonal boxes, curated selections of specialized items (e.g., premium meat and seafood from Good Chop), items from a broader marketplace of third-party CPG brands, or ready-to-eat meals from sister brands like Factor—as standalone purchases, without the necessity of an active weekly meal kit subscription for that particular transaction (though OTP may also complement existing subscriptions).\n\nThe solution involves creating a seamless OTP user flow within each participating brand's digital platform. This includes clear product discovery for OTP-eligible items, transparent pricing and benefits, distinct OTP cart[a] and checkout processes, appropriate order management for both new and existing customers (subscribed, paused, or cancelled), and downstream capabilities such as delivery management and data.\n\nThis foundational OTP capability will initially be piloted and rolled out for:\n\n1. 2025 Initiative Rollouts: \n\n   1. Seasonal Boxes across HelloFresh (similar to the ANZ model but integrated).\n\n   2. Good Chop offerings for both prospects and actives.\n\n   3. Factor Form item based OTP purchase\n\n2. 2026 Potential Targets:\n\n   1. A 2-Way Marketplace on a selected HelloFresh brand (e.g., Green Chef US pilot) (potential PoC in Q4 2025) \n\n   2.

This experiment will create a Shopify storefront to offer products through both one-time purchases and flexible subscriptions.\n\nThe primary objective is to create an new marketplace for Good Chop customers to order products in a flexible way that fit additional needs. With the marketplace, we hope to gain insights into how product uptake, order habits, customer lifetime value, and impact on subscription retention differ than the existing experience. We will also evaluate the operational lift and cost-effectiveness of this new channel.\n\nStrategy Review\n\nGood Chop is launching a new marketplace experience built on Shopify to offer customers flexible ordering, such as one-time purchases and item-based pricing. The test will help us get quick learnings and build confidence on initiatives not easily testable in our current tech infrastructure, such as item-based pricing. Furthermore it will focus on targeting customers entering specific channels (eg via SEM when prospects search for specific cuts).\n\n* Phase 1: Launch with item-based pricing and a traditional e-commerce experience to establish baseline performance metrics. \n\n* Phase 2: Introduce a \"subscriptions + save\" option and compare its performance against both OTP and the current subscription model.\n\n* Phase 3: Scope and goals will be determined based on the comprehensive results from Phases 1 and 2.\n\nImplementation will be handled in partnership with an external team (Anatta) ensuring a streamlined and rapid setup of the Shopify marketplace.\n\nSuccess will be evaluated based on core metrics, including CAC, CVR and AOR. We will also track user journey analysis, CLV and product uptake to identify any performance differences for specific protein cuts in an e-commerce context. The assessment of this new channel will focus on its operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the problem we’re trying to solve?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\n\n\nWho is the target customer? What will customer experience be?[a]\n\n* The primary focus for this Shopify Storefront is to capture new customers whose profiles align with the established Good Chop customer personas.\n\n* However, the scope is not exclusively limited to entirely new customers. We recognize the value of driving traffic and potential conversions from a broader audience. Therefore, we will not restrict access or promotional offers to customers who may already have an existing account, a currently active subscription, or a past subscription history with Good Chop.\n\n* The strategy is to leverage the new storefront experience to:\n\n1. Acquire New Customers: Specifically target individuals identified by our marketing segmentation as being an ideal fit for the Good Chop brand and product offering.\n\n2. Re-engage Former/Existing Customers: Allow existing or previous subscribers to easily interact with the new storefront, potentially leading to new, additional, or reactivated subscriptions.\n\nThis inclusive approach ensures we maximize the reach and impact of the new Shopify storefront across the entire potential customer spectrum while remaining focused on the core objective of new customer acquisition.\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomers have the ability to maintain their current account / subscrtioins experience today, as well as explore and order from the Shopfiy marketplace. \n\n\n\nsting Factor Customers)\n\n* Primary Focus: Synergy & Convenience.\n\n   * Tone: Familiar, convenient, value-add, and focused on integration with existing routines.\n\n   * Core Message: Complete your routine. Factor Form supplements are designed to perfectly complement your weekly Factor meals and optimize your wellness goals.\n\n   * Key Value Props: \"Add to your existing subscription,\" \"Checkout in one click,\" \"Formulated to pair with our meal plans.\"\n\nC. Brand Alignment\n\nThe visual identity (logos, colors, fonts) must be identical across both platforms to maintain a single, cohesive Factor Form brand, regardless of the user's entry point. The only distinction should be the functionality and the audience-specific messaging.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Data Strategy\n\nThe goal is to establish a single, unified source of truth for Factor Form performance data while avoiding direct integration with existing HelloFresh dashboards to minimize integration complexity and alignment overhead.\n\nData type \n\n\tApproach\n\n\tFinancial performance\n\n\t Will be aggregated manually (by downloading Shopify reports and summing them with Factor data).\n\n\tUsage tracking\n\n\tFor MVP, we will support a simple GTM install. More advanced usage tracking will be done directly on Shopify or Shopify plugins\n\n\tExperimentation\n\n\tNo integration with Statsig. Any A/B test will be run and analyzed directly on Shopify or Shopify plugins\n\n\tUser feedback\n\n\tSince HelloFresh uses Sprig but Sprig is not on Shopify, any customer feedback needs will be managed directly on Shopify or through Shopify plugins\n\n\tProduct ratings and reviews\n\n\tHandled through 3rd party Shopify plugin, yotpo.com \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[a]@sameer.doda@hellofresh.ca this whole section was written oct, when we yet aligned on excluding traffic between sites. We will need to edit, to reflect out recommendation to exclude or not. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a open question for Yury to decide on, so we need to showcase both options.\n\n[b]We dont have a STRICT timeline\n\nWe want to go live in Q1\n\nLaunch in March, to get insights before Q2\n\nAt Minimum 2 weeks, for campaigns to have an insight into performance\n\n[c]not sure how this works or what we use for GoodChop today...\n\n[d]elevar?\n\n[e]will need alignment with Nikita\n\n[f]pulled from email with Nikita. Needs work / clarity.\n\n[g]Will need support from Yury / team to confirm this\n\n[h]TBD with alignment from Yury / team\n\n[i]this maintains?",
