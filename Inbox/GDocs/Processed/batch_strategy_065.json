HOW: Background & Operating Model Evolution Revising\n\n2. WHAT: Focus for 2025 & beyond Active\n\n3. ORG: Target tribe structures for 2025, 2026 & beyond Parked\n\n\tWhat needs to be reviewed?\n\n\tWhat do we need feedback on?\n\n* Open questions for later\n\n* … \n\n\tBackground & Operating Model Evolution\n\nand how we plan to use that to set our strategic objectives for YP2025 & beyond…\n\nPurpose of document\n\nIn this document we at tempt to provide a high-level overview of the current tribe, its domains, operating model and challenges. We use those inputs along with the help of a bit of refinement of our operating model and introducing a bit of terminology to help us steer our focus for key investments for 2025. This doesn’t serve as a replacement for the YP2025 but rather as a strategic starting point to help us align within our tribe & externally with our stakeholders on (a) our ambition, priority and appetite across our owned domains, as well as (b) use this is as a chance to refine our mission, vision and operating model for the tribe as we head in 2025 & beyond. \n\nCurrent Structure & Domains (Platforms) Owned\n\n🔬Vision ⇒ \"Core actions\" can be completed at all times, quickly and with minimal frustration, even as HelloFresh's business grows.\n\nCore actions: log in, register account, save address, activate/reactivate/cancel plan, calculate price, place order, manage delivery plan, manage/schedule delivery\n\n🎯Mission ⇒ Build a reliable, high-performing and scalable backend to power HelloFresh’s core actions.\n\nDomains we own ⇒ customer authentication, customer account management, customer address, subscription, order, deliveries, delivery plan and price calculation; we also maintain Intfood (“Bob”) and API-v2\n\n  \n\n\n\nOperating Model\n\nIs there any additional context I need to be aware of to help me better understand the operating model?\n\nConsumer Core, operating as a backend-only tribe, is responsible for the invisible yet critical processes and systems powering HelloFresh's customer experience. Our current architecture, mostly based on legacy monoliths (Bob, API-v2, Intfood) and databases, while functional, limits our ability to rapidly innovate and scale. The complexity of the existing codebase and the shared database structure pose significant challenges to both development agility (27% lower LTTC than other services when working on the monoliths), system performance (TTR for monoliths is at 138 min vs. 97 min for other services) and minimizing our security risks (TK CVEs that can’t be addressed due to X)[a] [source].\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we modernize, we must support both legacy and new systems simultaneously. This dual support significantly increases our KTLO (Keep The Lights On) workload beyond allocated resources (30~50% sprint over sprint average goal miss-rate), frequent timeline shifts and increased legacy system incidents & issues. These factors often slow our modernization efforts, as we sometimes need to prioritize short-term gains (e.g. Project Bolt, Next Day Delivery Activations UK Launch, Free Breakfast for Life) over long-term improvements. Balancing immediate business needs with strategic modernization remains a key challenge, underscoring the urgency of our initiatives to streamline and update our systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n add strategies in incremental – that says like some fraud prevention enhancements with problems to be solved\n\n[bd]Added this for discussion\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are we making sure we have clients aligned to start consuming newer APIs like Plans API instead of subscription API from legacy systems.\n\n[be]@adam.ghanem@hellofresh.com to update after:\n\n1. Scorecards of status quo established\n\n2. Gap analysis\n\n3. Target maturity for 2025 established based on YP exercise\n\n_Assigned to adam.ghanem@hellofresh.com_\n\n[bf]this already exist\n\n[bg]Can you expand on what you mean here by this?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my mind here, I am referring to the ability for a customer to be able to:\n\n1. Schedule an ad-hoc order delivery\n\n2. Select meals for that delivery\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will allow customers to either:\n\n1. Place one time orders whenever they'd like\n\n2. Place and schedule one time orders throughout the week as well\n\n[bh]@ahus@hellofresh.com while we wait for your answer, I assume that what is currently supported is to  create an order without a subscription, and what Adam is referring to would add a new delivery to an existing subscription. \n\nIs that the case?\n\n[bi]@adam.ghanem@hellofresh.com what is the difference between placing an order whenever they'd like and throughout the week? (1 and 2?)\n\n[bj]I just mentioned it here for now based on little input I got from Augusto so that we just don’t forget about it. \n\n\n\n\n\nI believe the mapping exercise you have scheduled for tomorrow would clarify _some_ of the ambiguity here of the necessary capabilities :) so would hold off any technical analysis needed at this point & see after tomorrow’s workshop how best for articulate this\n\n[bk]For context, the original idea that Augusto mentioned is being able to have multiple deliveries scheduled automatically in a week\n\n[bl]Shouldn't this be a pricing strategy that has a dependency on the subscription/plans domain?\n\n[bm]Pricing the subscription is – the ability to build a subscription using building blocks is a \"subscriptions\" domain concern – this is still open for discussion though and still early here\n\n[bn]@ahus@hellofresh.com the starting point or need is pricing monetization driven -- we can discuss which team is more suited to build this.\n\n[bo]who are consumers of this?\n\n[bp]I am just putting it as a placeholder here – I am not sure if this is something that was ever done before but not sure who should do it\n\n\n============================================================\n## EMAIL CONTENTS\n============================================================\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: GoodChop meet Anatta Delivery Team\nID: 19aef773ebf557d8\nFrom: \"Nirav Sheth | Anatta\" <nirav@anattadesign.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\n​Yuri/Seb,\n\nI want to introduce you to our managing director Emily and project\n\ncoordinator Nichole.

Nikita Gorshkov confirmed the leadership for  \n\nthe creator platform/marketplace will be Lineia Serisma for product  \n\nstrategy, Cole Banning for growth, and Melanie Schmidt for project  \n\nmanagement, with an MVP focused on simple, occasion-based boxes for one-off  \n\npurchases via social media.

Sameer Doda detailed their  \n\ninvolvement in the complex Good Chop Shopify project, the DACH Juices  \n\nsupport project for Nordic markets that requires a technical solution, and  \n\nthe Influencer Marketplace, which needs an MVP path forward due to varied  \n\nstakeholder views and already has design progress with Shay; Sameer Doda  \n\nand Nikita Gorshkov agreed on a simple one-time purchase customer journey  \n\nfor the MVP, but Sameer Doda raised concerns about limitations with  \n\napplying vouchers and selling add-ons, which Nikita Gorshkov suggested  \n\ndiscussing with Jama, and both acknowledged a need for more frontend  \n\ndevelopment resources.

Key discussions involved the shift to React Native, Appio  \n\ndeprecation, the high priority of multi-region readiness for Project 500,  \n\nand the need to prioritize Snowplow implementation for personalization  \n\nsignals, which currently lacks ownership despite being a blocker for meta  \n\nbacklog items.
