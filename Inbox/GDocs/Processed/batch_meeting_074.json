Note: We’re the first team migrating a monorepo with stateful sets to FTCP, so no platform guidelines exist yet.\n\n   * Enable Price Testing for TPT: We scoped the work and broke down the tasks.

The team put in substantial effort to address feedback in the Factor TZ feedback channel, ensuring most inputs were incorporated. We’re also refining the website and mobile apps following the Mobile UAT completion, with focused improvements to ensure we’re fully prepared for the public launch on November 7, 2024.\n\n                                                * The HelloFresh NL (English multi-language) support project is making strong progress, with project timelines now fully aligned with the Statement of Work (SOW) document.

(Of course, there were many more!)\n\nB2B: You’ve ramped up an entire new business from scratch and even convinced our Management Board that B2B does work. All the challenges you took from navigating a lot of unknowns, ambiguity, and a new tech stack is nothing short of phenomenal. You’ve created partnerships all along. Bringing a brand new vertical from zero to hero is something to be proud of, especially given that the impact of this work is now becoming visible externally from HelloFresh. As Monasin put it aptly during our AHM - it’s the first time in HelloFresh history that a commercial team admits openly “we need to catch up”. \n\nGood Chop: Tripling the size of your business, doesn’t come for granted. Though you did! Your fast pace, adaptiveness, and dedication made Good Chop into a brand which is larger than many of our international markets. You did this while tackling significant macro headwinds (inflation and customer behaviour changes) in a vertical, which is unknown to most customers. Moreover, the Good Chop brand and its technology have consistently been the innovation driver for the whole group with HelloFresh. What you have built has heavily influenced many global concepts, experiments, and experiences.\n\nPet Food: Launching a new brand (another new vertical!) and making it the fastest-growing new vertical in HelloFresh history is something that we didn’t dare to dream of when joining HelloFresh. Your contributions have played a pivotal role in positioning us in this market. and making a positive impact on pet nutrition in the US. That gave us strong conviction that you have the superpower to scale the business into new heights. Way to go!\n\nX-Brand: The work done on X-Brand has been groundbreaking. It's a testament to your ability to push boundaries and embrace challenges. X-Brand is more than just a one-time project; it represents our collective force to pioneer and innovate and the first foray into moving HelloFresh from a mealkit business to a truly comprehensive food service provider for the households worldwide. \n\nAfter all, we know that it was not only easy-peasy. As a team, we reasonably debated green bananas, challenging deadlines, coming to the office, desk availability, and more. We highly appreciate the openness, controversies and candor each one of you has brought to the table. We felt that we matured as a team in several regards. We hope you feel so, too. Most of you joined us in 2021 or 2022. We went into 2023 with a shift from New Brands Retention to New Ventures as well as with some question marks. Now, it is one year later. We seem to have found a rhythm and better feeling of how to organize ourselves.\n\nWe are excited to onboard together with you into 2024. We wish you a wonderful Christmas time and a Happy New Year.\n\nNikita & Tobias\n\n  \n\n\n\n2023-W50 (Dec 15)\n\n👪 Team and People Updates\n\n                                                                           * The engineer on-call next week is Shujath!\n\n                                                                           * Congrats Ahmed for 6-years anniversary! 🎉\n\n🐶 Pet Food\n\n                                                                           * This week we are continuing to prepare for the add-ons launch in January, as well as improving the two end-to-end tests to make sure we’re well-prepared for peak.\n\n💼 Multi-Venture Platform\n\n                                                                           * B2B Bulk Ordering Service (BOS). 1) This week the team generated SCMx file via BOS for the first time and stopped using semi-manual process for SCMx file generation 🚀 2) We added runbooks and the Grafana monitoring dashboard to address outstanding Operational Readiness Checklist points.\n\n                                                                           * This week the team came together to discuss the Squad Health Check results.

In the migration process we discovered and fixed more than 50 small errors caused by components using un-existing theme styles. Having the theme implemented with TS will give us more safety when migrating components to Zest and removing unused theme styles, and it’s one of the prerequisites for the eventual extraction of this theme out of the whitelabel space (breaking down the monolith!)\n\n                                                                           * We’ve started a learning program called Tech Toaster: Frontend Career Development (details). It's a 6-session journey where experienced colleagues will share insights and mental models to empower Frontend engineers.

The unified Registration page was disabled temporarily to fix the issue, while the team investigates what the problem is and why this wasn’t caught when enabling Single Question.\n\n                                                                                                * Mealkit Unification: the Unified Checkout Delivery Address Form is ready to go live!

This feature allows the users to enter their email right after they finish the quiz (as opposed to during signup), which will register their email in our database and help us get in touch with them even earlier and lower our CAC.

With this we have introduced four new categories: ‘Deals of the month’, ‘Essentials under $20’, ‘Buy 2 get 1 free’ and ‘Value Bundles’. Previously we only had one category, which caused customers to be overwhelmed, as we have an extensive number of add-ons.

Next week, the team demos to Ed and sets up a presentation with static data. On the backend side, progress has been made implementing the /clone endpoint in Customer Management Service and calling downstream services (APIv2, Payments Token Service, Login) for the actual cloning. Given the remaining story points and observed pace, the final integration of frontend and backend seemed unlikely for CW32. Therefore, the release was pushed to CW33.\n\n2023-W29 (Jul 21)\n\n👪 Team and People Updates\n\n                                                                                                * The engineer on-call next week is Shujath!\n\n🐶 Pet Food\n\n                                                                                                * We are still working on the early email capture, expecting to finish it next week\n\n                                                                                                * We have started researching our next big feature which is multi-pet, we want to allow users to be able to order food for multiple dogs.

Next sprint we aim to do the last rollout, which is adding the UMK Trustpilot component.

The main reason is because these brands have some unique data and features (delivery cadence, pet profile, trial box etc.) and these aren’t factored into the existing HF CRM events. Also it’s not recommended to fix these issues in the original CRM events since these events serve all brands inside the company and they’re meant to be generic. So instead we want to build a new service that triggers events with the specific data that the NV brands want\n\n                                                                                                * We recently found out that several teams throughout HF (inside and outside of TAM) are interested in building some sort of profile service that’s meant to extend the customer in some way (E.g. a customer taste profile). Since we already have a similar use case implemented in TPT (nutritional-profile-service) we’ve reached out to try to come to one unified solution that everyone can use. This is still in the brainstorming phase but the goal is to allow us to collect more information about the customer beyond what is currently available in the customer object, and different services can get this information in order to improve the customer experience (e.g. personalize their recommendations)\n\n💻 Other Tech Initiatives\n\n                                                                                                * X-Brand Signups: The copy endpoint in Payments Token Service is fully functional now.

TAM currently supports 13 different website domains, each one with their own set of Page Rules that implement CDN caching, redirections and proxies to S3. Adding a rule to start caching a new page requires modifying 13 different files. To solve this problem, we created a `whitelabel-rules` terraform module that contains all shared CloudFlare configuration. While moving CDN configs from each domain module to the shared module, we are also migrating Page Rules to their new and improved version: Cache Rules.\n\n2023-W21 (May 26)\n\n🕊️ Whit Monday\n\nThe upcoming Monday (May 29th) is public holiday in Berlin.\n\n👪 Team and People Updates\n\n                                                                                                * The engineer on-call next week is A-DOS!

Since yesterday morning we have CDN caching metrics of our HTML pages in all our frontend HoneyComb traces. Before, the only way to get some basic cache metrics was by going to CloudFlare’s dashboard and doing some low level queries. With the new HoneyComb data you can calculate cache hit ratio of any web page, and compare performance metrics between cached vs non-cached response - spoiler alert, the difference is huge! Below is the LCP of the whitelabel Plans page, where you can see the non-cached responses are 3 times slower than the cached ones. With this data, we hope that teams will take a look at their caching metrics and implement improvements.\n\n  \n\n2023-W19 (May 12)\n\n👪 Team and People Updates\n\n                                                                                                   * The engineer on-call next week is Bolo (with Thursday and Friday covered by Shujath)!\n\n🐶 Pet Food\n\n                                                                                                   * This week the team was mostly worked on resolving bugs and UI discrepancies found during UAT.\n\n                                                                                                   * Fede and Vini wrapped up their last tasks supporting TPT launch and getting back to their boring stuff.

Desi will be working alongside Daniel on the WL side to do the root cause analysis. Once we have more understanding on what caused this issue we plan to relaunch our pricing test. Further information can be found in the post mortem.\n\n                                                                                                         * This week we had an initial discussion to outline how we want to move forward with our tribe level KRs regarding latency and availability. We will start the investigation in the upcoming weeks.\n\n                                                                                                         * Found an issue regarding clearing user’s one-off change when updating preference which affects trial-box. Workaround was implemented for TPT and there’s an ongoing discussion to make this change for all countries\n\n⚙️ Backend\n\n                                                                                                         * Set & Forget: Launch is delayed for a week due to some TPT last minute changes.\n\n                                                                                                         * TPT: exposing delivery cadence on CRM which only works for TPT.

By doing this, the config for the current country and environment is resolved in the server side instead of dynamically in the client side. Client-side dynamic resolutions of configs is bad because not only the React app will need to load a JS chunk that has the entire config object, the Config Provider will delay the rendering of its children to the client side, making the user experience much slower. We found more than 20 WL config projects that are not being correctly resolved on the server side: https://ui.honeycomb.io/hellofresh/datasets/traces-frontend-live/result/75wJVMh4EGS. We ask all teams to take a look at this list and fix them ASAP.\n\n2023-W16 (Apr 21)\n\n👪 Team and People Updates\n\n                                                                                                         * The engineer on-call next week is Himash\n\n                                                                                                         * This week the Good Chop team had its first Squad Conference 🎉We got together for three days in the office to collaborate, brainstorm and do some fun activities.

This problem was mostly happening on our Image component, since NextJS is wrapping images with span tags. This week we wrapped the NextJS image component with an ErrorBoundary to reduce the blast radius of the problem, and to reduce the Sentry log level to warning. The root problem will be fixed with the NextJS 13 upgrade, but in the meantime we wanted to reduce the noise caused by it.\n\n\n\n\n\n2023-W12 (Mar 24)\n\n👥 Team and People Updates\n\n                                                                                                               * The engineer on-call next week is Bolo\n\n🐶 Pet Food\n\n                                                                                                               * Finished the voucher implementation for TPT\n\n                                                                                                               * Signup page completed\n\n                                                                                                               * Checkout pages still in progress\n\n                                                                                                               * As communicated last week we are delaying the launch date, the new date for Friends & Family launch is 1st of May\n\n💼 Multi-Venture Platform\n\n                                                                                                               * Our team is currently working on implementing the B2B Bulk Ordering service.

The tribe achieved the lion’s share (89%!) of its OKRs with flying colors, innovated both within our domains (e.g. New Recipe Cards) but, crucially, also drove innovation across HelloTech (Staging for Non-Techies). If we look back at where the tribe started it would be hard to imagine how successful Good Chop would be by now, how easy to use and engaging would EveryPlate and Factor become for their customers. Even at the very last days of 2022 you managed to deliver huge improvements for our customers - Trial Box and Subscribable Add-ons. \n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to your efforts we go into 2023 with incredibly ambitious goals that we know we will be able to achieve! We look forward to working side by side with you in the coming year and wish you Happy Holidays and a Happy New Year! \n\n\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nTobias & Nikita\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n☎️ On-Call Schedule\n\n                                                                                                               * 2022-W52 (Dec 26 - Jan 1): Alex\n\n                                                                                                               * 2023-W01 (Jan 2 - Jan 8): Max\n\n                                                                                                               * 2023-W02 (Jan 9 - Jan 15): A-DOS\n\n                                                                                                               * 2023-W03 (Jan 16 - Jan 22): Mateusz\n\n                                                                                                               * 2023-W04 (Jan 23 - Jan 29): Vini\n\n2022-W50 (Dec 16)\n\n👥 Team and People Updates\n\n                                                                                                               * The engineer on-call next week is Bolo.\n\n                                                                                                               * Ahmed and Val will be on a very well deserved vacation until the end of the year\n\n\n\n\n\n🔂 Subscription\n\n                                                                                                               * The team was working on last Subscribable Add-ons projects tickets.\n\n                                                                                                               * We fixed DeliveryFeed not showing menus in the new year (2023) app issue and were able to release it via Codepush.\n\n                                                                                                               * The team is prepared to roll-out the FJ Week Visibility feature (showing 3 weeks ahead for meal selection) to 100% of FJ US customers on Monday (Dec 19th).\n\n                                                                                                               * The team hosted Squad Health Check this week.\n\n🥩🎁 Good Chop\n\n                                                                                                               * Trial Box: Referral conversions increased by +300% in the first week of launch 🚀🌠.

Definition of “critical” is a framework to allow everyone independently to decide on the urgency of an issue. When being on the fence, assume the higher criticality. There is nothing wrong with triggering a critical and concluding in hindsight that it was not critical. Failures, criticals, incidents, and post-mortems are a great source for learning, let’s embrace them, even if it feels sometimes like a “little too much process”.\n\n2022-W19 (May 13)\n\n👥 Team and People Updates\n\n                                                                                                                        * The engineer on-call next week is A-DOS\n\n                                                                                                                        * On Wednesday Alex, Tobias and I did our 2022 Q1 Quarterly Quality Review (QQR) to Yoav, Davor and Monasin.

Last month, Fede described this problem and proposed a solution in this RFC. This week a first proof of concept was implemented: a web toolbox command that exports pull request metadata from Github to a Google Spreadsheet. We will be implementing another toolbox command to do something similar with JIRA tickets, which we will eventually use to calculate Change Failure Rate by counting JIRA bug tickets and merged Pull Requests. This kind of tools open up a lot of possibilities, if you have an idea of something we could start tracking please let Fede know!\n\n2022-W09 (Mar 4)\n\n👥 Team and People Updates\n\n                                                                                                                              * The engineer on-call next week is Fede.\n\n                                                                                                                              * Tuesday is a public holiday in Berlin\n\n                                                                                                                              * Max, Desi, Himash, Vini and Tobias are off on Monday\n\n                                                                                                                              * On the Meal Choice side we have many people on vacation next week.\n\n                                                                                                                              * Yarra off Mon-Wed\n\n                                                                                                                              * Guhan and Ahmed off the entire week\n\n                                                                                                                              * Our tribe raised 570€ to buy food and medicine for the Ukraine donation drive at work.

The problem was fixed after reverting a Soft Login change introduced the previous week. We already created a HoneyComb alert that would trigger when the number of newsletter un-subscriptions is below an abnormal threshold, and we will be implementing E2E tests to prevent this issue from happening again.

Then more GreenChef US-UK mixups were detected. The issue was caused by a GTM refactoring done by the frontend infra team, that mixed the GTM ids of both countries. A hotfix was released around 3am fixing the problem.

Then we worked together on improving our existing `build-dependency-tree` toolbox command to sort page dependencies by the number of commits that change them - this will allow us to be more data-driven when prioritizing what dependencies should be refactored next.\n\n2022-W06 (Feb 11)\n\n👥 Team and People Updates\n\n                                                                                                                              * The engineer on-call next week is Vini.\n\n                                                                                                                              * On Wednesday, we had our Q4/21 QQR (slides).

After some investigation, we found that the problem was introduced on Thursday evening with some changes to the authentication library in frontend infra. The issue was fixed on Monday noon, and after that we had to manually fix the data of ~250 customers that had a weekly subscription due to this issue. There will be two post-mortems written, one by Frontend Infra and one by Vini’s team.\n\n💻 Tech Initiatives\n\n                                                                                                                              * Visual Testing Initiative:\n\n                                                                                                                              * This week we completed honeycomb integration for traces dashboard and alerting for all WL UI Tests.\n\n                                                                                                                              * We also completed the vault integration and cleaned up old credentials code working with the docker image on the live UI Tests\n\n                                                                                                                              * HoneyComb Dashboard\n\n                                                                                                                              * Visual Testing Slack Channel Alert : #alerts-new-brands-visual-tests\n\n2022-W04 (Jan 28)\n\n👥 Team and People Updates\n\n                                                                                                                              * The engineer on-call next week is Ahmed.\n\n                                                                                                                              * Suzi is on vacation and will be back on Feb 8th\n\n\n\n\n\n🥩🎁 Good Chop x Engagement \n\n                                                                                                                              * The team just launched the L Box take rate experiment, which consists of a couple of changes in our Plans page to improve our experience and emphasize the benefits of our biggest plan\n\n                                                                                                                              * The team started the first non Good Chop specific work in the squad, which is implementing a freebie slider for GreenChef instead of using our current pop up.

Most of our tech initiatives from Q3/2021 are completed (kudos for everyone!). We still need to focus on measuring the success of some (e.g. Visual testing, E2E test improvement) and decided if the underlying issues were addressed. Overall we see increased code ownership and decisiveness about technical real estate since, which is great! \n\n                                                                                                                              * Fab4+ metrics exist now on Squad Level. Unfortunately, a tableau license is needed. Since we pay for Tableau per user, it doesn’t scale that everyone has a license just for obtaining Fab4+ metrics. For now, please discuss the Fab4+ metrics with your Squad Lead.\n\n                                                                                                                              * The ​​Data Access in the Server Side RFC is finally complete, and the proposed solution has been implemented as a proof of        concept. Last week the background-data-refreshing was first used for HF Applanga translations, and after a few days without problems we rolled it out for RCS and Optimizely datafile. This morning during Chapter Day we had a session to explain how this solution works, and implemented it for Presets, Products and Contentful (whitelabel only). We expect to see an increase of service availability (less alerts) and a decrease in latency during off-hours (when people are mostly asleep, and cache hit ratio is normally down).\n\n                                                                                                                              * The Enhance e2e tests initiative has been marked as complete after a lot of hard work (shoutout to Max and Bolo for leading it!). The last milestone was to write a document explaining our QA Strategy and how we do E2E testing with Cypress.

We still have the whitelabel-web repo because there are a couple of concourse jobs in there that are still being used by us.\n\n                                                                                                                              * Unbind dependencies: one big issue we started having after migrating to frontend infra is that our code had a lot of bad internal dependencies. This was causing some circular dependencies between packages, and it was slowing down the CI by running E2E tests that were not really needed. After extracting code to new libraries and removing some problematic import-export root files (icons, common components, store) we consider this initiative done. I will be sharing more info on this topic once we are all back in January.\n\n\n\n\n\n2021-W50 (December 17th, 2021)\n\n👥 Team and People Updates\n\n                                                                                                                              * The engineer on-call next week is A-DOS\n\n                                                                                                                              * Since starting next week a lot of people will be on vacation, remember you can always check who is in and who is out in this spreadsheet.\n\n🎁 Engagement\n\n                                                                                                                              * This week, we’ve been focused on addressing bugs for release our Managed Week 1.0 on Web (Skip Delivery and Change Box Size)\n\n                                                                                                                              * We have already wrapped up a cross-tribe collaboration to improve our Referral emails.\n\n                                                                                                                              * From now we use the same BE services to validate and send invites for Freebies and EveryShare\n\n                                                                                                                              * Kudos to Virality and CRM teams\n\n🥩 Good Chop\n\n                                                                                                                              *  We are still working on our “save meals selection for future deliveries” feature. \n\n🛒 M&M\n\n                                                                                                                              * This week we are still working on the meal choice experience survey as our sprint goal\n\n                                                                                                                              * The premium recipes price test that we did on CK was recently completed and it had interesting results. Surcharge revenue (main metric for the test) increased for the variation where we increased $1 per serving, but further investigation showed that add-ons revenue and seamless revenue increased for the variation where we decreased $1 per serving, so they cancel each other out in the end.. As a next step we are awaiting feedback from Chefs Plate, as which version to roll out is highly depending on the local team’s strategy (i.e. whether to push for premium recipes or add-ons & seamless).\n\n💻 Tech Initiatives\n\n                                                                                                                              * Next Monday we will do a force update of the Factor mobile app, and start the process of killing whitelabel-web 🔥\n\n2021-W49 (December 10th, 2021)\n\n👥 Team and People Updates\n\n                                                                                                                              * The engineer on-call next week is Diljohn\n\n                                                                                                                              * Please remember to send your baby photo to Jess for our next Coffee Chat!\n\n                                                                                                                              * We created a spreadsheet to track who will be on vacation during the Christmas season.

Even though the issue fixed itself after a few minutes, we still need to work on improving our resiliency on different levels: fallback RCS data when API is down (or any other type of data used by server), and improving CDN caching to return stale HTML pages when the service is down (currently implemented in most of our pages, but we still miss a couple of important ones). Here’s the link to the incident’s post mortem.\n\n💻 Tech Initiatives\n\n                                                                                                                              * This week we made good progress towards killing the legacy whitelabel-web service. The Engagement team removed all API calls to the second-voucher endpoint and M&M migrated the `/recipe-rating` endpoint to NextJS (kudos to Suzi, Guhan, Mateusz and Max for this complex migration!).\n\n2021-W47 (November 25th, 2021)\n\n👥 Team and People Updates\n\n                                                                                                                              * The engineer on-call next week is Fede\n\n                                                                                                                              * Tribe OKRs are on the way and a draft to be submitted by the end of today.

Next step is to launch the experiment next sprint on EP US, where we test the new view mode (w/o add-ons carousel) against the single menu screen (SMS)\n\n💻 Tech Initiatives\n\nAlex and I worked together to build a HoneyComb business metrics dashboard: https://ui.honeycomb.io/hellofresh/board/hg5aFAPfC91/WL-Business-Metrics - Right now it only shows stats about meal swaps done on the whitelabel clients (mobile and app), but the idea is to keep adding more info to it, and eventually create SLOs\n\n\n\n\n\n2021-W45 (November 12th, 2021)\n\n👥 Team and People Updates\n\n                                                                                                                              * Today is Solenne’s last day in HelloFresh - after more than 3 years working here, building EveryPlate from ground up and then leading New Brands Retention, she is out for new challenges in Paris.

This is part of a bigger initiative to untangle the dependency between our packages. As part of this initiative, we also found some unused legacy code from our old routing system that was causing all whitelabel pages to indirectly depend on the rest of the pages. By removing this code, a change on a single page should only trigger the cypress tests on that page only, instead of running all our tests.\n\n                                                                                                                              * After A-DOS worked on removing some 3rd party dependencies in our react-native app and converted the distributable file(s) from APK to AAB, he wrote a nice post in our HelloTech engineering blog.\n\n________________\n\n2021-W37 (September 17th, 2021)\n\n👥 Team and People Updates\n\n                                                                                                                              * Desi will be the on-call engineer next week\n\n                                                                                                                              * Fede is moving to Spain tomorrow and will be on vacation for the next two weeks, coming back on October 1st\n\n                                                                                                                              * Jess is on vacation, returning Tuesday Sep 28th. \n\n🥩 Good Chop\n\n                                                                                                                              * We made some improvements to the pre-checkout cuts selection experience on mobile and managed to gain back ⅓ of the screen space when no offer discount banners are displayed.

Every NextJS page component can define a list of endpoints that should be fetched, so the page can use the returned data to render the HTML. Every one of our pages need contentful data, products, preferences, optimizely datafile and RCS. The problem we had was that when going from one page to another, NextJS was fetching all this data over and over again making the page transition very slow. Yesterday we were able to merge a proof of concept fix, and this morning we released the fix to all whitelabel pages in web infra.\n\n                                                                                                                              * Now that there are no outstanding issues that can block the migration, we will start testing our New Brands in the web infra. Of course we need to verify that all user flows are working as expected, but since our TestCafe tests are all passing against the web infra, we will need to pay extra attention to infrastructure topics that are not covered by our e2e tests. I created a list with these points, feel free to add anything that I might have missed. https://hellofresh.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SC/pages/2936569923/Testing+Plan\n\n                                                                                                                              * The first version of HelloDev was released by Platform.

Interviews start next week.\n\n                                                                                                                              * Last Friday we had a team event where most of the team in Berlin went on a 4-hour boat trip around the city 🍻\n\n  \n\n\n\n🥩 Good Chop\n\n                                                                                                                              * The team has been focusing on implementing the first batch on E2E tests\n\n                                                                                                                              * There was one case of not being able to subscribe a customer to endless pause due to subscription not being created yet, which was caught thanks to our alerts! Vini investigated and it turns out we were not relying on the right source to know if a subscription had been created.\n\n                                                                                                                              * Currently, the funnel is not performing well. This is likely due to a mix of several reasons, such as lack of online presence of the brand, lack of social proof, unclarity of customers around what they get. Val is currently analysing the results of 10 unmoderated user interviews focused on the funnel and the first logged-in experience, which will give us  more insights on how we can improve it. \n\n\n\n\n\n🎁 Loyalty Challenge\n\n                                                                                                                              * This week, we have continued to work on the later flows of Loyalty.\n\n                                                                                                                              * In tandem, we are also improving how we are presenting voucher communication on the App to ensure users understand how additional vouchers work. \n\n\n\n\n\n🛒 M&M\n\n                                                                                                                              * We teamed up with Toronto to launch preferences for ER and the A/B test is finally live!

The new dashboard experience should help us scale beyond the single menu screen and cater for many more use cases, such as adding an entry point for add-ons.\n\n💻 Tech Initiatives\n\n                                                                                                                              * This week we finished the Optimizely setup in the Web Infra. We are now working on improving our CDN caching rules to reduce the traffic we receive in our nodejs service. Next week after proper caching is implemented we will start testing the web infra and start rolling out some countries in the new infra.\n\n                                                                                                                              * I did a presentation in this morning’s chapter day explaining some basic caching concepts and how the CDN works.

We first stopped fetching customer+subscription data from the server, and since this morning we are no longer rendering different experiment variations on the server side. This only affects how we implement logged-out users experiments, since for logged-in users we never had server-side experimentation. The only logged-out user experiment that could be affected has been (Plans page in Factor, not launched yet) refactored to minimize the impact of this architecture change.\n\n________________\n\n2021-W27 (July 9nd, 2021)\n\n👥 Team and People Updates\n\n                                                                                                                              * Max is back from vacation next monday\n\n                                                                                                                              * Ahmed is going to be the on-call engineer next week\n\n                                                                                                                              * This week we had the Quarterly Quality Review of Q2, where we showed to Yoav, Monasin and Davor how we performed last quarter and what we are going to do next in Q3.

Because of this, we decided to merge back the BFF changes to master.\n\n                                                                                                                                    * Most of the access control functions have been migrated.

We will regroup with the design team on Monday to decide on how to adjust the dashboard \n\n                                                                                                                                    * Roland and Amanda are working on the theming and the funnel. \n\n                                                                                                                                    * Last but not least, the brand name will be chosen next week !! \n\n🏅 Mid-Year FOODIE Cycle\n\n                                                                                                                                    * This week, emails were sent out to participants in the mid-year FOODIE cycle. In case you are a provider of feedback or you are participating, plan in sufficient time and space.\n\n💻 Tech Initiatives\n\n                                                                                                                                    * Due to big performance issues, we had to revert the BFF changes on the mobile app. We will start investigating and discussing different options on how to fix these problems so we can resume with the BFF migration.\n\n                                                                                                                                    * We are halfway done with the Access Control migration and should be done with it by the end of next week.\n\n                                                                                                                                    * Pep made a lot of progress on the web (infra) repo, and already has a few funnel pages working, including brand theming. Yesterday he gave a presentation of what he achieved and how. Here’s a document he wrote on how does the web<->whitelabel-web integration works: https://github.com/hellofresh/web/blob/master/app/spaces/whitelabel/README.md\n\n\n\n\n\n🏆 Loyalty Challenge\n\nWe started with the implementation of the Loyalty Challenge on our mobile app. We already have the navigation item and the bare-bones screen, enabled only in ER staging. We are now implementing a component that will show in the Home Feed, that will prompt the user to go to the Challenge screen.\n\n________________\n\n2021-W14 (April 9th, 2021)\n\n👥 Team and People Updates\n\n                                                                                                                                    * Next week we will have two new joiners! Arbaaz joins the Engagement team as a frontend engineer, and Suzanna will join us as a frontend intern. Please give them a warm welcome and support their onboarding as much as you can.\n\n                                                                                                                                    * Some of us joined the mob programming workshop with Woody Zuill.\n\n💻 Tech Initiatives\n\n                                                                                                                                    * The BFF migration in the mobile app is almost almost almost almost complete. Yesterday a big PR in whitelabel-web was merged, doing a massive cleanup of the legacy menu code.\n\n                                                                                                                                    * This week we migrated the access control function of the Refer a Friend page, and we are currently working on migrating the Cancellation and Delivery Tracking page.\n\n💸 Additional Vouchers\n\nWe are still working on fixing the price calculation of surcharge discounts for future weeks (next modifiable week works well) on web, and then we will replicate the changes on mobile.\n\n🚀 PorterHouse\n\nNext sprint, the development work for PorterHouse will kick off with Vini and Diljohn joining the PorterHouse Tiger team. A proof of concept for monthly delivery was shared.\n\nThe user research for the PorterHouse logged in area is also kicked off (see video attached). \n\nNext week we will have some meetings with the HelloFresh teams to clarify the implementation of the monthly delivery and the physical incentives for vouchers. \n\n________________\n\n2021-W13\n\n🛣️ Q2+Q3 Roadmap\n\nSolenne, Ahmed, Tobias and I sat down and put our planned projects into a roadmap for Q2 and Q3. Tobias and Solenne presented this roadmap to Yoav and Annie and received good feedback about it. In the second tab of the spreadsheet we listed the priorities, with Porterhouse leading the list. Whenever we have to make a hard choice between two deliveries, we will decide for the one with the higher priority. That makes projects with lower priority more likely to be delayed than the ones with higher priority. If you have any concern of a high-priority project, please let Tobias and Solenne know as soon as possible.\n\n💻 Tech Initiatives\n\n                                                                                                                                    * The BFF migration in the mobile app is almost almost almost complete. We can expect the initiative to be complete early next week. There are still some cleaning up to do on web and mobile.\n\n                                                                                                                                    * Last week we implemented a proof of concept of how we can migrate route access control to react components, and this we started with the migration of the access control function for the Cancellation page. By the end of next week, we should have also migrated the Delivery Tracking and RaF routes.\n\n💸 Additional Vouchers\n\nOne of Engagement's sprint goals is to support Additional Vouchers in our price calculation logic for web and mobile. This week we started working on the website, refactoring the voucher Redux logic (🍝) and implementing the action to fetch a subscription's additional voucher info.\n\n🔪 Killing Alice\n\nThis week we removed the last API call to Alice: update payment method in web. Before Alice is really killed in Intfood (expected mid April), we will need to do a force update of our mobile app to prevent users from using old versions that are still using the old endpoints.\n\n🛒 Add-ons\n\nThe Happiness team started to implement some changes for Add-Ons, and was able to setup some add-ons SKUs in staging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n—\n\nPrevious Notes Location: https://www.notion.so/New-Brands-Retention-Weekly-Notes-c227bcddd153472f841114c2603de18d",
