Someone in Cobbler Hill (United States-NYCHQ, 7) plans to prepare the necessary work to merge the required configuration setting into the live environment today and will ask someone from the town team to review the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\nNotes Length: Standard\n\n* Voucher Application and Plan Removal Issue Someone in Cobbler Hill (United States-NYCHQ, 7) observed a problem where a voucher was consistently applied, even after attempting to clear it, and found that the plan menu disappeared after clicking on a \"one time box\" option. They noted that the price was initially zero despite a voucher being present, and they also saw the voucher value of minus 50. Someone in Cobbler Hill (United States-NYCHQ, 7) highlighted that on staging, unlike in the current environment, the plans would typically remain available after selecting a one-time box, allowing for the voucher to be removed.\n\n* Menu and Allocation Configuration Discrepancies Someone in Cobbler Hill (United States-NYCHQ, 7) noticed that the system was recognizing a W52 menu, but the menu still showed 'classic box free cut' instead of a GPU-specific one, indicating a potential issue with menu request or allocation. They explored whether the problem was related to CCM or a syncing issue, confirming that menus set up on live sync to staging the next day. Someone in Cobbler Hill (United States-NYCHQ, 7) then found a configuration difference: a necessary setting was present on staging but missing on live.\n\n* Resolution Plan for Missing Configuration Someone in Cobbler Hill (United States-NYCHQ, 7) confirmed the need to merge something inside the code to resolve the configuration issue. They agreed to prepare the necessary work today to merge the required configuration setting into the live environment. Someone in Cobbler Hill (United States-NYCHQ, 7) decided to ask someone from the town team to review the issue and confirmed they would leave the matter with them.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested next steps\n\nNo suggested next steps were found for this meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should review Gemini's notes to make sure they're accurate.

      "content": "﻿📝 Notes\n\nDec 18, 2025\n\nInfluencer MP: EOY Review\n\nInvited Ian Brooks Melanie Schwindt Katheryn Eckles Wanderley Teixeira Annette MvdE Sameer Doda Shay Obaidullah Alison McMenemy Marc Alice Canty Guido Mancassola Nikita Gorshkov Marlene Rosner Cole Banning Marina Kramer Jama Musse Linnea Siersma\n\nAttachments Influencer MP: EOY Review \n\nMeeting records Transcript File \n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nAnnette MvdE welcomed the team, including Katheryn Eckles, Sameer Doda, Nikita Gorshkov, and Marc, to review last year's research and plan for next year, focusing on ongoing customer and creator interviews. Katheryn Eckles shared that influencer interviews revealed positive creator interest, but strong demand for clear monetization structure, efficient low-effort recipe uploads (e.g., automated nutrition facts), and enhanced filtering options on creator profiles, with concerns raised about the potential cost and time impact of the vetting process. Customer interviews showed high enthusiasm for the marketplace concept and a preference for low-commitment purchase models, emphasizing the need for creator trust established through verified badges, transparent reviews, and links to original social media videos. Someone in Megan Thee Scallion (Canada - Toronto HQ, 2) proposed integrating vetted creator recipes into HelloFresh's active meal selection for existing subscribers, suggesting that creators be paid every time their recipe ships, while Sameer Doda provided updates on scoping the MVP for the one-time purchase experience, leading to a recognized challenge regarding the sequencing of customer-facing versus creator-facing capabilities due to the supply-driven nature of the platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\nNotes Length: Standard\n\n* Last Year's Review and Early Insights Annette MvdE welcomed the team to the last year's review and thanked them for joining. The main focus of the sprint was customer interviews and concept evaluation with creators, which are still ongoing, with seven participants for the concept evaluation and the last session scheduled for Friday. Annette MvdE outlined the agenda, including Katheryn Eckles sharing research findings, updates from Melanie or Sameer, and a discussion on recommendations and plans for the next year (00:00:00).\n\n* Creator Research Findings Overview Katheryn Eckles reported that they are one interview away from completing all influencer interviews, totaling 12, which is more than expected due to successful recruitment (00:01:29). Initial common findings show that influencers view the concept positively and see high potential value in addressing ingredient sourcing friction for their audiences, provided there is operational efficiency and a clear return on investment (ROI). Creators are especially interested in the monetization structure and reducing the effort needed to upload and maintain content on the platform (00:02:39).\n\n* Creator Profile and Recipe Modularity Insights Regarding the creator profile screen, Katheryn Eckles noted that influencers strongly desired more filtering and tagging options, particularly for dietary needs like dairy-free and gluten-free, beyond the few category tags shown. Annette MvdE suggested that the platform could encourage creators to easily modify their recipes to accommodate swaps for a wider audience, possibly leveraging existing HelloFresh features like meat kit swapping (00:04:43).

Katheryn Eckles shared that influencer interviews revealed positive creator interest, but strong demand for clear monetization structure, efficient low-effort recipe uploads (e.g., automated nutrition facts), and enhanced filtering options on creator profiles, with concerns raised about the potential cost and time impact of the vetting process. Customer interviews showed high enthusiasm for the marketplace concept and a preference for low-commitment purchase models, emphasizing the need for creator trust established through verified badges, transparent reviews, and links to original social media videos. Someone in Megan Thee Scallion (Canada - Toronto HQ, 2) proposed integrating vetted creator recipes into HelloFresh's active meal selection for existing subscribers, suggesting that creators be paid every time their recipe ships, while Sameer Doda provided updates on scoping the MVP for the one-time purchase experience, leading to a recognized challenge regarding the sequencing of customer-facing versus creator-facing capabilities due to the supply-driven nature of the platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\nNotes Length: Standard\n\n* Last Year's Review and Early Insights Annette MvdE welcomed the team to the last year's review and thanked them for joining. The main focus of the sprint was customer interviews and concept evaluation with creators, which are still ongoing, with seven participants for the concept evaluation and the last session scheduled for Friday. Annette MvdE outlined the agenda, including Katheryn Eckles sharing research findings, updates from Melanie or Sameer, and a discussion on recommendations and plans for the next year (00:00:00).\n\n* Creator Research Findings Overview Katheryn Eckles reported that they are one interview away from completing all influencer interviews, totaling 12, which is more than expected due to successful recruitment (00:01:29). Initial common findings show that influencers view the concept positively and see high potential value in addressing ingredient sourcing friction for their audiences, provided there is operational efficiency and a clear return on investment (ROI). Creators are especially interested in the monetization structure and reducing the effort needed to upload and maintain content on the platform (00:02:39).\n\n* Creator Profile and Recipe Modularity Insights Regarding the creator profile screen, Katheryn Eckles noted that influencers strongly desired more filtering and tagging options, particularly for dietary needs like dairy-free and gluten-free, beyond the few category tags shown. Annette MvdE suggested that the platform could encourage creators to easily modify their recipes to accommodate swaps for a wider audience, possibly leveraging existing HelloFresh features like meat kit swapping (00:04:43). Katheryn Eckles confirmed that this modularity piece had come up in a few interviews (00:06:03).\n\n* Creator Landing Page and Action Clarity The creator landing page was found to be informative, but creators we\n\n\n\neeing I would argue pretty strong initial signs of potential product market fit both in both directions in this marketplace.\n\nAnnette MvdE: Right.\n\nSameer Doda: set up follow-up conversations on that uh for us and yeah\n\nAnnette MvdE: Um\n\n \n\n \n\n00:54:32\n\n \n\nSameer Doda: like Nikita said I mean we already we're not waiting for uh that right now in any case we are already going ahead with at least one side of the platform so it's not uh kind of reducing our speed to delivery in any way shape or form uh but of course once we get to that decision it will also help us make uh decisions on the creator side of things uh more quickly\n\nMegan Thee Scallion (Canada - Toronto HQ, 2): Yeah.

Participants Alexander Matlin, Nikita Gorshkov, Edwin Torres, and Morteza Pourkazemi discussed that while functional testing was successful on staging, the Katana and Salesforce events needed live testing, and they theorized the lack of triggered events might be due to a business division issue requiring the `grow go kit` library or a configuration problem like \"factor market\" not being enabled, as the orchestrator \"ops\" likely emits these events. The team agreed that the refund payment issue, which Edwin Torres noted requires an update to the `grow go kit` library to properly handle the new business division, can be deferred to week two, while Alexander Matlin will contact Marat and Arem from the plans squad regarding the event production issues, escalating to an incident if no response is received by 12 PM Berlin time the following day, and Nikita Gorshkov asked Hamed Karimian to investigate a manual refund process in the interim.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\nNotes Length: Standard\n\n* VMS Launch Blockers for OTP Hamed Karimian introduced the main goal of the meeting: to resolve outstanding issues for the OTP launch for VMS, with the hope of going live next week. The identified blockers include not receiving events in Katana, Salesforce not receiving OTP events, and an error during refund payments on OTP. Nikita Gorshkov suggested that the refund payment issue could be resolved in week two, prioritizing the first two issues as R\\&D blockers for launch.\n\n* Testing Environment and Live Issues Alexander Matlin asked if the issues were consistently present since the internal-only live launch, which Hamed Karimian confirmed, noting that the two first orders on live, made by internal users, immediately exhibited these problems (00:01:10). Edwin Torres explained that while functional tests, error handling, and other cases worked on staging, they lacked the ability to test the Katana and Salesforce parts in staging, necessitating testing on live with specific customers (00:02:13). Morteza Pourkazemi stated that testing for TCS (Salesforce side) and Katana is possible on staging, suggesting that for Salesforce, ensuring the email has the underlying test suffix should allow testing (00:03:46).\n\n* Missing Events to Katana and Salesforce Edwin Torres confirmed that orders were created successfully and visible in \"all\" or Bob, but communications to Katana and Salesforce events were not triggered (00:06:26). Edwin Torres theorized that the lack of triggered events, which means the customer would not receive the physical product, might be related to the business division and the required use of the `grow go kit` library (00:07:36). Alexander Matlin and Nikita Gorshkov discussed that the problem might be a configuration issue since the same API points are used by other brands, suggesting that the \"factor market\" might not be enabled (00:08:51).\n\n* Identifying Event Emitters and Next Steps for Blockers Edwin Torres initially thought the events were generated by Customer Order Services, but after reviewing a diagram, concluded that \"ops,\n\n\n\no be seeing at the moment, uh my ask to you Hammed, would be how can we figure out a refund process that would be manual like uh uh with the team throughout uh next week so that if a refund is requested, we can trigger some kind of refunds one way or the other manually extracting this particular order number, what have you.\n\nHamed Karimian: Yeah, I'm sure there should there should be a way for that.\n\nEdwin Torres: Yeah.\n\nHamed Karimian: I I can reach out to the customer care team to see if\n\nNikita Gorshkov: And in the meantime, uh, let's, uh, Edwin, can you, you already have the ticket,\n\nHamed Karimian: there's\n\nNikita Gorshkov: right?\n\nEdwin Torres: Yeah, I have the ticket.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Do you have a thread within their channel on the I guess it's on the payment side.

So it's the third the third point.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Oh, it's with Yeah, it's where Gang go. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.\n\nEdwin Torres: Yeah.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Okay.\n\nEdwin Torres: Oh yeah.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: All right.\n\nEdwin Torres: Yeah.

They agreed on the need to define the smallest possible product and to test ideas by understanding pet owners' top worries through a survey, which Nikita Gorshkov confirmed the commercial team can easily incorporate into existing surveys. Prateek Jajoo inquired about the power user demographics, whom Nikita Gorshkov identified as \"dinks\" in metro areas, with high annual spending on their pets.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\nNotes Length: Standard\n\n* Content Strategy and App Development Nikita Gorshkov noted the company's weak history in content strategies and daily active user increases, which makes them cautious about investing heavily in content, despite recognizing the interest. They suggested finding easy ways to show users that their products improve pet health, which can then be used as social proof on the website. Prateek Jajoo connected this idea to the potential basis for a pet app, which Nikita Gorshkov affirmed could be a strong idea.\n\n* Testing Ideas and Customer Concerns Nikita Gorshkov emphasized the need to define the smallest possible product and, more importantly, to test interesting ideas to build confidence before committing significant resources. Prateek Jajoo suggested understanding the top five worries or thoughts a pet owner has about their pet to ensure that any app features or solutions address what customers truly care about, thus driving daily usage and engagement. Nikita Gorshkov agreed that providing basic tracking capabilities should be offered not only to active customers but potentially to any pet owners who download the app.\n\n* Surveying Pet Owners To understand customer thoughts, Prateek Jajoo suggested running a survey. Nikita Gorshkov confirmed that the commercial team already runs a survey every two weeks or monthly, and it would be easy to add additional questions due to a good response rate. They shared the contact of Lindsay within the TPT team, who typically runs these in-depth surveys, and offered to add Prateek Jajoo for visibility, mentioning that the latest one they had access to was from August.\n\n* Target Customer Demographics and Spending Prateek Jajoo inquired about the demographics of the power user customer. Nikita Gorshkov identified the power users as \"dinks\" (Dual Income, No Kids) in metro areas, who have the time, energy, and desire to pamper their pets with fresh frozen food, considering the increase in dog ownership and the perception of pets as children. Nikita Gorshkov noted that the average spend in the US per dog is $1.6k per year, emphasizing that this is a lot of money and the highest amount globally.\n\n* Customer Connection and Health Measurement Prateek Jajoo discussed the emotional attachment and time spent with a dog, suggesting owners would notice improvements in health or appearance, but proposed that the company should help measure and communicate those improvements rather than waiting for the customer to figure it out. Nikita Gorshkov agreed with the sentiment and suggested that Prateek Jajoo speak with Yara, who owns a dog named Boba and represents a good middle ground for their target audience, as she ensures their pet is healthy and happy. Prateek Jajoo connected this idea of measuring and communicating health improvements to solving the retention problem, comparing it to the high utility of services like Amazon Prime.\n\n* Next Steps and Design Bandwidth Prateek Jajoo stated that they would start working on the login page and write a one-pager for review to plan stage one and stage two for a quick win within one sprint. Prateek Jajoo expressed concern about Katrina's bandwidth for the design work. Nikita Gorshkov confirmed they are working to ensure Katrina has the necessary bandwidth and is pushing back on distractions from their senior director.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested next steps\n\n* Prateek Jajoo will start work on the login page and write a one-pager to review and make stage one and stage two plans for a quick win within one sprint.\n\n* Nikita Gorshkov will help Prateek Jajoo navigate where to find the survey and related information by sending the contact for Lindsay and adding Prateek Jajoo to the TPT team for visibility on the surveys.\n\n* Prateek Jajoo will work with the designer Katrina to ensure the right questions are being asked in the survey to get the right information.\n\n* Nikita Gorshkov will ensure that Katrina has the bandwidth for the design work.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should review Gemini's notes to make sure they're accurate.
