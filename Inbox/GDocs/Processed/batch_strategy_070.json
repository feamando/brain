For CR, we successfully launched the Reactivation page revamp and are on progress to launch the One Time Purchase experiment. On the AOR side, we drove Free Add-on take rates to over 90% consistently by closing gaps in the selection and persistence experience, and launched Charge at Checkout.\n\n1. Reactivation Page Revamp. We launched a new, mobile-first reactivation page that reduces the page length by one third with improvements on information architecture and clearer call to action. Also, customers can now choose their free add-ons directly on the reactivation page, instead of after reactivating their accounts. These changes are foundational to run more free for life reactivation campaigns including turkeys on Thanksgiving  (+20% CR YoY). However, some critical features were de-prioritized such as the ability to change cadence and reschedule directly on the reactivation page. \n\n2. One-Time Purchases (OTP). The technical solution for OTP pivoted from the initial MVP hack to the proper solution due to a technical blocker from CRM as well as higher confidence in the new endpoint following HF rollouts. While this solution saves time in the long-term, the launch week is delayed (likely W2’2026 - TBC) due to additional time for another technical investigation and (unplanned) capacity constraints.\n\n3. Closing Free Add-on Take Rate. By October we finally reached +90% free add-on take rate for both new and active users consistently. Persisting free add-ons (+40% active TR), developing the multi-add-on pop-up on funnel and reactivation (+5% TR), and migrating bundle offers to Wallet (4.2k customers). While it’s great that we finally closed down the Wallet take rate gap, a significant portion of Q3 engineering capacity was allocated, which was not originally accounted for in the H2 roadmap.\n\n4. Charge at Checkout. By charging customers at checkout instead of at cut-off, we aim to improve empty conversions and acceptance rates, thereby positively impacting overall delivered orders.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearnings: \n\n* Better resource planning for adhoc and technical initiatives needed: We only executed on 2 out of 5 key strategies referenced in the previous strategy document with projects such as the Pricing Value Experiment getting pushed to next year. When planning for H2 2025, we did not initially account for initiatives such as Subscribable free add ons, as well as more tactical initiatives like 2-week cadence or legal compliance initiatives in the (cancellation) funnel. Engineering capacity was also impacted around September-October due to personnel changes, including one transfer to TPT and two individuals taking parental leave. We also need to proactively account for resourcing technical initiatives such as endpoint deprecations and migrations.\n\n* More space needed for iterations: there are initiatives such as Seamless and Search with clear next iterations, however instead of building these we focused on building new initiatives.

      "content": "﻿The Pets Table App v1: Notifications-First MVP\n\nDate: 2025-12-11 Authors: Prateek Jajoo (PM), Nikita Gorshkov (Dir Product) Status: Proposal\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Purpose\n\nThe Pets Table (TPT) faces a critical retention challenge: our Average Order Rate (AOR) lags behind competitors like Farmer’s Dog and Ollie, largely due to the lack of proactive, mobile-first customer engagement. This proposal outlines a low-cost, high-velocity strategy to deploy a TPT native mobile app. By leveraging a \"webview-first\" architecture (React Native shell + existing web flows), we can bypass expensive native development to deliver v0 (Web Parity) and v1 (Push Notifications). The core value prop isn't the app interface itself, but the notification channel it unlocks—driving customers back to the service for order management and upsells, projected to generate ~$1.5M in annualized incremental revenue.\n\n2. Current State / Problem\n\n\"Out of sight, out of mind.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n* Lagging AOR: TPT’s AOR is trailing key competitors who utilize native apps to maintain persistent screen real estate and habituation.\n\n* Reactive vs. Proactive: Our current web-only experience relies on customers remembering to visit our site or opening emails (20-25% open rate). We lack a direct, proactive trigger to prompt timely order management.\n\n* Friction: Logging into a mobile website is high-friction compared to biometric app login, discouraging frequent \"snacking\" interactions where add-on upsells occur.\n\n3. Strategic Solution\n\nBuild \"The Notification Vehicle\" Instead of a costly, multi-quarter native app build, we propose a Webview-First Hybrid App.\n\n\n\n\n\n* Strategy: Use the Client Platform’s new React Native infrastructure to wrap our existing mobile web experience.\n\n* Philosophy: \"The app is a notification delivery vehicle with a dashboard face. Everything else is a webview.\"\n\n* Cost/Speed: Minimizes engineering effort by reusing 90% of existing web code. Focuses native development strictly on the \"Unlock\" features: Push Notifications and Biometric Login.\n\nCore Experiences: v0 vs v1\n\nFeature\n\n\tv0 Scope (POC)\n\n\tv1 Scope (The Unlock)\n\n\tGoal\n\n\tParity & Presence\n\n\tEngagement & Revenue\n\n\tCore UI\n\n\tFull Webview Wrapper (Pixel-perfect recreation of mobile web)\n\n\tWebview + Native Navigation Shell\n\n\tAuthentication\n\n\tPersistent Web Session (Cookie-based)\n\n\tPersistent Web Session (Cookie-based)\n\n\tNotifications\n\n\tNone\n\n\tRich Push Notifications (Transactional + Marketing)\n\n\tDashboard\n\n\tWeb View\n\n\tNative \"Glanceable\" Dashboard (Next Box Date, Status)\n\n\tOrder Mgmt\n\n\tWeb View\n\n\tWeb View (Deep-linked from Notifications)\n\n\tUpsell\n\n\tStandard Web Flow\n\n\tPush-Triggered Upsell (e.g., \"Add treats to box shipping tomorrow\")\n\n\t\n\n\n\nDetailed scope sheet: Google Sheet Link\n\n4. Business Impact\n\nHypothesis: Notifications drive frequency; frequency drives AOR and AOV.\n\nBenchmarks (Weekly TPT Updates)\n\n* Current AOR: Lagging behind key competitors (Farmer's Dog, Ollie).\n\n* Competitor Engagement: Apps drive ~2x session frequency vs. mobile web.\n\n* Push Open Rates: 5-10x higher than Email.\n\nProjected Lift (Annualized)\n\nLever\n\n\tMechanism\n\n\tConservative Impact\n\n\tRevenue Impact\n\n\tOrder Recovery\n\n\t\"Last chance to edit\" & \"Card failure\" pushes\n\n\t+5% AOR (App Users)\n\n\t~$1.1M\n\n\tAdd-on Upsell\n\n\t\"New treat\" & \"Box shipping soon\" pushes\n\n\t+$2 AOV (App Users)\n\n\t~$400K\n\n\tTotal\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t~$1.5M\n\n\t\n\n\n\nAssumptions: ~50k Active Subs, 30% App Adoption, $80 Base AOV.\n\n5. Technical Strategy\n\nWe will leverage the new HelloFresh Client Platform capabilities to avoid building from scratch.\n\n\n\n\n\n* Shell: React Native \"Container\" provided by Client Platform.\n\n* Bridge: Two-way communication between Native Shell and Webview (allowing the web page to trigger native push permission prompts).\n\n* Notifications: Integrated with ABBA (HelloFresh's notification infrastructure) and Braze/CRM for campaign management.\n\n* Documentation: Infrastructure Architecture\n\n6. Recommendations\n\n1. Proceed with v0/v1 Strategy: Prioritize the notification unlock over native feature parity to maximize speed to value.\n\n2. Leverage Client Platform: Utilize the existing React Native shell infrastructure to minimize overhead.\n\n3. Launch & Learn: Ship v1 to validate the +5% AOR hypothesis before investing in further native features (v2).\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n* TPT App 2026 - NV <> Client Platform Sync\n\n* 2026 HFG Domain Objectives - The Pets Table\n\n* TPT Weekly Check-in Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomatically generated by Gemini on 2025-12-11",

Updating existing core native iOS/Android modules to support RTE and related functionality \n\n2. Migrate existing React Native experiences to the Shared Modules cross-platform solution and extend functionality\n\n\n\n\n\nAccounting for these engineering estimates, market-specific business needs and long-term team ownership, this document looks to propose a technical solution (ie: Extend Native Modules: vs. React Native) for each TRE along with an overall project timeline and resource costing proposal to help drive 2025 Yearly Planning dependency conversations across teams.\n\nContext\n\nIn Q4 2024, Foundations alliance is leading a project to bootstrap the “Shared Modules” repository, which enables teams across HelloTech to create cross-platform mobile experiences via React Native and import them into native mobile apps powered by the existing Swift and Kotlin codebases. Through this Shared Modules solution and infrastructure changes on existing native Swift and Kotlin platforms planned for H1 2025, an “All-brands” mobile app architecture [source] will be available which supports cross-platform development and enables teams to contribute to all HFG brands’ iOS and Android mobile apps.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Swift & Kotlin repos import modules from the “Shared Modules” repo that are then compiled by unified release pipelines to publish native iOS & Android apps across all brands in the organization\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the option of cross-platform mobile development now unlocked across teams in 2025, consumer-facing alliances are now looking to be informed on engineering resources and strategies they should allocate for in their 2025 roadmaps in order to support RTE brands. \n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Project Roadmap\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following project roadmap and timeline was derived from product team roadmaps and engineering effort estimations (see Effort Breakdown) from all impacted alliances.\n\nTimeline\n\nMilestones listed here are further described in the following Milestones section. This timeline might be adjusted as teams re-evaluate effort estimates and align on work stream start dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA detailed view of this overall project roadmap can be found in Miro.\n\nMilestones\n\n\n\n\n\nMilestone\n\n\tTitle\n\n\tSummary\n\n\tOwner\n\n\tETA\n\n\t1 ✅\n\n\tInitial Shared Modules POC completed\n\n\tShip a React Native module (via Shared Modules) as iOS/Android artifacts and import/run them on the existing iOS/Android repos.\n\n\tFoundations/Callstack \n\n\tNov 15, 2024\n\n\t2 ✅\n\n\tInternal Review of POC from external agency\n\n\tFinal review of work delivered by Callstack.
