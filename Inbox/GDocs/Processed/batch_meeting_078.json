Maria Chelminska and Prateek Jajoo outlined TBT 2026's strategy, which includes a growth stream focused on expanding the SKU portfolio, revamping the signup page as a quick win, and a strategic launch of a \"pantry fresh\" product, alongside a retention stream focused on fully digital feeding guides, dashboard improvements, tailored cancellation deflection, and a plan recommendation engine. Someone in Bread Sheeran (Canada - Toronto HQ, 2) and someone in Bread Sheeran (Canada - Toronto HQ, 2) detailed Factor's Q1 roadmap, constrained by the Shopify experiment outcome and new product development complexities, focusing on OTP launch iterations, new product development (mealshake and creatine) despite SKU flexibility issues, and integrating with the Factor app, while Beatrice Dimarucut presented Good Chop's H1 roadmap, prioritizing the OTP launch, a price value experiment to improve conversion/retention, and foundational work to clean up legacy code in the funnel. The participants also discussed integrating third-party tools like Beam for charity donations, Yachtpool for product ratings, and Incom for HelloFresh gift card partnerships.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\nNotes Length: Standard\n\n* Schedule and Meeting Logistics Beatrice Dimarucut set up the meeting to review and align on plans for the next year, aiming to identify overlaps and opportunities to combine courses for development and discovery. Maria Chelminska mentioned that their team's plan is fairly complete for the year, though changes are likely, with Q1 being closer to concrete (00:01:14). The discussion also briefly touched upon workplace conditions, as Maria Chelminska and Prateek Jajoo were meeting in a different building because the heating was broken in the main HelloFresh building in Berlin, which had been a long-term issue (00:00:00).\n\n* TBT 2026 Strategy and Streams Maria Chelminska confirmed that for 2026, the team will operate in two streams: a growth stream and a retention stream. These streams might have separate backlogs, and Maria Chelminska and Prateek Jajoo may focus more on one stream each (00:01:14). The growth stream will follow a setup with a main priority—a larger, strategically important initiative—and quick wins, which are smaller, sprint releases intended to motivate the team and maintain pace (00:02:39).\n\n* Growth Stream Initiatives (Q1) The growth stream will start the year by expanding the SKU portfolio, adding new calorie options for very small and very big dogs. A key initiative is the signup page revamp. Maria Chelminska stated that the current signup page, which uses a shared layout, has not been updated since its launch, and the goal is to improve it as a quick win to increase the intent to proceed by removing messages about add-ons that currently appear to be an upsell (00:02:39).\n\n* Strategic Priority: Pantry Fresh Product Launch A high-priority strategic project is expanding the product offering with a new product type called pantry fresh, which is a fresh product that does not require refrigeration. To prepare for this, the team is redesigning the existing p\n\n\n\nset up uh the integration. I'll keep you folks posted. is fairly straightforward in terms of how it's redeemed. And then we use cash credits that drop onto the HelloFresh accounts uh that the user can redeem in their next box. That's pretty much the the system there. So, if if somebody uh does pick this up, um I I think in at some point once it's live, uh I can see how Yuri and Lauron will get to this topic.\n\n \n\n \n\n01:21:47\n\n \n\nNikita Gorshkov: We can probably just reuse the whole system wholesale.\n\nMaria Chelminska: But a credit for sorry a gift card for HelloFresh can be also used for only used for HelloFresh.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Yes.\n\nAlison Ryan: Those\n\nNikita Gorshkov: But uh just imagine like you probably saw these same as the Xbox cards, the Amazon cards that you see in stores.\n\nBeatrice Dimarucut: physical.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Yeah.\n\nBeatrice Dimarucut: Mhm.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Physical have a fresh group.\n\nMaria Chelminska: Yeah, I was maybe just thinking that it's going to be like a mult multibrand card and we can also benefit from\n\nBeatrice Dimarucut: Nice.\n\nAlison Ryan: are the dreams.

      "content": "﻿📝 Notes\n\nDec 8, 2025\n\nNikita / Beatrice\n\nInvited Nikita Gorshkov Beatrice Dimarucut\n\nAttachments Nikita / Beatrice \n\nMeeting records Transcript \n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nNikita Gorshkov outlined a plan to include a banner suggesting users try the marketplace beta for meat, featuring a one-off box for delivery with express checkout, to be included in the next delivery of dashboards. The team, including Beatrice Dimarucut and Nikita Gorshkov, discussed the technical implementation of one-time purchases (OTP) for active customers, weighing the ease of transferring addresses and choosing between using a proper endpoint or a redirect to Shopify. The main talking points focused on enabling OTP for active customers due to its low cost and potential revenue, which Beatrice Dimarucut agreed to move forward with using minimal UI work and a redirect to a plans page, pending confirmation with Alex.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\nNotes Length: Standard\n\n* Dashboards Delivery and Marketplace Banner Nikita Gorshkov introduced a plan for the next delivery involving dashboards, which would feature a banner suggesting users try the marketplace beta for meat earlier, leading to a full menu. The plan includes a specific banner for customers from a particular URL redirect that offers a one-off box for delivery in two days. Ideally, customer details like the address would transfer at checkout, potentially utilizing Shop Pay for express checkout (00:00:00).\n\n* Technical Implementation for One-Time Purchases (OTP) Beatrice Dimarucut questioned the ease of transferring addresses and raised the choice between directing customers to Shopify or using a proper endpoint for one-time purchases (OTP) (00:00:00). Nikita Gorshkov preferred using a proper endpoint if the effort was the same as directing to Shopify (00:01:22), though they noted that if using a redirect to Shopify was significantly cheaper (e.g., 20% of the cost) it would be worthwhile (00:02:18). Beatrice Dimarucut confirmed that if it is faster, they would use the redirect, but expressed concerns about order management and needing to keep an entry point to direct customers back from Shopify (00:01:22).\n\n* Leveraging Existing Prospect Experience Beatrice Dimarucut noted that the prospect experience already includes a component that redirects users with a one-time purchase order back to the plans page to order another box or subscribe. They concluded that after implementing this work for prospects, it would not be a significant effort to do the same for active customers if no UI changes are needed (00:02:18). Beatrice Dimarucut suggested it would be easier to do the implementation with the endpoint unless linking to specific occasion or preset boxes was required, which would involve more work (00:03:37).\n\n* Capability of OTP for Active Customers The team discussed setting the OTP for active customers as a deliverable for Q1, which Nikita Gorshkov confirmed was already planned. Beatrice Dimarucut expressed lower confidence in the impact compared to the former customer use case, but Nikita Gorshkov emphasized that if the capability is cheap to deliver, it should be enabled, especially since they already support OTP for prospects and ex-customers. Nikita Gorshkov concluded that enabling OTP for active customers is \"pure money,\" as it can potentially earn revenue without extra spending, even from a small number of customers (00:05:15). Beatrice Dimarucut agreed to move forward with the minimal UI work and redirect to a plans page with the OTP option as the first iteration, which they would confirm with Alex (00:05:15).\n\n* Upcoming Abs\n\n\n\n.\n\nBeatrice Dimarucut: Yeah. So I yeah I I I think I just didn't outline it in the the doc because like formers and prospects seems like in my view like the yeah the bigger use cases but there's nothing stopping us I think.\n\n \n\n \n\n00:05:15\n\n \n\nBeatrice Dimarucut: Um why did you have this in mind that like to set it as a deliverable for H1 I mean like\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Well, it already for Q1. Yeah, it was already there, but it's okay. Um, yeah. Fine.\n\nBeatrice Dimarucut: yeah I from a technical perspective I don't think it's much work it's more just like I think from the use case perspective like I have I know I have lower confidence that it would do better than for example like former's use case.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: I think it's the wrong way to think about maybe I would think about this as sure the impact might not be there but I think the capability if it's cheap to deliver it the capability should be there if\n\nBeatrice Dimarucut: Mhm.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: you have already the possibility to have OTP for prospects so for new customers or for ex customers. There's absolutely zero reason for you not to enable it for um uh for activives, especially if we don't have and we don't have any support for um uh for activives uh sorry for for discounts. Any customer, even if it's two customers, it's still 700 bucks potentially that you could earn without spending a dime.\n\nBeatrice Dimarucut: Mhm. Yeah.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: It's pure money.\n\nBeatrice Dimarucut: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Um, and we can work and see and get feedback from customers. That's my\n\nBeatrice Dimarucut: Yeah. So I I I think if like the very first iteration is literally just to like expose this like minimal UI work and then you know redirect them back to um a plans page with the OTP option. Like I don't think that's a big lift. I can double check with Alex. If we're trying to link it with like maybe a slightly different product, so you know, occasion boxes, preset boxes, then that would be more work. But for the first one, like yeah, fair enough. I think we could do it first.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Nice.\n\nBeatrice Dimarucut: Okay, let me have a think where to place that. All right. Okay. Anything else?\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Cool. Nope.\n\n \n\n \n\nTranscription ended after 00:08:05\n\n\n\n\n\nThis editable transcript was computer generated and might contain errors. People can also change the text after it was created.",

They agreed on the need to define the smallest possible product and to test ideas by understanding pet owners' top worries through a survey, which Nikita Gorshkov confirmed the commercial team can easily incorporate into existing surveys. Prateek Jajoo inquired about the power user demographics, whom Nikita Gorshkov identified as \"dinks\" in metro areas, with high annual spending on their pets.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\nNotes Length: Standard\n\n* Content Strategy and App Development Nikita Gorshkov noted the company's weak history in content strategies and daily active user increases, which makes them cautious about investing heavily in content, despite recognizing the interest. They suggested finding easy ways to show users that their products improve pet health, which can then be used as social proof on the website. Prateek Jajoo connected this idea to the potential basis for a pet app, which Nikita Gorshkov affirmed could be a strong idea.\n\n* Testing Ideas and Customer Concerns Nikita Gorshkov emphasized the need to define the smallest possible product and, more importantly, to test interesting ideas to build confidence before committing significant resources. Prateek Jajoo suggested understanding the top five worries or thoughts a pet owner has about their pet to ensure that any app features or solutions address what customers truly care about, thus driving daily usage and engagement. Nikita Gorshkov agreed that providing basic tracking capabilities should be offered not only to active customers but potentially to any pet owners who download the app.\n\n* Surveying Pet Owners To understand customer thoughts, Prateek Jajoo suggested running a survey. Nikita Gorshkov confirmed that the commercial team already runs a survey every two weeks or monthly, and it would be easy to add additional questions due to a good response rate. They shared the contact of Lindsay within the TPT team, who typically runs these in-depth surveys, and offered to add Prateek Jajoo for visibility, mentioning that the latest one they had access to was from August.\n\n* Target Customer Demographics and Spending Prateek Jajoo inquired about the demographics of the power user customer. Nikita Gorshkov identified the power users as \"dinks\" (Dual Income, No Kids) in metro areas, who have the time, energy, and desire to pamper their pets with fresh frozen food, considering the increase in dog ownership and the perception of pets as children. Nikita Gorshkov noted that the average spend in the US per dog is $1.6k per year, emphasizing that this is a lot of money and the highest amount globally.\n\n* Customer Connection and Health Measurement Prateek Jajoo discussed the emotional attachment and time spent with a dog, suggesting owners would notice improvements in health or appearance, but proposed that the company should help measure and communicate those improvements rather than waiting for the customer to figure it out. Nikita Gorshkov agreed with the sentiment and suggested that Prateek Jajoo speak with Yara, who owns a dog named Boba and represents a good middle ground for their target audience, as she ensures their pet is healthy and happy. Prateek Jajoo connected this idea of measuring and communicating health improvements to solving the retention problem, comparing it to the high utility of services like Amazon Prime.\n\n* Next Steps and Design Bandwidth Prateek Jajoo stated that they would start working on the login page and write a one-pager for review to plan stage one and stage two for a quick win within one sprint. Prateek Jajoo expressed concern about Katrina's bandwidth for the design work. Nikita Gorshkov confirmed they are working to ensure Katrina has the necessary bandwidth and is pushing back on distractions from their senior director.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested next steps\n\n* Prateek Jajoo will start work on the login page and write a one-pager to review and make stage one and stage two plans for a quick win within one sprint.\n\n* Nikita Gorshkov will help Prateek Jajoo navigate where to find the survey and related information by sending the contact for Lindsay and adding Prateek Jajoo to the TPT team for visibility on the surveys.\n\n* Prateek Jajoo will work with the designer Katrina to ensure the right questions are being asked in the survey to get the right information.\n\n* Nikita Gorshkov will ensure that Katrina has the bandwidth for the design work.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should review Gemini's notes to make sure they're accurate.

Mert, not super comfy because refinement and dependency followups needed - Mert has session in flight for next week. \n\n      1. Generally, Mert would like to undercommit,and deliver rather than risking overcommitting and under delivering. He is following up with PMs\n\n      2.

Gabriel, flag fragments between new org structure and old lack of structure. Meaning it’s now hard to get clarity as there is no experience on what is needed for Elysium KTLO. This will impact realistic Q1 estimates but will get better with time, now it’s partly guesswork\n\n   4. Fernando raises concerns on Personalisation, no roadmap that he knows of.

Nikita, TPT conversion / retention split should 1:1:1 indication be there?\n\n      1. The gotya is these aren’t just squads but rather business, so 1:1:1 can’t always apply - autonomous calibration based on needs recommended, base on top prios\n\n      2. If hitting wall, escalate\n\n   6. Priyank, has a new KPI proposal  Shopping Platform - Vision 2026/KPIs  Miro\n\n      1. CTA comment on the doc\n\n   7.
