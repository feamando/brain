The participants addressed the need for image  \n\nconsistency across PDPs and debated adopting a more creative,  \n\nlifestyle-oriented approach to imagery, similar to Apple's design, rather  \n\nthan the current functional e-commerce carousel, with Hamed Karimian  \n\nagreeing to explore more creative PDP ideas with Michael. Nikita Gorshkov  \n\nchallenged the existing feasibility constraints, encouraging boldness, and  \n\nrecommended involving engineers early in creative discussions to facilitate  \n\nthe implementation of new ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested next steps\n\n\n\n\n\nHamed Karimian will work with Michael to ensure the design changes allow  \n\nall important details to be shown in the default view without scrolling.\n\n\n\nNikita Gorshkov will send Hamed Karimian the URL that was discussed.\n\n\n\nHamed Karimian will work with Michael to explore more creative, less  \n\ne-commercy ideas for the PDP page, and include engineers in those  \n\ndiscussions.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting records Document Notes by Gemini\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the summary section in this email helpful?\n\nNot Useful Email Useful Email\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle LLC, 1600 Ampitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA\n\n\n\nYou have received this email because meeting artifacts were initiated in  \n\nGoogle Meet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Thank you for joining our Q4 2025 Group All Hands!\nID: 19b324b726844648\nFrom: HelloFresh Group Announcements <announcements@hellofreshgroup.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\n[No readable text content found]\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Zoom meetings just got even more AI focused\nID: 19b323a9b774fc8e\nFrom: Mindstream <hello@mindstream.news>\n----------------------------------------\n\n----------\n\nThe Moon isn’t changing, you are.\n\n\n\nHead to the Southern Hemisphere, and the Moon appears upside down compared to how it looks in the Northern Hemisphere. \n\n\n\nThe famous “Man in the Moon”?

Katheryn Eckles  \n\nshared that influencer interviews revealed positive creator interest, but  \n\nstrong demand for clear monetization structure, efficient low-effort recipe  \n\nuploads (eg, automated nutrition facts), and enhanced filtering options on  \n\ncreator profiles, with concerns raised about the potential cost and time  \n\nimpact of the vetting process. Customer interviews showed high enthusiasm  \n\nfor the marketplace concept and a preference for low-commitment purchase  \n\nmodels, emphasizing the need for creator trust established through verified  \n\nbadges, transparent reviews, and links to original social media videos.  \n\nSomeone in Megan Thee Scallion (Canada - Toronto HQ, 2) proposed  \n\nintegrating vetted creator recipes into HelloFresh's active meal selection  \n\nfor existing subscribers, suggesting that creators be paid every time their  \n\nrecipe ships, while Sameer Doda provided updates on scoping the MVP for the  \n\none-time purchase experience, leading to a recognized challenge regarding  \n\nthe sequencing of customer-facing versus creator-facing capabilities due to  \n\nthe supply-driven nature of the platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested next steps\n\n\n\n\n\nKatheryn Eckles will bring up the question about the format of the recipes  \n\nin the final interview.\n\n\n\nSameer Doda will make changes and updates to the customer journey document,  \n\norganize more sessions to gather insights, and present the end-to-end  \n\ncustomer journey for the one-time purchase experience in the next session.\n\n\n\nSameer Doda will share updates on the scope of the MVP after the holidays.\n\n\n\nAnnette MvdE will add vacation dates to the shared document.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting records Document Notes by Gemini\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the summary section in this email helpful?\n\nNot Useful Email Useful Email\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle LLC, 1600 Ampitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA\n\n\n\nYou have received this email because meeting artifacts were initiated in  \n\nGoogle Meet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Updated invitation: Let’s toast to the New Year! - NV Tribe Dinner @ Tue Jan 27, 2026 6:30pm - 10:30pm (CET) (Nikita Gorshkov)\nID: 19b3232d5ad21824\nFrom: Maria Chelminska <maria.chelminska@hellofresh.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\n[No readable text content found]\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Invitation: VMS OTP UAT - Part 2 @ Tue Dec 30, 2025 3:30pm - 5pm (CET) (Nikita Gorshkov)\nID: 19b3219b8f13184a\nFrom: Hamed Karimian <hamed.karimian@hellofresh.ca>\n----------------------------------------\n\n[No readable text content found]\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Accessibility-2025 Program.

The directive applies to all\n\nbusinesses in the EU, including HelloFresh and Factor. Non-compliance can\n\nresult in penalties such as fines (up to €500K) or, in some countries like\n\nIreland, even 18 months of prison sentences.\n\n\n\nAs a reaction to a new law, HelloTech Objective #4\n\n<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YCKnWvWNLNEI3FgtIUuBFaLK7ZXqOfnGAdP4R72JxaQ/edit?tab=t.0#bookmark=id.fznoddvvfahg>\n\nand a follow-up Accessibility-2025 Program\n\n<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LwrtHRYx5pqta9k7dqKHJBfnwQOD5RH637JcxaA4tLY/edit?pli=1&gid=1881360676#gid=1881360676>\n\nwere formed.\n\n\n\nThe program had 2 goals:\n\n\n\nGoal\n\n\n\nDid we achieve it?\n\n\n\nReduce the number of \"important\" Accessibility issues in HelloFresh,\n\nGreenChef, and Factor by 90% in WE\n\n\n\nchter \n\n(Vorsitzender), Thomas W.

Addressing Nikita  \n\nGorshkov's query about shortening time to market and running parallel  \n\nexperiments, Gabriel Gregório suggested incorporating faster research  \n\nmethods like social media surveys or third-party small-group testing  \n\nalongside traditional A/B testing, citing an example of using two-way  \n\nmessaging for payment reminders at a bank. Gabriel Gregório also offered  \n\nregion-specific qualitative methods for Brazil, like in-app surveys with  \n\ndiscounts, and quantitative methods, such as engaging campaigns or  \n\ncompetitions to gather measurable data on potential new users and order  \n\nfrequency, while Nikita Gorshkov clarified that their company is globally  \n\nhiring for an analytics role and has not yet expanded to Brazil due to  \n\nrequirements around \"meat culture,\" pricing, and infrastructure, though the  \n\nmarket is considered interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested next steps\n\n\n\n\n\nNikita Gorshkov will provide the feedback to the global talent agency today.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting records Document Notes by Gemini\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the summary section in this email helpful?\n\nNot Useful Email Useful Email\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle LLC, 1600 Ampitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA\n\n\n\nYou have received this email because meeting artifacts were initiated in  \n\nGoogle Meet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Updated invitation: Influencer MP: EOY Review @ Thu Dec 18, 2025 4pm - 5pm (CET) (Nikita Gorshkov)\nID: 19b31f9666957d66\nFrom: Ian Brooks <ian@hellofresh.ca>\n----------------------------------------\n\n[No readable text content found]\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Dokument abgeschlossen - Vertrag für Ihre Veranstaltung in den RIVO Spreeterrassen\nID: 19b31f300e2e0be8\nFrom: \"Jessica Umlauf via Xodo Sign (formerly eversign)\" <delivery@eversign.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\">\n\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n\n<head>\n\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;
