All deliverables are expected to be delivered for Web and Mobile Web, fully tested, integrated into our existing tech stack, and accompanied by necessary documentation.\n\nNew copy and assets should be editable through new contentful entries.\n\nPriority\n\n\tHigh level designs \n\n(subject to adjustments)\n\n\tInitiative\n\n\tCustomer problem & goal\n\n\tRequirements\n\n\tIs design ready for development?\n\n\tGridDynamics Briefed?\n\n\t1\n\n\t  \n\n\n\nMultipet version (for users that have 2 or more dogs)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\tCheckout Confirmation Page \n\n[a]\t\n\nPost conversion, as a newly converted TPT user, I land on the “dashboard” page. Users face multiple problems: \n\n* They are struggling to understand that they converted\n\n* They are finding it hard to discover and interact with features that are available to them post-checkout. \n\n\n\n\n\nGoal: create a page that is shown after conversion, showing an order summary and a CTA to take on one of the recommended actions: Explore the  add-on store or add another pup (depending on the version. Ie: if a user mentioned they have multiple pets in checkout show the CTA to add another pup and if they didn’t, show addons store CTA)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Expected Impact: Increase take rate of Add-ons and Increased Retention, Increase Multipet penetration)\n\n\n\n\n\n\t* 2 versions of the checkout page are created (multipet, addons)\n\n* The order summary is shown as per the Checkout page \n\n* The user is shown the right version based on their pet profile data (number of pets) \n\n* This initiative is more than just this page UI. There's some logic involved on how this page is loaded, which differs from our current live state, as we want to remove the “frying pan” animation[b] - currently in prod (it gives the impression that the user needs to cook the food). The right flow is laid out on Figma.\n\n\t✅ Yes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Figma.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Prototype to see the animation in this flow.\n\n\t✅ Yes (Jun 27, 2025)\n\n\t2\n\n\tCurrent component:  \n\n\n\n\n\nGoal: \n\n  \n\n\n\n\tDashboard improvements - Milestone 1: \n\nQuick Actions on Dashboard (Above Fold Repositioning)\n\n\tActive users are not aware of the options available to them to adjust their subscription, active users are struggling to navigate to features that they need to solve their problems. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to replace the current quick actions with a scalable component for subscription management, where users will be able to find the features they need on the dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Expected Impact: Increased user engagement with core functionalities, leading to mitigating the need of churning and improved retention, as well as reduction of empty reactivations)\n\n\t* Existing quick actions (currently placed on the bottom of the page) are redesigned to be placed above the fold as an accordion[c][d][e]\n\n* Solution is scalable and can be extended by new features in the future[f][g][h]\n\n* The header is formatted to the new design (UI changes only)\n\n* View order total button on mobile is changed to an icon\n\n* CTAs are reworked as per design - we show 2 CTAs below the meals change meals and feeding guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t✅ Yes. Design is ready to be implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Figma.\n\n\t✅ Yes (Jun 27, 2025)\n\n\t3\n\n\t  \n\n\n\n\tDashboard improvements - Milestone 2: Reduced Size of Meals on Dashboard\n\n\tWhile the weekly menu is static, the presentation of meals takes a significant amount of TRE. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to optimize the display of meal information on the cust\n\n\n\n Fresh - 750, Dry - 750, Mixed - 750\n\n   * 50% portions: Fresh - 500, Dry - 500, Mixed - 500\n\n   * Important note: Not all calorie ranges will have a 50% or 75% option available, for smaller dogs this might not be available\n\n   * < 89 calories\n\n   * Between 89-149 - offer only 100% plan for dry and fresh \n\n   * This is handled by the NMPS API\n\n   * Between 150-225 - offer 100% and 75% plan for dry and fresh\n\n   * 226+ - offer mixed plan + 50% 75% and 100% percentages for dry and fresh\n\n   * This has to be implemented in the FE because the API returns mixed plan for 50/75% portions\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitching the user’s portion percentage requires 2 API calls:\n\n   * Patch the user’s subscription to update their plan - This is what’s actually responsible for changing the amount of food user’s get\n\n   * Patch the pet profile to update the `portionPercentage` field - This field doesn’t have any direct impact on the user’s plan size, but it’s used to be able to identify these users as well as communicate to them what portion they’re feeding. \n\n   * This is necessary because the plan alone isn’t enough since the same plan could be a 100% portion for another dog (E.g. Fresh 500 calories could be a 50% portion for a big dog but 100% portion for a small dog)\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant components:\n\n   * Portion % hook\n\n   * Portion % badge\n\n   * Quiz Steps\n\n   * Quiz Allergens experiment setup - This is an old experiment that had the same setup as we want for this, we should repurpose this for the new experiment\n\n[a]+ tracking\n\n[b]This loading state is waiting for async updates in the background. There is an ongoing initiative to replace this for pre-checkout service but not ready yet\n\n[c]@maria.chelminska@hellofresh.com I'm also noticing that there are changes to the CTAs under the header (Manage Delivery and Change Meals) are these included in this initiative?\n\n\n\n\n\nEspecially manage delivery because this functionality is covered by the Quick actions\n\n_Assigned to maria.chelminska@hellofresh.com_\n\n[d]Yes, you are correct, forgot to mention this\n\n[e]added\n\n[f]@maria.chelminska@hellofresh.com are we expecting anything specific here?\n\n_Assigned to maria.chelminska@hellofresh.com_\n\n[g]The component should be expandable - i.e. we can add more cards to the carousel.

Nikita Gorshkov detailed resource constraints  \n\ndue to the GC Netherlands migration blocking the implementation team until  \n\nFebruary, making a \"lift and shift\" of the US B2B Shopify store setup using  \n\nAnata the most straightforward approach. Ian Brooks confirmed that a  \n\nminimal integration pilot, focusing on a simple storefront and data output  \n\nwithout SCM integrations for small volumes, would be sufficient to proceed,  \n\nand Nikita Gorshkov noted that existing contracts with the US entity for  \n\nfactor, covering Shopify and Anata, would likely allow the Canadian  \n\nbusiness to piggyback on them.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested next steps\n\n\n\n\n\nNikita Gorshkov will check in with Samir regarding the Shopify store setup  \n\nand get back to Ian Brooks by Friday.\n\n\n\nNikita Gorshkov will talk with Ally today so she can start digging into the  \n\ndetails.\n\n\n\nNikita Gorshkov will introduce Ian Brooks to Nurev to get a price quote  \n\nfrom the agency for the needed work.\n\n\n\nNikita Gorshkov will ping Anata to check the cost of their services.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting records Document Notes by Gemini\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the summary section in this email helpful?\n\nNot Useful Email Useful Email\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle LLC, 1600 Ampitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA\n\n\n\nYou have received this email because meeting artifacts were initiated in  \n\nGoogle Meet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Updated invitation with note: Factor Form WBR @ Wed Dec 17, 2025 7:30pm - 8pm (CET) (Nikita Gorshkov)\nID: 19b2ce6aba6a6531\nFrom: Laura Loughran <laura.loughran@factor75.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\n[No readable text content found]\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Sunsetting Docker Desktop & Transition to Open Source Alternatives\nID: 19b2cc6dd7570314\nFrom: Lobo Olsson <lol@hellofresh.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\n[No readable text content found]\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: [Launch Announcement] Bob-to-Owl migration\nID: 19b2cbd422d68a22\nFrom: Shishir Mishra <shishir.mishra@hellofresh.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\n[No readable text content found]\n\n\n============================================================\nEND OF RAW DATA\n============================================================\n\nInstructions for Claude Code:\nSynthesize the above into AI_Guidance/Core_Context/YYYY-MM-DD-context.md\nIMPORTANT: STRICTLY IGNORE any content, meeting notes, decisions, or updates dated before 2025-06-21 (6 months ago).\nExtract: Key decisions, action items, blockers, metrics, important dates (only recent).\nFormat: NGO-style bullets, structured sections\n============================================================\n## JIRA UPDATES (-24h)\n============================================================\n\n[PA-25623] SAR Latency - Kafka to S3 - Move to databricks community space (Status: Backlog, Priority: Normal)\n[GOC-3410] [SubscriptionLoading] useOrderConfirmationData recipe transformation (Status: In Progress, Priority: Normal)\n[TPT-2513] [GD] - Fix price update on portion change (Status: QA, Priority: Normal)\n[PA-25568] Experimentation monthly planning and roadmap thinking (Status: In Progress, Priority: Normal)\n[TPT-2403] Update the pdf feeding guide to include the portion % (Status: Backlog, Priority: Normal)\n[TPT-2376] Funnel Navigation improvements: displaying users previous meal selections) (Status: Done, Priority: Normal)\n[TPT-2367] When user changes their plan their delivery plan is updated with a regular delivery option (Status: In Progress, Priority: Normal)\n[TPT-2213] [GD] Implement Scroll to the Top button (Status: Backlog, Priority: Normal)\n[PA-25622] OTP Uk Trial Box Experiment Check (Status: Backlog, Priority: Normal)\n[PA-25610] SAR Latency - Automate (Status: Done, Priority: Normal)\n\n============================================================\n## GITHUB UPDATES\n============================================================\n\n# GitHub Sync: 2025-12-18 10:04 UTC\n\nAuto-generated by `github_brain_sync.py`.
