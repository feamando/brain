The primary goal of the \"Dashboard Simplification and Excitement\" initiative is to streamline the subscription management experience for existing The Pets Table users while enhancing engagement and emotional connection\n\n\tCreated At: Dec 2, 2025\n\n\tLast Updated: Dec 18, 2025\n\n\tEditor(s): Maria Chelminska\n\n\tStrategy: xxx\n\n\tFigma: TBD\n\n\tBusiness Scoping Doc: Scoping document: improving actives dashboard experience\n\nActive UX Experience Initiative-Dec 2025\n\n\t\n\n\n\nGoal & Vision\n\nThe primary goal of the \"Dashboard Simplification and Excitement\" initiative is to streamline the subscription management experience for existing The Pets Table users while enhancing engagement and emotional connection.[a][b]\n\nThe current user Dashboard suffers from several usability issues, primarily stemming from inherited design elements from the HelloFresh Group (e.g., the multi-week calendar navigation, as seen in the screenshot) and poor information hierarchy. Key problems include:\n\n* Wasted Space: Excessive use of space for non-critical information (e.g., future week navigation) and poor mobile visibility.\n\n* Low Discoverability of the Pet Switcher for multi-pet households is difficult to locate.[c][d]\n\n* Low Excitement: The page is overly transactional, lacking personal elements (pet photos) and content (feeding tips) that foster an emotional connection.\n\n* Poor Add-on Visibility: Add-ons are not prominently featured, resulting in missed upsell opportunities, particularly on mobile devices.\n\nVision: A clean, intuitive, and emotionally engaging user dashboard that makes managing a The Pets Table subscription effortless and exciting:\n\nSuccess Metrics:\n\n* Increase AOR\n\n* Increase DAU (Daily Active Users)\n\n* Increase Clicks on Pet Switcher\n\n* Decrease Time to find next-delivery management options (e.g., \"Change meals\")\n\n* Increase Add ons take rate\n\n* Increase Engagement by launching new \"Excitement\" features (such as Pet Photo Upload)\n\n\n\n\n\nScope\n\nComponents that are not subject to change as part of this initiative  \n\n* Quick actions navigation \n\n* Pet Profile page (for now) - separate initiative, but we can reprioritize the roadmap and start with the pet profile improvement \n\n* Our products page - separate initiative\n\n\n\n\n\nThis initiative focuses on a complete overhaul of the Active User Dashboard experience across both desktop and mobile views. Ideas: \n\n1. Reworking the header / burger menu - improving navigation:\n\n   1. Deciding on the placement of different pages in Header / footer\n\n      1. Putting more emphasis on pages (Header)\n\n         1. Dashboard (consider changing name to “Home”) \n\n         2. Pet Profile (for now link to Settinfs, in the future take it out from Settings and create a separate page)\n\n         3. RAF (“Send free food” copy to draw more attention)\n\n         4. Contact Us\n\n      2. TBD\n\n         1. Add-ons Store - tbd, if header of exposing more on the dashboard (this would require to create a separate page as GoC is doing) [e][f][g]\n\n         2. Feeding Guide - are entry points on dashboard enough, or does it require additional? \n\n      3. Move to the footer: \n\n         1. FAQ\n\n         2. Our Kitchen\n\n         3. Why Switch\n\n         4. Reviews\n\n         5. About Us[h]\n\n   2. Aligning on the order of the pages \n\n   3. Changes in the UI \n\n      1. Changes in the UI will mean branching out from the WL code - additional overhead costs for\n\n\n\n1 total reaction\n\nMaria Chelminska reacted with 👍 at 2025-12-23 09:55 AM\n\n[i]I think this only makes sense IF we do something with this data\n\n[j]check number of interactions\n\n[k]@maria.chelminska@hellofresh.com has this come up through customer feedback as an issue?\n\n_Assigned to maria.chelminska@hellofresh.com_\n\n[l]There are some comments about this in sprig. While we wont find comments like \"please add images\", showing more details about the delivery might improve the value perception. \n\n\n\n\n\ne.g. \n\n1. When you send an order, you should put on the website EXACTLY what was ordered, not just price. What exactly is \"4 weeks of food\"? How many bags of each flavor were sent? I want to be able to see each order in its entirety. I also would like an email stating that my order is getting ready to be sent and what is about to be sent to me. This is way too vague for my taste, and I don't want my info shared with other parties!\n\nWhat is the monthly price for each delivery\n\n2. Show price in cart. I tried to order for my 2nd dog, and overweight Italian Greyhound, and her pkg was not given the 50% off for her trial box...so 50+ for hers and 31 for Ginger. I feel that is not right, so I did nor order for Ginger.\n\n3. It is already great, but your prices are a over whelming.\n\n[m]I think all of these comments are related to different things i.e.\n\n1 = clarity on quantity of product in box\n\n2 = multipet discount\n\n3 = lower prices\n\n[n]May be also give an entry point to customers to provide feedback on the recent box or how much their pet liked it?\n\n[o]Overall I like the idea, but we do not support reviews on the website. This would need to be enabled\n\n[p]BB shows a video on the RAF page for \"why your friends will love BNB\" which is a product benefits video (which we also have) that could work well\n\n[q]@maria.chelminska@hellofresh.com I think this product marketing initiative should be expanded to:\n\n- % Stats\n\n- Social proof\n\n- Product claims\n\n\n\n\n\nThis needs more scoping & I don't have a clear plan on where it would go but I do think we need more content which drives repurchase and reminds people why the product is so good\n\n[r]agree, this should be our focus to think of these placements, but also find natural positioning of the product claims. \n\n\n\n\n\n@rena.zhou@hellofresh.com Could you help me with coming up with the list of our top product claims which we would like to expose?\n\n\n============================================================\n## EMAIL CONTENTS\n============================================================\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Re: Payment status is reflected incorrectly in BOB/OWL\nID: 19b4b7fd268bb7f2\nFrom: Max Schultze <max.schultze@hellofresh.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\nHi Team\n\n\n\nWe are investigating this issue in the channel -\n\nhttps://hellofresh.slack.com/archives/C0A56M4L96J\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at 2:54 PM Gangadharan Khoteeswarun <\n\ngangadharan.khoteeswarun@hellofresh.com> wrote:\n\n\n\n> Hey Team,\n\n>\n\n> The payments are successful on PSP and PPS DB, however its not getting\n\n> correctly reflected in BOB/OWL.
