Overview & Purpose\n\nThis PRD outlines the requirements for unifying the cancellation funnels across all HelloFresh Group brands. The primary goal is to leverage the existing HelloFresh cancellation funnel, including its deflection strategies and cancellation survey, and apply it to the remaining RTE, meal kit and new venture brands. This initiative aims to standardize the cancellation experience, improve customer retention for Factor and other brands, and streamline operational and technical maintenance. Depending on the engineering complexity, we consider two possible rollout scenarios:\n\n1. [preferred] A/B test for all brands excl. Hellofresh, with control = BAU and variation = complete unified funnel. Alternatively, the test can target Factor US customers only.\n\n2. Roll out without an A/B test, with the pre-post performance analysis\n\nDecision about the prioritised rollout scenario will be taken by Karolina Zak/Edward Day once the effort estimation is known.\n\n2. Goals & Non-Goals\n\nGoals:\n\n1. Use Hellofresh Cancellation Funnel UX in the remaining brands: Replicate the proven HelloFresh cancellation flow UX, including deflections and feedback collection, onto the other brands (all meal-kit, all RTE, The PetsTable, GoodChop, Factor Form, ?Factor Programs?[a][b][c][d]).\n\n   1. !! This requirement does not mean using Hellofresh funnel code across brands. The initial engineering proposal is to create a new cancellation funnel module and move the Hellofresh flow pieces into this new cross-brand funnel. Once this is setup we can migrate the funnels to use this new app\n\n2. Easy handling of all funnel variations: all the existing cancellation funnel variations (BAU flow, one-step funnel, one-click funnel, French adjusted funnel) need to be handled in a scalable way and allow reusing existing flows in other brands and markets\n\n3. Standardize Cancellation Surveys: Implement the HelloFresh cancellation survey framework for other brands to gather consistent customer feedback on reasons for cancellation.\n\n4. Unify Deflection Strategies: Make all existing deflection mechanisms available for use (not necessarily enabled) in all other brands cancellation funnels, including:\n\n   1. Special deflections offered in a dedicated page sections:\n\n      1. Benefits of keeping the subscription active (available discounts & credits, loyalty program status) → do not show if a customer doesn’t have a discount nor credit nor loyalty program status\n\n      2. Switch to other brand (offered post cancellation) → Removed from the initiative scope. Remember to keep it live for Hellofresh brand.\n\n   2. Regular deflections offered in small modular boxes:\n\n      1. Offer new discount - Emmanuelle Hazeauxto clarify the ownership of the voucher creation for all brands and markets → changed from special deflection to the regular module - needs small design change\n\n      2. Change plan frequency → links to the second step of the deflection, where customers can select alternative plan frequency\n\n      3. Change plan size → there’s no price information, it has one of the lowest deflection rates. Therefore in the new funnel we want to send customers directly to the subscription settings page (!different links for different brands: HF /account-settings/subscription-settings, Factor /settings/plan/plan-selection)\n\n      4. Help me skip → change to “Skip instead of cancel”, redirect to the homepage/single week page with a simple onboarding about using “Edit delivery” feature (only if skipping CTA is hidden\n\n\n\nl not support having an active RTE subscription without an active meal kit subscription so for launch we added an \"orchestration layer\" that cancels the RTE subscription when the meal kit subscription is cancelled\n\n[p]@nikita.gorshkov@hellofresh.com @kza@hellofresh.com It's not clear to me what consequences this project has for analytics - are cancellation metrics and GA events already aligned cross-brand or would we have to shake up our events and reporting as part of this push?\n\n\n\n\n\nHow about dashboarding?\n\n[q]+ revisit the cancellation dashboard\n\n[r]I think this needs to be investigated a bit further, but general cancellation metrics should be unified overal (at least looking at Tableau as the SoT here). Of course, cancellation reason-level reporting is different.\n\n[s]what about Voice of customer team, should we we consider them as dependencies as they are the primary users of the cancellation survey results, maybe we need to check how it would impact them\n\n1 total reaction\n\nJuan Sebastian Hernandez reacted with 🙏 at 2025-09-05 15:25 PM\n\n[t]Who would be your primary contact for this team?\n\n[u]@juan.hernandez@hellofresh.com\n\n[v]@kza@hellofresh.com my read from this is that we don't make any changes to the BAU survey experience for any brand/market other than maybe the UI - am I right in this?\n\n[w]Hey team, hope you're doing well and thanks for flagging @ehaz@hellofresh.co. I assume that from our end there is no big change as we only send the comments to Chattermill. Not sure if this would affect more the existing categories in Cancellation data sets, so I'll add @winnie.huang@hellofresh.com to the conversation\n\n[x]Q on my side - how do we ensure market level compliance?\n\n[y]what do you mean by compliance? Compliance to regulations?\n\n[z]Yes cancellation tends to be regulated at a local level.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn top of legal compliance, I wonder if there are non-legal decisions we've taken at a local level that we also should look to preserve\n\n[aa]Q2: Governance - the ability to change survey & deflections by brand/market will only be available to the owning _technical_ team right? We have no requirements to enable other stakeholders to modify this?\n\n[ab]If so, it means owning tech team owns final decision on local setups (with local input) due to balancing capacity\n\n[ac]i don't know why i imagined green chef being also sustainable so i'm curious why is not there today\n\n\n============================================================\n## EMAIL CONTENTS\n============================================================\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Monthly Data Quality Audit\nID: 19b2663fcfb1723e\nFrom: \"Workday@HelloFresh\" <hellofresh@myworkday.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\n[No readable text content found]\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: [Launch Announcement] Mixpanel Launch: Explore Customer Journeys Without SQL\nID: 19b26553c216ea04\nFrom: Rahul Ranjan <r.ranjan@hellofresh.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\n[No readable text content found]\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Re: Snowflake disruption | AWS - US West (Oregon) & AWS - Europe (Ireland)\nID: 19b2649e8b996d91\nFrom: Varun Jayaram <varun.subramanian@hellofresh.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\n[No readable text content found]\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Snowflake disruption | AWS - US West (Oregon) & AWS - Europe (Ireland)\nID: 19b264366661d41b\nFrom: Barath Badrachalam Kannan <barath.kannan@hellofresh.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\n[No readable text content found]\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Evals and Observability - Intro\nID: 19b263d80de5ddca\nFrom: Sacha Thompson-Sargoni <sacha@braintrustdata.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\n[No readable text content found]\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Now in Cursor: Web Layout Editor and Debug Mode\nID: 19b262bfdbd09ac0\nFrom: Cursor Team <hi@mail.cursor.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\nHello,\n\n\n\nWe're releasing two new features that make writing and fixing code faster: a browser-based layout editor and Debug Mode.\n\n\n\nBrowser Layout Editor\n\n\n\nDesign and code simultaneously with the new layout and style editor ( https://cursor.com/blog/browser-visual-editor ) built into the Cursor browser. Drag and drop components, update colors using your design system, build layouts and grids, and add shadows or gradients as needed.\n\n\n\nOnce the design is perfect, click “Apply” to delegate your visual changes to the agent.\n\n\n\nDebug Mode\n\n\n\nDebug Mode ( https://cursor.com/blog/debug-mode ) is a new way to fix tricky bugs. Instead of writing new code, prompt the agent with a description of the issue. Then, the agent explores your codebase, adds instrumentation, and uses runtime logs to find and fix the root cause.\n\n\n\nTry Debug Mode and everything else new in Cursor 2.2 ( https://cursor.com/changelog/2-2 ).\n\n\n\nWe’re excited to see how you use it!\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nCursor Team\n\n\n\nUnsubscribe ( https://track.customer.io/unsubscribe/dgT_pwsDANT_zQXT_80FAZskr7InpW4rB63G3_n0jw== )\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: ITH-225093 [Contentful] Access Request for Prateek Jajoo\nID: 19b25f7772173758\nFrom: Automation for Jira <jira@hellofresh.atlassian.net>\n----------------------------------------\n\n—-—-—-—\n\n\n\nReply above this line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomation for Jira changed the status to Closed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView request: https://hellofresh.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/ITH-225093?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0Z3QiOiJhbm9ueW1vdXMtbGluayIsInFzaCI6IjEyZjVlOGU4ODBhYTRlZGJlZGI0YmRlMTM4MjA5NDgxOTlkMzAzODg1NWY3MmRiOGM4MzVjNDg2ZTRiYmJhMzYiLCJpc3MiOiJzZXJ2aWNlZGVzay1qd3QtdG9rZW4taXNzdWVyIiwiY29udGV4dCI6eyJ1c2VyIjoiNjMxODMiLCJpc3N1ZSI6IklUSC0yMjUwOTMifSwiZXhwIjoxNzY4Mjg3NzI3LCJpYXQiOjE3NjU4Njg1Mjd9.m5yRQ4kpGHIBqFqXYDO6Rn4dm2mRTwNRvHcyyyiulsA&sda_source=notification-email\n\n\n\nTurn off this request's notifications: https://hellofresh.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/ITH-225093/unsubscribe?jwt=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0Z3QiOiJhbm9ueW1vdXMtbGluayIsInFzaCI6IjgwY2Y1NGE1MDdmYmZiYmMwYTI0MTViYjk3MmNiNGZhZGQ0MTBjZDAwYmFhNDQwNzY4NmU4M2FlZTg3ZTU2YTQiLCJpc3MiOiJzZXJ2aWNlZGVzay1qd3QtdG9rZW4taXNzdWVyIiwiY29udGV4dCI6eyJ1c2VyIjoiZjI2ZTI1ODgtNWFkNy00ZjMwLTg1MDctN2Q2ZGRkMTYxMGI1IiwiaXNzdWUiOiJJVEgtMjI1MDkzIn0sImV4cCI6MTc2ODI4NzcyNywiaWF0IjoxNzY1ODY4NTI3fQ.kggvfdq22maqCPbeFbSjqxiscBRMl5ZykRk2jf08PPI\n\n\n\nThis is shared with Prateek Jajoo and Nikita Gorshkov\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nPowered by Jira Service Desk\n\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-desk/powered-by?utm_medium=jira-in-product&utm_source=jira_service_desk_email_footer&utm_content=hellofresh\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: ITH-225083 Contentful Access\nID: 19b25f76b92bd5de\nFrom: Automation for Jira <jira@hellofresh.atlassian.net>\n----------------------------------------\n\n—-—-—-—\n\n\n\nReply above this line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomation for Jira changed the status to Closed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView request: https://hellofresh.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/ITH-225083?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0Z3QiOiJhbm9ueW1vdXMtbGluayIsInFzaCI6ImRjMTIzOTc2YjdlOTVkOTM3ODA1YTkxZDJhMDkxMjViMzA3ZjUyYzlmOTBhMDkwNmE2YTE1ZTQyZDE4OGQ3N2YiLCJpc3MiOiJzZXJ2aWNlZGVzay1qd3QtdG9rZW4taXNzdWVyIiwiY29udGV4dCI6eyJ1c2VyIjoiNjMxODMiLCJpc3N1ZSI6IklUSC0yMjUwODMifSwiZXhwIjoxNzY4Mjg3NzI3LCJpYXQiOjE3NjU4Njg1Mjd9.ufK67u3hp38ntDdOavbAGVwNLloTOP0mLfSe6Nc9KY4&sda_source=notification-email\n\n\n\nTurn off this request's notifications: https://hellofresh.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/ITH-225083/unsubscribe?jwt=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0Z3QiOiJhbm9ueW1vdXMtbGluayIsInFzaCI6ImQ5NTUyYTMwM2Q2Yzk1ZDBjZmFjZDUxMjNjOTQ2YzNmYTVkODY0OGEzODk1MmVjOTNmMDc4NTM4MzM2MGMxNGIiLCJpc3MiOiJzZXJ2aWNlZGVzay1qd3QtdG9rZW4taXNzdWVyIiwiY29udGV4dCI6eyJ1c2VyIjoiZjI2ZTI1ODgtNWFkNy00ZjMwLTg1MDctN2Q2ZGRkMTYxMGI1IiwiaXNzdWUiOiJJVEgtMjI1MDgzIn0sImV4cCI6MTc2ODI4NzcyNywiaWF0IjoxNzY1ODY4NTI3fQ.V3WwzI1N1vIV8_l0MVTfC9GSklq7fbwBhLEI-5nsDOY\n\n\n\nThis is shared with Prateek Jajoo, Nikita Gorshkov, and Jon de los Santos\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nPowered by Jira Service Desk\n\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-desk/powered-by?utm_medium=jira-in-product&utm_source=jira_service_desk_email_footer&utm_content=hellofresh\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Re: Youfoodz Checkout Critical -

Nikita Gorshkov emphasized that the  \n\nsuccess of B2B depends on a strong sales presence, and confirmed that zero  \n\npeople are currently allocated to B2B development, with expectations that a  \n\ndedicated B2B team may be pushed for around June, leading Elysa Viti to  \n\nestimate a Q3 launch for the Shopify integration. The strategy for the  \n\nfirst half of the year involves manually testing streams like sports teams  \n\nand gyms, and Elysa Viti suggested a separate team should handle B2B.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested next steps\n\n\n\n\n\nElysa Viti will talk to Kieran and have him send over his business case so  \n\nthat she can tweak it for Canada.\n\n\n\nElysa Viti will forward all meeting notes over to Kevin and Cole for them  \n\nto read up on and will keep Nikita Gorshkov posted on any questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting records Document Notes by Gemini\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the summary section in this email helpful?\n\nNot Useful Email Useful Email\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle LLC, 1600 Ampitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA\n\n\n\nYou have received this email because meeting artifacts were initiated in  \n\nGoogle Meet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Re: [PA Request]\nID: 19b22d866d828f22\nFrom: JM Sanchez <joe@activatetalent.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\nHi Nikita and Zafer,\n\n\n\nWe'd like to endorse these candidates for the *Senior* *Product Analyst*\n\nposition:\n\n*Ritika Kakkar*\n\n<https://d5q0tJ04.na1.hs-sales-engage.com/Ctc/JA+23284/d5q0tJ04/Jll2-6qcW7Y8-PT6lZ3p6W37L9fv1mzpMtV-Lklq1X2s_gW9glxHm51sNCcW94mJT35gX5pJN5X7R7q90l0WW8mjq2G8GNH4SW83Tpz56TrFWLW33lKwM6B0fV2W4zl3L56M7PYNW3w2mrs7_f0zFW266bt446twtpW5KT-RF3j8RMfW5b7kNM130bp1W5sylCR457xPTN67QvDR9m4YKW8dC2Kj3MkrkxW8hmdzp3XKNqZN3gg-lkyC9czW4lPGdk2-Y1HkW228r0k5-rwLXW1zKzSH5c6R3bW5YdNrw5Z9StCW8L6hrp7sdRtfW2KpCvD3xc729W3Bpfkv2NQV6nW8nMVBt6rZD6nf5NHtRH04>\n\n*Luciana Romero Ortiz*\n\n<https://d5q0tJ04.na1.hs-sales-engage.com/Ctc/JA+23284/d5q0tJ04/Jll2-6qcW7Y8-PT6lZ3lsN2K9C01ZPwk0W17DZ3B8W00rmW5HlLkB6XnywkW7Dt-yp1m3LdbN1X2_6shzC1TW4r5crj72qwhwW468rTY8b3zKPW2jmkpr1CPZP9W6fw8qG7k6HCgW488hjv4BkdfzW22sdwP2-FZN_N13Z--zRzR34W9461P557KdmzW1hbpZQ4-P-SYW3rlXyT3DfkMDW74L6jT2PMh7DW3wdgSK3CpsjGW17Kphk4sc34DW286mmd3n-5WsW5W3Lb_7Ry9V7W4dmJPQ7CMGPXW683rhX65r0pBW29_MCy8f5J1CW8c_8_h71Z2QKN3kNnSxR-TsVW3fPKGv5P_Yn9f3nmscK04>\n\n\n\nAre you available to interview this week?\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Nov 19, 2025 at 3:49 PM Zafer Zeren <zafer.zeren@hellofresh.com>\n\nwrote:\n\n\n\n> We are testing for their approach to A/B testing as well as a live SQL\n\n> coding exercise\n\n>\n\n> On Wed, Nov 19, 2025 at 8:48 AM JM Sanchez <joe@activatetalent.com> wrote:\n\n>\n\n>> Hi Zafer,\n\n>>\n\n>> Thank you for the response.\n\n>>\n\n>> Any specific variables in the technical interview that we can focus on,\n\n>> on our sourcing efforts?\n\n>>\n\n>> On Wed, 19 Nov\n\n\n\nr please contact the\n\n>>> sender (by return e-mail) immediately and delete this message.
