Prototype & Validate: MVP Blueprint\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t0. Setup & Alignment\n\n\tCurrent Sprint\n\n\tSprint 3, week 2\n\n\tCurrent Status\n\n\tOn time \n\n\tHand-over to Squad\n\n\tProbably Jan 2026, Squad: Wanderley Teixeira\n\n\tLaunch\n\n\tCA first\n\n\t\n\n\n\nProblem Statement\n\nSocial media has become a primary hub for culinary inspiration, where people turn to influencers to discover new recipes. While Followers struggle to find the necessary ingredients and an easy way to re-cook them, Influencers look for new revenue streams to be more independent from the heavily controlled platforms and find new ways to expand their reach and engage with their audiences authentically and organically via food.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpportunity:\n\nHellofresh sees a huge opportunity to serve both: by transforming influencers' inspiration (recipe) into a shoppable, cookable meal kit for the consumers. \n\nBy bridging the gap as the Expert in operation, warehouses and logistics, we provide customers a way to enjoy these recipes easily and the influencer to serve their followers and create a new revenue stream. The social commerce market is growing rapidly and can represent a huge opportunity for us to attract new customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy now:\n\nWe see the urgency to act now, because influencers are already trying to solve this problem with links to ingredient orders  via Instacart or Pinterest partners with Instacart to enable 1-click grocery list generation from saved pins. But today, shoppable content on social media within the food category is often limited to individual food items as opposed to a holistic offering where the ingredients for entire recipes and direct delivery can be purchased. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Core Ask \n\nWBD: Influencer Marketplace\n\nExplore desired and viable vision for a curated recipe creator marketplace (1. influencer, 2. Aggregators) with the option of an  instant purchase as a meal kit ‘fulfilled by HelloFresh’.\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-term Vision (Later) \n\nTransform HelloFresh into the “Spotify for food”  a platform where any creator can share a recipe that HelloFresh fulfills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEssential Navigation Hub\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\n\tDocument / Asset\n\n\tLinks\n\n\tOwner\n\n\tBrief\n\n\tWorking Backwards Document (WBD)\n\n\tWBD: Influencer Marketplace\n\n\tNikita Gorshkov\n\n\tPlanning\n\n\tRoadmap + Sprint Plan\n\n\tInfluencer Marketplace – Source of truth\n\n\tAnnette MvdE\n\n\tDesign Assets\n\n\tFirst idea Prototype\n\n\tMagic Patterns Project\n\n\tMarc\n\n\tExploration Prototype\n\n\thttps://www.magicpatterns.com/c/snrle459ny2nbifqud45sw\n\n\tAnnette MvdE\n\n\tMVP\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tShay Obaidullah\n\n\tDesign Assets\n\n\tFlow charts\n\n\tMiro\n\nPassword: InfluencerMarketplace2025\n\n\n\n\n\nFigma\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAnnette MvdE\n\n\tResearch\n\n\tUser Research Plan & Assets\n\n\tIXI Research Plan: Influencer Marketplace\n\n\tKatheryn Eckles\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\nStakeholder Landscape (DACI)\n\nRole\n\n\tDepartment\n\n\tContact\n\n\tRituals\n\n\tSponsor\n\n\tSLT\n\n\tEd Boyes\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDriver\n\n\tCommunication #influencer-marketplace-driver\n\n\tWeekly  + async slack update\n\n\tExperience Strategy\n\n\tAnnette MvdE (Berlin: GMT+2)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBusiness Strategy\n\n\tMelanie Schwindt (Toronto: GMT-4)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTech Execution\n\n\tWanderley Teixeira (Toronto: GMT-4)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOperation Strategy\n\n\tMelanie Schwindt (Toronto: GMT-4)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tApprover\n\n\tCommunication #influencer-marketplace-stakeholder\n\n\tBi-weekly: Gated Decision end of sprint with 60-minute presentation of validated work, key risks, and GO/NO-GO approval to proceed to the next phase + async slack update\n\n\tKey Approver\n\n\tIan Brooks (Toronto: GMT-4)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tExperience Strategy\n\n\tMarc (Berlin: GMT+2) //  OOO sprint 1+2\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBusiness Strategy\n\n\tLinnea Siersma (Toronto: GMT-4)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTech Execution\n\n\tSameer Doda (Toronto: GMT-4)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOperation Strategy\n\n\tInterim: Linnea Siersma (Toronto: GMT-4))\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tContributors\n\n\tExperience Strategy\n\nand Research\n\n\tKatheryn Eckles (Boulder: GMT-6)  // OOO Sprint 1\n\n* Andrea Henry Interim as consulting partner\n\n\tDaily if needed or async for internal Alignment (15-minute Standup to surface blockers and coordinate handoffs)\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly\n\n30-60-min Critique session to review prototype, resolve design conflicts, and ensure the roadmap is viable for the next week.\n\n\tMarketing/Content\n\n\t* Partnership: Sam Evans\n\n* GCI: Joanna Lindenberg\n\n* Marketing: Bart Molenda\n\n* Content Design: Alison McMenemy \n\n* Marketing counterpart: tbd\n\n\tBusiness Strategy\n\n\tAlice Canty tbd\n\n\tTech Execution\n\n\tNikita Gorshkov (Berlin)\n\nProduct Designer: Shay Obaidullah \n\n\tOperation Strategy\n\n\tAlice Canty tbd\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tGrowth Marketing CA\n\n\tPlanning marketing campaign with influencers in 2026\n\nCole Banning\n\nJames Griesser\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tInformed\n\n\tCommunication #influencer-marketplace-stakeholder\n\n\tAsync slack updates for now\n\n\tEngineering\n\n\t* Leo Lee (Ontario)\n\n* Engineering Team tbd\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tStrategy\n\n\t* Todd Diemer (Berlin)\n\n\tDesign\n\n\t* David Sternberg  (Toronto: GMT-4)\n\n* Marlene Rosner (Berlin)\n\n\tMarketing/ Research/ \n\nContent\n\n\t* Brand/Marketing \n\n   * Sam Evans \n\n   * Marina Kramer\n\n   * Nicolas Arias leaving HF > Yaroslav Dronov\n\n \n\n* Content Design: Christie Fremon\n\n\tOperations/SKUs\n\n\t* Up stream\n\n   * Georgiana Ciobotaru ?\n\n* Down stream:\n\n   * Danielle Boucher ?\n\n\tLegal\n\n\ttbd\n\n\tOther Teams\n\n\tProject DAU: Lisa Trueblood, Luigi Frettoloso, Lexy Martin\n\n\tOrganic Growth\n\n\tSrishti Shah \n\n\tCreators\n\n\tBryan Altman reach out for support on influencer reach-out\n\n\t\n\n\n\n👏 Initiatives in other teams\n\nOther teams\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are current parallel initiatives in other teams that could inform us on our research and mvp development.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing Team: HF Canada\n\n* Background: They’ve been trying to use static recipe slots to allow marketing to better storytell about specific recipes - and thereby drive acquisition. The iteration of this idea is the marketing campaign with influencers. Given the upcoming Influencer Marketplace test for Canada, they thought this would be worth trying as an MVP, to understand how it works and what we can learn before the larger infrastructure is completed.\n\n* What: Marketing campaign for 2026, a view Influencers will feature pre-developed recipes on the HelloFresh menu to drive traffic to our sign up page in Canada. Expect we'll start with testing 1 or 2 influencers.\n\n* Who: Cole Banning James Griesser\n\n* How it could interleave: \n\nIt’s similar to our idea but not the same, since they won't have a storefront. We can collect data for inform our business plan.\n\n   * Call with Cole and Nikita, 10.11.2025\n\n   * Projects run separately since they are different from technical execution\n\n   * We will inform each other on progress and reach out to influencer\n\n   * Bryan Altman was responsible for North America, now he is responsible for US only, so Cole does North America\n\n\n\n\n\nProject DAU\n\n   * What: Cookbook Lib on the Hellofresh Platform for actives and prospects\n\n   * Team: Lisa TruebloodMatin Lashkari Lexy Martin Luigi Frettoloso \n\n   * How it could interleave: \n\nNikita/ Shrishti Oct 24, 2025 : The feature Lisa and her team are working on allows saving an influencer/creator’s recipe from social media on the app. When a creator’s recipe is saved X number of times, we can potentially reach out to them. They’re also building a tool that automatically converts a creator’s recipe into the HelloFresh recipe format. I think this code could be reused — for example, an influencer could input their recipe, and it would be converted into the HF format directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Matching Feature\n\n\n\n      * What: AI matching algorithm that helps local culinary teams identify which recipes they’re missing compared to other markets, and which SKUs are locally procurable.\n\n      * Team: Imran Uddin (Food System)\n\n      * How it could interleave: \n\n Nikita/ Shrishti Oct 24, 2025\n\nImran’s team is developing an AI matching algorithm that helps local culinary teams identify which recipes they’re missing compared to other markets, and which SKUs are locally procurable. I’ll be collaborating with them, and I see potential to reuse parts of this code as well (though not entirely sure yet).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEO /GEO\n\n         * What: On the SEO side, we’ve already built a system (I’m adding the links) for recipe development pages.\n\n         * Team:  ???\n\n         * How it could interleave: \n\nNikita/ Shrishti Oct 24, 2025\n\nOn the SEO side, we’ve already built a system (I’m adding the links) for recipe development pages. I see an opportunity to create a similar setup for influencers — either a dedicated influencer section or individual influencer pages that could attract organic traffic. Additionally, we could feature influencers directly on recipe pages. That way, if someone searches for “Recipe X + Influencer Name,” our pages could surface in search results.\n\n🏃 Roadmap\n\nRoadmap: Sprints & Updates\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Updated: Nov 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n10-week Roadmap\n\nMain Project Driver: Annette MvdE (Strategy) and Katheryn Eckles (Research)\n\n\n\n\n\nSprints (2-week sprints)\n\n\tActivities\n\n\tResearch: Influencer\n\n\tResearch: Customer\n\n\tDeliverables\n\n\tTeam Reviews\n\n\tSprint 0\n\nOct 13, 2025– Oct 24, 2025\n\n\tDiscovery Focus: Understanding & Framing\n\n            * Identify stakeholders, and constraints\n\n            * Understand vision and why\n\n            * Ways of working with Katie, Canada\n\n            * Interview Stakeholders\n\n\n\nKick-off Workshop\n\n               * Define problem, vision, success metrics, North Star\n\n               * Align on ways of working\n\n               * Risk mapping\n\n               * Roles & Responsibilities\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch\n\n               * Execute first studies of undermoderated tests with prospects and actives\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPrep Discussion guide and setup survey via user testing and sprig\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyze first insights\n\n\t               * Research Plan for first signals\n\n               * Outcomes Kick-off WS\n\n               * Study Report\n\n               * Roadmap\n\n               * Sprint 1 Plan\n\n               * Setup Rituals for critiques and review\n\n\t               * Involved team via slack\n\n               * Kick-Off workshop\n\n\tSprint 1\n\nOct 27, 2025–Nov 7, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnette 2 weeks sickness\n\nKatie 2 weeks OOO\n\n\n\n\n\n\t               1.

Marketplace Catchup - 2025/12/02 11:57 EST - Notes by Gemini\n\n\n\n\n\nThe discussion primarily focuses on the strategy and immediate next steps for the Influencer Marketplace MVP (Minimum Viable Product), with an emphasis on product development flow, technical implementation, and influencer management/research.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. MVP Strategy & Product Development Flow\n\nPoint\n\n\tOwner/Follow-up\n\n\tSummary\n\n\tDecision/Action\n\n\tStakeholder Communication Strategy\n\n\tSameer \n\n(Action: Create initial starting point for discussion)\n\n\tPrevious approaches of showing high-fidelity screens early led stakeholders to focus on visuals (e.g., \"this button looks ugly\") instead of the core customer journey/promise.\n\n\tDecision: \n\n                                          * Future discussions will focus on customer journey alignment first. \n\n                                          * Low/high-fidelity screens will only be shown after the customer journey is agreed upon and backed by research.\n\n\tMVP Focus\n\n\tSameer \n\n(Action: Define MVP scope for the platform)\n\n\tDetermine the scope of the MVP to ensure a focused effort and quick build.\n\n\tDecision: \n\n                                          * The MVP will be consumer-facing and managed (HelloFresh creates everything for the influencers). Scaling the supply side (open platform) will happen after proving the business case with consumers.\n\n\tProduct Requirements Document (PRD)\n\n\tAnnette\n\nSameer needs input and help from Annette/team\n\n\tNeed to formalize requirements to start building.\n\n\tThe PRD will be generated once the customer journey is aligned and all decisions are backed by existing research, including rationale \n\n\n\n(“So and you know why we are taking some decisions, what is the rationale behind it and which is where you know I need a lot of input and help. So we do that and that would give us our product requirements document for us to start building on it.”)\n\n\tExisting \"Cookbook\" Tool Integration\n\n\tSameer/Annette (Investigate feasibility)\n\n\tThe DAU team has built a tool that converts video URLs into HelloFresh recipe cards (ingredients/steps).\n\n\tDecision/Action: \n\n                                          * Explore using the same code/tool for the Influencer Marketplace MVP to significantly reduce manual effort for recipe creation from influencer videos.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Technical Implementation & Platform\n\nPoint\n\n\tSummary\n\n\tDecision/Action\n\n\tRationale/Context\n\n\tPlatform Choice (Internal vs. Shopify)\n\n\tDiscussed whether to build the consumer-facing store (similar to the Christmas Box) on Shopify or internally.\n\n\tDecision: Lean on building internally using existing HelloFresh components/platform.\n\n\tShopify setup is complex. Internal build allows for a small, defined MVP scope and reuse of existing Christmas Box code.\n\n\tChristmas Box Platform Limitations\n\n\tThe existing Christmas Box store (built by Sameer) has back-end limitations: only one box per order flow, complex recipe configuration, no add-on purchases, and no voucher capability.\n\n\tAction/Context: The team (Do and others) are already working to solve these limitations in Q1. If solved, the front-end can be reused and quickly tweaked for the Influencer Marketplace.\n\n\tFamiliarity with the existing front-end (created by Sameer/Vander) makes quick adjustments possible.\n\n\tCreator-Side Tools (Future Scalability)\n\n\tDiscussed tools needed for an unmanaged, scalable marketplace (post-MVP).\n\n\tTools needed include: Automated recipe card creation from video, Costing mechanism exposure for influencers to understand product cost, and Analytics/Trends dashboards (like Shopify) for content inspiration and performance tracking.\n\n\tThis is important for the long-term vision to move from a managed to an unmanaged, true two-way marketplace.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Influencer Management & Research Concerns\n\n\n\n\n\nPoint\n\n\tSummary\n\n\tDecision/Action\n\n\tContext/Learning\n\n\tIngredient & Fulfillment Limitations\n\n\tConcern about whether HelloFresh can fulfill the unique/non-standard ingredients influencers use (e.g., specific spices, products).\n\n\tAction: Sameer needs to speak with the physical product team to understand their capability to create or source new ingredients/spice mixes.\n\n\tInfluencers are highly concerned about the quality and specific ingredients matching their videos.\n\n\tInfluencer Recipe Adaptation\n\n\tWill influencers be willing to change their recipes/videos to fit HelloFresh's standard assortment?\n\n\tFinding (from Research): Influencers are more likely to create specific new dishes for the marketplace, based on what they know HelloFresh can fulfill or what consumers are searching for (using analytics/trends data).\n\n\tThis avoids having to recut existing video content to match ingredient swaps. They want to see the assortment early in onboarding.\n\n\tMarketing and Legal\n\n\tNeed to outreach to specific influencers, and legal needs to create contracts for the MVP phase.\n\n\tAction: Sameer will sync with the local HelloFresh Canada marketing team (and potentially Col Banning) to drive the influencer recruitment and contract process.\n\n\tA nice platform is useless if no influencers are there (\"if nobody's there, it's a problem\").\n\n\tResearch Handover & Next Steps\n\n\tDiscussed the transfer of knowledge from the current research team (Annette/Katy) to the product team (Sameer).\n\n\tDecision: Sameer wants the team to continue working together (even with occasional conversations) because key learnings and context are often missed in formal documentation.\n\n\tThe team is concentrating on the creator view as it is completely new territory compared to the standard transactional consumer view.\n\n\t\n\n\n\nOpen tasks for MVP\n\nOpen tasks for MVP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Annette MvdE\n\nLast updated: Dec 3, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\n\tTask\n\n\tResponsibility\n\n\tInformed by\n\n\tDeadline\n\n\tHandover Research\n\n\t                                          * Actionable Recommendations for the vision \n\n                                          * All decisions for the MVP Customer User Journey are backed up from Research for the PRD (Product Requirement Document) \n\n\tAnnette/ Katie\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEnd Jan\n\n\tUser Journey & UX\n\n\t                                          * User Journey Map\n\n                                          * UI Screens\n\n\tShay\n\n\tAnnette/ Katie\n\n\tEnd of year\n\n\tSystem & Backend\n\n\t                                          * Own system vs. bought (Shopify)\n\n                                          * Re-useable code for future MVPs depending on feature\n\n\tSameer\n\n\tDAU Team\n\nFood System\n\n…?\n\n\tEnd of year\n\n\tOperations\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMelanie\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\ttbd\n\n\tInfluencer Recruitment\n\n\t                                          * Recruit X Influencers\n\n                                          * Include legal for contract creation\n\n\tCole Banning/ \n\nMarina Kramer?\n\n\tIan/ Jama\n\n\ttbd\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMVP 1\n\n\tMVP Iterations\n\n\tVision\n\n\tConsumer\n\n\tSee Social Media Post/Reel from Creator with redirect link\n\n\n\n\n\nLand on:\n\n                                          * MP Landing page from creator\n\n                                          * Or Recipe\n\n\n\n\n\nOptions:\n\n                                          * Explore other recipes\n\n                                          * Purchase via OTP\n\n                                          * Create an account\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCreator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tProviding us their recipe\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTech & Operations\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\nDiscussion Guide\n\nDiscussion Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding what creators are looking for in a marketplace, and how we might facilitate the service for them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\nWe want to have semi-structured interviews with prospective B2B partners in the US, in order to understand how our concepts fit their \n\n\n\n\n\n🔎  Main methodology\n\n\tRemote Concept Discussion\n\n\t👩🏽 Number of Responses\n\n\ttbd\n\n\t📋 Screening Criteria\n\n\ttbd\n\n\t🌎 Market\n\n\tUS/ CA\n\n\t📱  Format\n\n\tRemote\n\n\t⏳Timeline \n\n\tWeek 50/51\n\n\t🛠 Materials \n\n\tScript below\n\n\t💰 Incentives\n\n\ttbd\n\n\t📱 Prototype\n\n\tFigma\n\nMiroboard\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Questions [Draft !]\n\n\n\n                                          1.

Demand for Data and Analytics\n\n                                                                                                                                 * Strong desire for more visibility into search term data (\"creator search insights\"), top-selling recipes, conversion rates, and quality feedback (scores/ratings).\n\n\tFeature Development: The platform needs to provide robust data and analytics tools to help creators adapt their recipes and content.\n\n\tAnnette MvdE\n\nTech team\n\n\tIII.

While not always stated directly, their struggle to identify trends and understand audience interest suggests a need for clearer, data-driven guidance. \n\nAccess to metrics like top-selling recipes, conversion rates, and quality feedback would help them make more informed decisions about what to create next.\n\n\t                                                                                                                                          * Develop a creator-facing analytics dashboard that highlights trending content, best-performing recipes, and user engagement insights, similar to TikTok’s Creator Search Insights.

                                                                                                                     * recipe creators to use HF’s operational system to create and sell meal kits independently and promote them via social media channels in order to use a new revenue stream and connect with their followers\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                         * Prospects, to purchase recipes from their favourite influencers as meal kits with high quality ingredients, next day delivery to their home with OTP, to being able to cook them easily\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                         * HF Actives, to purchase recipes from different food influencers in their weekly subscriptions that strengthens their value and variety perception in the service\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main difference we see between the MVP (left) and the bigger vision (right) is the level of control: \n\n

the recipes quality before making them purchasable\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                            * An iteration could mean more control: testing a ‘HF vetted’ stamp feature, where many influencers can create their recipes, some might be vetted, others not\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                            * Towards an open marketplace: where everyone can create recipes but we need to make sure to bring some kind of quality insurance (vetted/review based quality check, …)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: What is our major goal?\n\nDo we actually need a standalone vertical to unlock this new monetization opportunity, or can we achieve similar outcomes, highly personalized content, new revenue streams, creator partnerships within or adjacent to our

I’d like to keep both tracks alive in this first sprint, but with a slightly different approach while Katie (Researcher) is out.\n\nI’ll focus on:\n\n                                                                                                                                                                     * Building early prototypes for both tracks using magic patterns and quick concept sketches\n\n                                                                                                                                                                     * Doing secondary research and a competitor scan to inform those directions\n\n                                                                                                                                                                     * and sharing short video walkthroughs of each concept so everyone can easily review and comment asynchronously across time zones\n\nThis approach helps us make fast, visible progress, collect more concrete hypotheses for our discovery backlog and be in a great position to move into structured research and prototype evaluation once Katie is back in Sprint 2.\n\nIf that direction sounds good, I’ll move ahead with setting up the Miro boards and async feedback loop.\n\nThanks all, looking forward to getting these early prototypes out there!\n\nResponses:\n\n                                                                                                                                                                     * Both Jama and Ian are aligned with this approach\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

The key to a successful Influencer Marketplace lies in navigating consumer trust, which is based on authenticity and relatability (not just expertise). Major barriers include the perceived lack of professionalism (minimal recipe testing), deep skepticism of paid sponsorships, and the dominant fear of recipe failure (inaccuracy, bad taste, or impracticality). The strategy must therefore focus on prioritizing micro/nano-influencers, offering valuable \"edutainment,\" implementing robust quality control and vetting, and actively building trust in the social commerce aspects to ensure reliable transactions.\n\n\n\nEvidence:\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1.

Authenticity vs. authority:\n\nMany people do like recipe-creator influencers, especially for inspiration, fun, and getting new ideas. But the level of trust is conditional: it depends on perceived authenticity, practicality, and how much the creator is “for content” versus “for cooking.”  [see 2ndary research tab]\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1. Influencers = relatable trust; Traditional sources = expert trust. \n\nFood influencers are often trusted for their authenticity, they feel relatable, like “someone like me.” Followers believe influencers genuinely test products or recipes in real life. Traditional cooking sources (e.g., chefs, food magazines) are trusted for their authority, expertise, training, or editorial credibility. Audiences favor creators who are genuine, relatable, and skilled. \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                           2.

Sponsorship vs. Genuineness: High skepticism toward direct brand communication and traditional celebrity endorsements. Consumers are fatigued by an increase in sponsored content.

While friction is a barrier and ease is an appeal, the direct correlation between emotional connection to the influencer and the final decision to purchase the kit is not clearly proven over, say, just novelty or convenience.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Price / Value:\n\nPurchase decision is highly dependent on: 1) Perceived value of the service, 2) Relationship to their influencer, and 3) Competitive price towards Instacart-like services with a one-time purchase.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Remaining Gap:  Specifics on pricing are missing. What is the perceived price ceiling for a single-purchase kit? Is it closer to Instacart's grocery cost + fee, or a HelloFresh meal kit price? How do customers explicitly value the influencer relationship in monetary terms (e.g., are they willing to pay a $5 premium to support them)? No mention of Instacart-like services or comparison to them. \"Would you pay a $X premium for this kit because it's from your favorite creator?\"\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Prospects experience: \n\nSocial media users want a friction-free, single-click checkout and ordering process (e.g., a \"Cook This with HelloFresh\" button) directly from the external recipe page, because their impulse is high, but their motivation to manually search/sign up/build a box is low.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Remaining gap: No direct confirmation of the \"Cook This with HelloFresh\" button concept. While the need for ease is proven, the specific utility of a direct external link versus an in-app purchase (like TikTok Shop) is not explicitly contrasted for food. The compliance evidence shows platforms deprioritize external links (Meta), which contradicts the feasibility of the proposed touchpoint.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Interest in Solution: \n\nHelloFresh Active customers will only adopt influencer recipes if they perceive a significant incremental value (e.g., novelty (variety), aspiration, supporting a creator) that justifies a potential premium or difference in complexity.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           * Remaining gap:  The \"only adopt\" condition remains a major gap. The insights confirm interest but do not confirm that the incremental value must justify a premium.

‘fulfillment and logistics’ bridge between Influencer and Followers that the influencers' inspiration (recipe) becomes a real shoppable, cookable meal kit for the consumers to order to their homes.\n\nWe see the urgency to act now, because influencers are already trying to solve this problem by building solutions themselves via Instacart or partnering up. \n\n\n\n\n\nHelloFresh needs to figure out what kind of shoppable influencer program is currently working in the market, how to build it to attract both influencers and customers, and what the competitive and financial risks/opportunities are.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeliverables\n\n\n\n\n\n

For example: “source credibility … in the case of a digital influencer, as the perceived expertise, trustworthiness, and attractiveness …” \n\n\n\n\n\nInfluencer Credibility & Purchase Intention:\n\n The study finds that digital influencers on Instagram positively affect consumers’ healthy food purchase intentions, primarily through their credibility (trustworthiness, expertise, and attractiveness).\n\n\n\nConsumer Involvement & Attitudes:\n\n Consumers’ involvement with healthy food and their positive attitudes toward advertising also enhance purchase intention.  Higher involvement with Instagram strengthens influencer credibility and reduces advertising avoidance.\n\n\n\nAdvertising Avoidance & Engagement:\n\n Both advertising avoidance and engagement with healthy food significantly influence attitudes toward Instagram ads, which in turn boost purchase intentions.\n\n\n\nModel Contribution:\n\n The study develops a comprehensive model combining the Theory of Source Credibility (TSC) and the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM)—an uncommon but effective integration in influencer marketing research.

In this work, we classified influencers into celebrity and noncelebrity groups and analyzed how they affect consumers' purchase intention. We also analyzed how psychological variables, such as regulatory focus and perceived authenticity affect this process. We conducted three studies with consumers in China, South Korea, and the United States who participated in each between‐subjects experiment.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * The results showed that people have higher purchase intention for products recommended by noncelebrity influencers than those recommended by celebrity influencers. \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * We also found that regulatory focus moderates the relationship between the influencer type and consumers' purchase intention.

The results of this study provide effective marketing strategies and implications for companies when they use influencers as a tool for marketing activities.\n\n\t\n\n\n\nWhat are customer pains and concerns around food influencers?\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall: many people do like recipe-creator influencers, especially for inspiration, fun, and getting new ideas. But the level of trust is conditional: it depends on perceived authenticity, practicality, and how much the creator is “for content” versus “for cooking.”\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Authenticity concerns\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * On Reddit, people frequently raise doubts about how genuine recipe creators are, particularly when brand sponsorships are involved. \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * For example: “Part of me wonders if they genuinely love these products or if it’s all sponsored content disguised as authentic cooking.”\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Consumers aren’t just looking for a recipe for inspiration, they’re looking for people they trust to guide their decisions around what they eat, where they shop, and how they feel.

Assessing the Influencer's Credibility and Authority\n\nTrust begins with the perception of the content creator's knowledge and authority, particularly regarding food expertise.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1. Expertise and Competence: The perceived level of a food influencer's expertise has a positive impact on followers' consumer behavior,. The credibility and perceived competence of influencers play a pivotal role in engendering trust, subsequently impacting purchasing behavior and influencing consumption decisions,. Followers specifically look for FEIs who are regarded as experts, have experience in the concept of food, and show a good understanding of food.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   2. Shared Identity and Aspiration: Influencers often serve as a reference group. Consumers may be persuaded by influencers of the same gender due to social identity theories,. Furthermore, an FEI's attractive lifestyle, beauty, and sex appeal can exert considerable influence on consumer behavior. This is based on the idea that followers aspire to emulate the influencer's image and lifestyle,, and attractive individuals may receive more favorable attributions, including trustworthiness and expertise (the halo effect theory).\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   3. Social Validation (Follower Count): The number of followers an influencer has also positively correlates with consumer behavior,. This reinforces the concept of social proof, suggesting that people tend to emulate behaviors adopted by a large number of others, implying that if many people follow an influencer, they must be reliable.\n\nII. Assessing the Recipe and Content Quality\n\nFor a recipe to be considered \"great\" or trustworthy, users prioritize practical usability, clarity, and community validation.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1. Practicality and Usability: Users actively assess the feasibility of the recipes by checking the ingredients and the ease of the recipe. They are looking for meals that are quick and easy to make, and they value clear information on leftovers, making it ahead of time, or meeting specific health goals. The perceived ease of the recipe positively relates to a user's self-efficacy—their belief that they can successfully make the dish.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   2. Clarity and Format: Recipes are trusted when they are presented clearly and concisely. A major pain point for users is encountering recipes that include a \"novel\" or ten paragraphs about a blogger’s personal life before reaching the ingredient list. Users highly prefer:\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Videos and Visuals: Videos are preferred because users can follow along, pause, and rewind,. Seeing the process makes the final product feel more attainable than static images, and seeing the actions in sequence provides helpful tips,.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Actionable Advice: Users prefer content that gives very little information, focusing instead on practical advice like adjustments for doubling a recipe or how to store and reheat leftovers.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   3. Community and Social Proof (The Gold Standard): One of the most critical ways users vet content is by relying on the community of people who have already tried the recipe.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Users check the comments and ratings to see what people who have made the social media recipe say,,.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Comments and reviews are often viewed as a \"gold mine\" because they provide helpful tips, tricks, and modifications that can improve a recipe,.\n\nIn short, to trust a food influencer, the sources suggest that you should look for evidence of documented expertise (not just aesthetic appeal), but most importantly, you should prioritize practical, easy-to-follow content validated by a strong community, as proven through numerous positive reviews and helpful modification comments,,.\n\nYou can think of trusting a food influencer as similar to hiring a home contractor: you assess their certifications and experience (expertise), you check their portfolio and how good their previous jobs look (aesthetic/lifestyle), but the ultimate deciders are the reviews from previous customers (comments/social proof) who can confirm the job was easy, clear, and successful,.\n\n\n\n\n\nActionable steps:\n\n\n\n\n\nActionable steps\n\n\t1.

TikTok is essential for trend-jacking, reach, and authenticity/spontaneity. YouTube drives in-depth tutorials, long-form reviews, and higher conversion rates due to trust/authority.\n\n\tThe Marketplace must support multi-platform campaigns with differentiated content requirements. Creator profiles need to clearly detail expertise across these three platforms.\n\n\tCreator Monetization\n\n\tCreators prioritize platforms that offer the best direct monetization tools (e.g., YouTube ad revenue split, TikTok Creator Fund access) and ease of brand collaboration. Consistency in payment and clear briefs are highly valued.\n\n\tOur platform needs to streamline the briefing, contracting, and payment process, making it significantly easier than direct negotiations or other platforms.\n\n\tContent Vertical (Food/Culinary)\n\n\tAuthenticity and relatability (e.g., home cooking, grocery hauls, quick meal prep) significantly outperform highly-produced, inaccessible content. The audience seeks actionable tips and ingredients/product recommendations.\n\n\tThe Marketplace must facilitate campaigns centered on product integration (ingredients, appliances, delivery services) and 'recipe testing' collaborations rather than just generic brand promotion.\n\n\tPartnership Success\n\n\tCampaigns that give creators creative freedom within defined guardrails tend to perform better than overly restrictive ones. Clear communication of why a product fits the creator's niche is vital for internal buy-in and genuine promotion.\n\n\tBriefs must focus on campaign objectives and mandatory elements, leaving room for creator personality. Vetting creators based on true niche relevance (not just follower count) is critical.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow food influencer build, engage, earn\n\nHow food influencers build, engage and earn\n\nFrom Katheryn Eckles\n\nRelationship & engagement with followers (what “works”)\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Authenticity and usefulness drive trust and purchase intent; consumers increasingly trust creators’ guidance and want human-centered, original content.(sr, sr)\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Community > virality (especially in food).

Trendy, aesthetic, or “food-as-entertainment” content earns discovery and cultural relevance; then creators channel that attention to cookable formats (blog posts with schema, shoppable lists, printable cards, paid meal plans).

Payment can be a set fee, commission, or even free products (which can trigger tax implications in Germany).\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiliate marketing\n\nYou promote a product or service using a unique link or discount code. You earn a commission whenever your followers make a purchase using your link. This is common in niches like fashion, beauty, and tech. It’s an attractive option for smaller influencers, as you don’t need a massive following to start earning.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelling your products\n\nSome influencers develop and sell physical or digital products (e.g., eBooks, merchandise, or courses). Instagram provides tools like Instagram Shopping to tag products in posts, making it easy for followers to purchase directly.\n\n\n\n\n\nServices (e.g., consulting, caption writing, or photography)\n\nPlenty of freelancers in Germany use Instagram to market their services. This could be anything from lifestyle photography to social media consulting. You showcase your portfolio on Instagram and land freelance gigs through your profile.\n\n\n\n\n\nDropshipping\n\nIn the dropshipping model, you sell products online without holding inventory. Your supplier handles the storage and shipping, and you focus on marketing the items on Instagram. Remember that in Germany, if you run a dropshipping business, you generally need a registered trade license (Gewerbeanmeldung) and must adhere to specific tax obligations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompensation TikTok\n\n\n\n\n\nCompensation Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\nInfluencer Marketing Challenges & Trends\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying Quality Influencers
