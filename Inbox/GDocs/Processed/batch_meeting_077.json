Tobias and Solenne presented this roadmap to Yoav and Annie and received good feedback about it. In the second tab of the spreadsheet we listed the priorities, with Porterhouse leading the list. Whenever we have to make a hard choice between two deliveries, we will decide for the one with the higher priority. That makes projects with lower priority more likely to be delayed than the ones with higher priority. If you have any concern of a high-priority project, please let Tobias and Solenne know as soon as possible.\n\n💻 Tech Initiatives\n\n                                                                                                                                    * The BFF migration in the mobile app is almost almost almost complete. We can expect the initiative to be complete early next week. There are still some cleaning up to do on web and mobile.\n\n                                                                                                                                    * Last week we implemented a proof of concept of how we can migrate route access control to react components, and this we started with the migration of the access control function for the Cancellation page. By the end of next week, we should have also migrated the Delivery Tracking and RaF routes.\n\n💸 Additional Vouchers\n\nOne of Engagement's sprint goals is to support Additional Vouchers in our price calculation logic for web and mobile. This week we started working on the website, refactoring the voucher Redux logic (🍝) and implementing the action to fetch a subscription's additional voucher info.\n\n🔪 Killing Alice\n\nThis week we removed the last API call to Alice: update payment method in web. Before Alice is really killed in Intfood (expected mid April), we will need to do a force update of our mobile app to prevent users from using old versions that are still using the old endpoints.\n\n🛒 Add-ons\n\nThe Happiness team started to implement some changes for Add-Ons, and was able to setup some add-ons SKUs in staging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n—\n\nPrevious Notes Location: https://www.notion.so/New-Brands-Retention-Weekly-Notes-c227bcddd153472f841114c2603de18d",

Tobias and Solenne presented this roadmap to Yoav and Annie and received good feedback about it. In the second tab of the spreadsheet we listed the priorities, with Porterhouse leading the list. Whenever we have to make a hard choice between two deliveries, we will decide for the one with the higher priority. That makes projects with lower priority more likely to be delayed than the ones with higher priority. If you have any concern of a high-priority project, please let Tobias and Solenne know as soon as possible.\n\n💻 Tech Initiatives\n\n                                                                                                                                    * The BFF migration in the mobile app is almost almost almost complete. We can expect the initiative to be complete early next week. There are still some cleaning up to do on web and mobile.\n\n                                                                                                                                    * Last week we implemented a proof of concept of how we can migrate route access control to react components, and this we started with the migration of the access control function for the Cancellation page. By the end of next week, we should have also migrated the Delivery Tracking and RaF routes.\n\n💸 Additional Vouchers\n\nOne of Engagement's sprint goals is to support Additional Vouchers in our price calculation logic for web and mobile. This week we started working on the website, refactoring the voucher Redux logic (🍝) and implementing the action to fetch a subscription's additional voucher info.\n\n🔪 Killing Alice\n\nThis week we removed the last API call to Alice: update payment method in web. Before Alice is really killed in Intfood (expected mid April), we will need to do a force update of our mobile app to prevent users from using old versions that are still using the old endpoints.\n\n🛒 Add-ons\n\nThe Happiness team started to implement some changes for Add-Ons, and was able to setup some add-ons SKUs in staging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n—\n\nPrevious Notes Location: https://www.notion.so/New-Brands-Retention-Weekly-Notes-c227bcddd153472f841114c2603de18d",
