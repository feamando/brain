Business Problem and Feature Overview\n\nHelloFresh Group is addressing key challenges in its business by introducing One-Time-Purchase (OTP) capabilities, moving beyond its traditional subscription-only model. The company recognizes that limited purchasing flexibility has deterred potential new customers and past subscribers who are hesitant about long-term commitments. Furthermore, existing methods for one-off sales, such as those for seasonal boxes, have often relied on separate microsites or legacy internal systems, leading to a fragmented customer experience, operational inefficiencies, and increased costs. This new OTP initiative aims to streamline these processes and capture a wider market by offering greater flexibility, enabling new opportunities like cross-selling Factor meals, integrating Good Chop offerings, and supporting a future two-way marketplace, all while providing a more seamless and intuitive experience for both new and existing customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe core of the proposed solution involves creating a unified OTP user flow across HelloFresh Group brands, complete with transparent pricing, distinct cart and checkout processes, and integrated order management for all customer types. Key functionalities to be built include robust SKU management, differentiated menu configurations, automated order confirmations and tracking, and comprehensive backend integration for operations, logistics, and financial reporting. This strategic shift is projected to unlock significant incremental revenue, with estimates ranging from €24.7M to €28.8M in Total Customer Value Added (TCVA), driven by seasonal boxes[a][b] and Good Chop OTP experiments, as well as an anticipated increase in Average Order Value (AOV) from Factor cross-selling.

This helps analytics and (if needed) data teams understand the details of the problem and evaluate if the existing data assets are sufficient to address the problem or do we need more data. \n\n1. Business Problem and Feature Overview\n\nHelloFresh Group is addressing key challenges in its business by introducing One-Time-Purchase (OTP) capabilities, moving beyond its traditional subscription-only model. The company recognizes that limited purchasing flexibility has deterred potential new customers and past subscribers who are hesitant about long-term commitments. Furthermore, existing methods for one-off sales, such as those for seasonal boxes, have often relied on separate microsites or legacy internal systems, leading to a fragmented customer experience, operational inefficiencies, and increased costs. This new OTP initiative aims to streamline these processes and capture a wider market by offering greater flexibility, enabling new opportunities like cross-selling Factor meals, integrating Good Chop offerings, and supporting a future two-way marketplace, all while providing a more seamless and intuitive experience for both new and existing customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe core of the proposed solution involves creating a unified OTP user flow across HelloFresh Group brands, complete with transparent pricing, distinct cart and checkout processes, and integrated order management for all customer types. Key functionalities to be built include robust SKU management, differentiated menu configurations, automated order confirmations and tracking, and comprehensive backend integration for operations, logistics, and financial reporting. This strategic shift is projected to unlock significant incremental revenue, with estimates ranging from €24.7M to €28.8M in Total Customer Value Added (TCVA), driven by seasonal boxes[a][b] and Good Chop OTP experiments, as well as an anticipated increase in Average Order Value (AOV) from Factor cross-selling. The initiative also focuses on enhancing customer care support for OTP orders[c] and improving data analytics capabilities to monitor performance effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nRefer to this doc for product requirements: PRD: Enabling One-Time-Purchase (OTP) Capabilities for HelloFresh Group\n\nTechnical Implementation plan: OTP Proposal\n\n2025 OKRs\n\n\n\n\n\nPACO-NV-5 : Profitably scale Good Chop marketing spend towards $180m ARR by EY 2025\n\n\tNew Ventures GoC: Drive a cumulative 19% experiment/rollout-driven assumed Gross CR improvements via experiments and rollouts in 2025 for Good Chop\n\n\tPACO-RTE-4 : Audience Expansion: New Product segments + Distribution Channels\n\n\tVMS: Drive towards achieving 15,690 net conversions for Factor Form by the end of 2025, in alignment with the 2025 business plan.\n\n\t\n\n\n\nUser types:[d][e]\n\nWith OTP, we will need to consider different user-subscription types.\n\n\n\n\n\nType\n\n\tDescription\n\n\tLogic (Data Alliance)[f][g][h][i]\n\n\tProspect-user[j][k]\n\n\tVisitor that lands on landing page\n\n\tCustomer Table \n\nReco\n\n\n\n[bn]Hi @ferran.punet@hellofresh.com kind reminder to complete the review the otp success metrics.

Who is the primary customer?  \n\nFactor Form prospective customers who are interested in trying out the products but not interested in committing to a subscription for various reasons: \n\n* Want to trial products before committing to a subscription\n\n* Prefer purchasing supplements as needed rather than on a recurring basis\n\n* Are hesitant about subscription commitments due to past negative experiences\n\n* Have irregular supplement consumption patterns\n\n2. What is the customer problem or opportunity? \n\nMost consumers in the US still tend to approach supplement purchases with more flexibility, buying products on an as-needed basis. Nearly half of Gen Z (49%) and more than half of Millennials (53%) buy supplements when required, 58% of Gen X and 57% of Baby Boomers. \n\n\n\nAs of today, Factor Form is only available as a subscription. As a result, we are not serving the needs of most of our target customers, or force them into a subscription only for them to cancel later on. \n\n13.3% of Factor Form customers cancel due to having excess product, another 9.4% cancel due to delivery frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. What is the solution? What is the customer experience? \n\nEvery product offered on Factor Form will be available for purchase as a subscription as well as a one-time purchase. We will position subscriptions first and offer them at a lower price, as we would like to incentivize customers to stick to the habit in order to see results from the products and stay for subsequent orders. However, one-time purchase will still be available for customers who prioritize their flexibility, albeit at a higher price.\n\n4. What is the most important customer benefit?  \n\nThe ability to buy Factor Form products without committing to a subscription or worrying about getting unwanted orders. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRD\n\n[PRD] Factor Form | One-Time Purchase Option\n\n\n\n\n\nLast updated: Jun 10, 2025\n\nAuthor: Wellney Yarra\n\nStatus: Ready for stakeholder feedback and project kick off\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: This PRD focuses on OTP for Factor Form, including more nuance and business context. For the PRD on how OTP should generally work across different brands for HelloFresh Group, refer to PRD: Enabling One-Time-Purchase (OTP) Capabilities for HelloFresh Group.\n\n\n\n\n\nContext\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor Form currently operates on a subscription-only model. This PRD outlines the requirements for introducing one-time purchase options to expand our total addressable market (TAM) and capture customers who prefer transactional purchases over recurring subscriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current subscription-only model creates barriers for potential customers who:\n\n* Want to trial products before committing to a subscription\n\n* Prefer purchasing supplements as needed rather than on a recurring basis\n\n* Are hesitant about subscription commitments due to past negative experiences\n\n* Have irregular supplement consumption patterns\n\n\n\n\n\nThis limitation reduces our market penetration and customer acquisition potential in the growing supplement market.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpportunity\n\n\n\n\n\nThe global dietary supplements market is valued at over $150 billion, with over 50% of consumers preferring one-time purchases for product trials and flexibility. By offering one-time purchases, we can:\n\n- Increase conversion rates from prospects to customers\n\n- Capture market share from competitors offering flexible purchase options\n\n- Generate incremental revenue from existing customers making additional purchases\n\n- Reduce customer acquisition friction and expand our funnel\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccess Metrics\n\n* Revenue impact: 15% increase in total Factor For\n\n\n\nnd think through what purpose the PDP serves in this case.\n\n[n]@laura.loughran@hellofresh.com\n\n_Assigned to laura.loughran@hellofresh.com_\n\n[o]NOTE: couple with increased OTP purchase price of protein to $39.99\n\n[p]requires CRM comms to active protein customers\n\n[q]Discussion with Vitalii and Ani from Benefits:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can likely do a CSV upload for discount setting\n\n\n\n\n\n- some basic setup\n\n- skus / box number / etc. can be CSV uploaded\n\n[r]re: reactivation our team can create a discount setting and campaign for CC to use for reactivations\n\n[s]expiration dates - unlimited is being phased out - specific date expiration or after attachment how many days can that exist\n\n\n\n\n\nreason: legacy campaigns with no expiration can't be managed so there's more auditability - expiration can always be updated\n\n\n\n\n\nwe should still set an expiration, e.g. 2 years, and can adjust\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nSKU based -> default -> inherited (applies when we add new products) -> so what is our migration strategy when we add new products? we need to be clear on what the use cases are and ts&cs\n\n---\n\nPOC validating our use cases so we can confirm that csv upload can do what we need\n\n[t]Action Items\n\n\n\n\n\n[ ] POC on staging -> csv upload for a 40% + 20% / 20% + 10% -> 52wks\n\n\n\n\n\n[ ] Define strategy for reactivations (CC + CRM + onsite + etc)\n\n\n\n\n\n[ ] Define strategy for new product additions (based on constraint that applied voucher won't update to new SKUs)\n\n\n\n\n\n[ ] Define SOP for voucher maintenance -> identifying customers with a lapsed voucher / updating the duration of the discount setting on a routine basis (yearly?)\n\n[u]updated with consolidated details:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1gmUgitE31-hBHjZ8fXeJB4HCEA3szf9DzdIN4aobDOQ/edit?tab=t.ie2yvqvgmh1d#heading=h.se0i2kcyzm1t\n\n[v]We might have to rethink the single vs double sub selector on greens\n\n[w]Not a huge fan of putting editable stuff in cart unless absolutely necessary as this can make the cart crowded very soon. It should mostly be a product level addition, removal and summary.\n\n[x]Update: \n\n1. we should handle bundles and single products in the same way when it comes to quick add, i.e. add a 2nd step where user selects OTP vs subscription on the product level\n\n2. we don't support changing OTP vs sub on the cart for MVP\n\n[y]IMO, anything in cart or anywhere else should also live on the PDP, which always acts as the master editor.",
