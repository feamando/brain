They  \n\ndecided that the Canadian pilot should use static content and minimal  \n\ninitial integrations, estimating that the necessary work, including URL  \n\nsetup, some infrastructure, and basic tracking, would require one product  \n\nresource and one engineering resource for about two weeks. Nikita Gorshkov  \n\nsuggested a B2B proof of concept with minimal integrations could cost less  \n\nthan $100k (USD) as a one-time charge from Anata, in addition to the  \n\n$24,000 USD annual Shopify enterprise license fee, which Ian Brooks noted  \n\nwould significantly increase the pilot cost.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested next steps\n\n\n\n\n\nNikita Gorshkov will prepare a decision tree with pros and cons to hash out  \n\nthe sequencing of the Creator platform versus the customer platform  \n\ndelivery during the January meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting records Document Notes by Gemini\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the summary section in this email helpful?\n\nNot Useful Email Useful Email\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle LLC, 1600 Ampitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA\n\n\n\nYou have received this email because meeting artifacts were initiated in  \n\nGoogle Meet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: A Task Awaits You: Job Requisition - Nikita Gorshkov\nID: 19b376995fa47e83\nFrom: \"Workday@HelloFresh\" <hellofresh@myworkday.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\n[No readable text content found]\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Firefox's manager just took over all of Mozilla\nID: 19b37646581e366c\nFrom: Mindstream <hello@mindstream.news>\n----------------------------------------\n\n----------\n\nYes, you can yo-yo in space, and NASA already tried it.\n\n\n\nBack in 2012, astronaut Don Pettit brought a yo-yo to the ISS and pulled off a whole routine in microgravity. \n\n\n\nTurns out the tricks still work because yo-yos rely on angular momentum, not “not floating away,” as long as you keep the string tight.\n\n\n\n**What’s in store:**\n\n\n\n* **The browser** wars are back and Mozilla just picked a side.\n\n\n\n* **Merriam-Webster** just named the mess.\n\n\n\n* **Mindstream Picks: **TotalEnergies signs 21-year renewable power deal.\n\n\n\n* [**Go viral**](https://offers.hubspot.com/ai-powered-meme-marketing?utm_medium=email-media-newsletter&utm_source=mindstream&utm_campaign=owned&utm_term=2025-12-19&utm_content=native-ads)** **with AI memes?\n\n\n\n_Read Time: 4 minutes_\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------\n\n###### **AI BROWSERS **\n\n\n\n## [Firefox is done being quiet](https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/16/mozilla_corporation_new_ceo/)\n\n\n\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/7545f8db-21f4-4162-8440-646821768667/mindstreammg_Create_a_digital_illustration_in_a_clean_modern__9c47c7cf-3372-45f8-a032-cbe29d621e86_1.png?t=1765893055)\n\nFollow image link: (https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/16/mozilla_corporation_new_ceo/)\n\nCaption: \n\n\n\nMozilla has [appointed](https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/16/mozilla_corporation_new_ceo/) Anthony Enzor-DeMeo as its new CEO, replacing Laura Chambers, who served as interim chief\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n_“zoom needs to stick with what it does best - meetings and webinars.

Nikita Gorshkov emphasized a  \n\nsix-week short-term cadence for impetus, while Laurent Guillemain confirmed  \n\nachievements would be measured through the quantifiable impact of delivered  \n\ninitiatives and a monthly ramp aligned with the OKR. Dovas Zakas, Laurent  \n\nGuillemain, and Nikita Gorshkov agreed that Pratik would manage the  \n\nconversion rate program for the first six months, focusing on initiatives  \n\nacross six pillars, with 20% of their time allocated to CVR and 20-30% to  \n\nretention, requiring a technical owner from the engineering team to support  \n\nthem.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested next steps\n\n\n\n\n\nNikita Gorshkov will have a discussion with Aron on Monday to figure out  \n\nthe actual capacity available.\n\n\n\nDovas Zakas will try to make the CVR tracking a bit more fair by looking at  \n\nmeta native or one of the search channels and track the 25% uplift on those  \n\nchannels.\n\n\n\nDovas Zakas will focus on the first draft of the tier co for the CVR  \n\nprogram and make a monthly ramp to get to the goals.\n\n\n\nNikita Gorshkov will get back with the name of the technical owner for the  \n\nCVR program.\n\n\n\nNikita Gorshkov will keep Dovas Zakas posted regarding the candidate for  \n\nthe analytics resource position.\n\n\n\nLaurent Guillemain and Dovas Zakas will align offline on the content of  \n\nslide three and slide six for the CVR program.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting records Document Notes by Gemini\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the summary section in this email helpful?\n\nNot Useful Email Useful Email\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle LLC, 1600 Ampitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA\n\n\n\nYou have received this email because meeting artifacts were initiated in  \n\nGoogle Meet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: 1.

Laura Loughran and Nikita Gorshkov raised concerns about the  \n\nsmall team's capacity to manage both the new Shopify site and existing  \n\noperations, agreeing that a dedicated Shopify team might be necessary to  \n\nhandle maintenance and questioning the future product ownership and  \n\nstrategy beyond basic maintenance, especially given team commitments like  \n\nSamir and Alli (Allison) to other projects. Nikita Gorshkov also noted the  \n\nteam, including Hammed and Michael, is working on significantly improving  \n\nthe legacy integrated site, particularly the PDP pages.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested next steps\n\n\n\n\n\nNikita Gorshkov will check Allison's schedule to confirm she will be  \n\navailable to support the Shopify site for the next couple of weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting records Document Notes by Gemini\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the summary section in this email helpful?\n\nNot Useful Email Useful Email\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle LLC, 1600 Ampitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA\n\n\n\nYou have received this email because meeting artifacts were initiated in  \n\nGoogle Meet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Case HR-156455 moved to HFSE-PS-HQ-IT&Sec, MarT, TAM, SCM, NoAll, GOAT, FoodS.,Act.J Service Team\nID: 19b3733c3c608ad5\nFrom: \"Workday@HelloFresh\" <hellofresh@myworkday.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\n[No readable text content found]\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Re: [HelloTech Launch Announcement] Global Chatbot rollout\nID: 19b3730fe55e3cd5\nFrom: Tilman Eichstaedt <te@hellofresh.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\n[No readable text content found]\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n### EMAIL: Your Navan login link\nID: 19b37294f0e54e1d\nFrom: Navan <no-reply@auth.navan.com>\n----------------------------------------\n\n<html lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\"\n\n  xmlns:o=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\"\n\n  style=\"font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
