For CR, we successfully launched the Reactivation page revamp and are on progress to launch the One Time Purchase experiment. On the AOR side, we drove Free Add-on take rates to over 90% consistently by closing gaps in the selection and persistence experience, and launched Charge at Checkout.\n\n1. Reactivation Page Revamp. We launched a new, mobile-first reactivation page that reduces the page length by one third with improvements on information architecture and clearer call to action. Also, customers can now choose their free add-ons directly on the reactivation page, instead of after reactivating their accounts. These changes are foundational to run more free for life reactivation campaigns including turkeys on Thanksgiving  (+20% CR YoY). However, some critical features were de-prioritized such as the ability to change cadence and reschedule directly on the reactivation page. \n\n2. One-Time Purchases (OTP). The technical solution for OTP pivoted from the initial MVP hack to the proper solution due to a technical blocker from CRM as well as higher confidence in the new endpoint following HF rollouts. While this solution saves time in the long-term, the launch week is delayed (likely W2’2026 - TBC) due to additional time for another technical investigation and (unplanned) capacity constraints.\n\n3. Closing Free Add-on Take Rate. By October we finally reached +90% free add-on take rate for both new and active users consistently. Persisting free add-ons (+40% active TR), developing the multi-add-on pop-up on funnel and reactivation (+5% TR), and migrating bundle offers to Wallet (4.2k customers). While it’s great that we finally closed down the Wallet take rate gap, a significant portion of Q3 engineering capacity was allocated, which was not originally accounted for in the H2 roadmap.\n\n4. Charge at Checkout. By charging customers at checkout instead of at cut-off, we aim to improve empty conversions and acceptance rates, thereby positively impacting overall delivered orders.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearnings: \n\n* Better resource planning for adhoc and technical initiatives needed: We only executed on 2 out of 5 key strategies referenced in the previous strategy document with projects such as the Pricing Value Experiment getting pushed to next year. When planning for H2 2025, we did not initially account for initiatives such as Subscribable free add ons, as well as more tactical initiatives like 2-week cadence or legal compliance initiatives in the (cancellation) funnel. Engineering capacity was also impacted around September-October due to personnel changes, including one transfer to TPT and two individuals taking parental leave. We also need to proactively account for resourcing technical initiatives such as endpoint deprecations and migrations.\n\n* More space needed for iterations: there are initiatives such as Seamless and Search with clear next iterations, however instead of building these we focused on building new initiatives. This delays implementing these learnings and therefore realization of business value. Doing these next iterations with too much time in between can also lengthen development as the team has to re-learn the technical context for the next iteration, or as previous feature leads churn from the team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Chop 2026 Product Strategy\n\nQ1 2026: Closing the Gaps an\n\n\n\nith new delivery options with 1 day cutoff\n\n[p]i think this should be dependent on OTP leads results\n\n[q]how come?

For CR, we successfully launched the Reactivation page revamp and are on progress to launch the One Time Purchase experiment. On the AOR side, we drove Free Add-on take rates to over 90% consistently by closing gaps in the selection and persistence experience, and launched Charge at Checkout.\n\n1. Reactivation Page Revamp. We launched a new, mobile-first reactivation page that reduces the page length by one third with improvements on information architecture and clearer call to action. Also, customers can now choose their free add-ons directly on the reactivation page, instead of after reactivating their accounts. These changes are foundational to run more free for life reactivation campaigns including turkeys on Thanksgiving  (+20% CR YoY). However, some critical features were de-prioritized such as the ability to change cadence and reschedule directly on the reactivation page. \n\n2. One-Time Purchases (OTP). The technical solution for OTP pivoted from the initial MVP hack to the proper solution due to a technical blocker from CRM as well as higher confidence in the new endpoint following HF rollouts. While this solution saves time in the long-term, the launch week is delayed (likely W2’2026 - TBC) due to additional time for another technical investigation and (unplanned) capacity constraints.\n\n3. Closing Free Add-on Take Rate. By October we finally reached +90% free add-on take rate for both new and active users consistently. Persisting free add-ons (+40% active TR), developing the multi-add-on pop-up on funnel and reactivation (+5% TR), and migrating bundle offers to Wallet (4.2k customers). While it’s great that we finally closed down the Wallet take rate gap, a significant portion of Q3 engineering capacity was allocated, which was not originally accounted for in the H2 roadmap.\n\n4. Charge at Checkout. By charging customers at checkout instead of at cut-off, we aim to improve empty conversions and acceptance rates, thereby positively impacting overall delivered orders.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearnings: \n\n* Better resource planning for adhoc and technical initiatives needed: We only executed on 2 out of 5 key strategies referenced in the previous strategy document with projects such as the Pricing Value Experiment getting pushed to next year. When planning for H2 2025, we did not initially account for initiatives such as Subscribable free add ons, as well as more tactical initiatives like 2-week cadence or legal compliance initiatives in the (cancellation) funnel. Engineering capacity was also impacted around September-October due to personnel changes, including one transfer to TPT and two individuals taking parental leave. We also need to proactively account for resourcing technical initiatives such as endpoint deprecations and migrations.\n\n* More space needed for iterations: there are initiatives such as Seamless and Search with clear next iterations, however instead of building these we focused on building new initiatives. This delays implementing these learnings and therefore realization of business value. Doing these next iterations with too much time in between can also lengthen development as the team has to re-learn the technical context for the next iter\n\n\n\npayment initiatives we should add?\n\n[c]bnpl? :eyes:\n\n[d]does ProcessOut unlock better capabilities (eg express checkout; bnpl)?\n\n\n\n\n\ntbc cc @nikita.gorshkov@hellofresh.com\n\n[e]More directly in our control: Payment failures experience in Actives experience\n\n\n\n\n\nrefer back to separate Payments discussions eg payment re-try\n\n[f]We had discussed the delivery date picker test.
