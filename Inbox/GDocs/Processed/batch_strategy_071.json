While Followers struggle to find the necessary ingredients and an easy way to re-cook them, Influencers look for new revenue streams to be more independent from the heavily controlled platforms and find new ways to expand their reach and engage with their audiences authentically and organically via food.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpportunity:\n\nHellofresh sees a huge opportunity to serve both: by transforming influencers' inspiration (recipe) into a shoppable, cookable meal kit for the consumers. \n\nBy bridging the gap as the Expert in operation, warehouses and logistics, we provide customers a way to enjoy these recipes easily and the influencer to serve their followers and create a new revenue stream. The social commerce market is growing rapidly and can represent a huge opportunity for us to attract new customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy now:\n\nWe see the urgency to act now, because influencers are already trying to solve this problem with links to ingredient orders  via Instacart or Pinterest partners with Instacart to enable 1-click grocery list generation from saved pins. But today, shoppable content on social media within the food category is often limited to individual food items as opposed to a holistic offering where the ingredients for entire recipes and direct delivery can be purchased. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Core Ask \n\nWBD: Influencer Marketplace\n\nExplore desired and viable vision for a curated recipe creator marketplace (1. influencer, 2.

      "content": "﻿TAM Product: GenAI Ways of Working\n\n \n\nTAM Product: Context-driven Product Management\n\n\tSummary: In 2025, thanks to the growing maturity of AI-based tools and products, the tech industry shifted from theoretical possibility to practical necessity of integrating AI into the daily processes of employees; HelloFresh as well has actively engaged into the exploration, deployment and integration of AI-based tools into the workplace across functions. This document aims to offer each product manager within TAM an easy step-by-step guide and inspiration on how your daily workflow can (and should) change through the integration of AI into every step of your daily workflow.\n\n\tCreated At: Aug 20, 2025\n\n\tLast Updated: Sep 16, 2025\n\n\tStatus: Review\n\n\tAuthor: Nikita Gorshkov\n\n\tAI Use: Yes\n\n\tContributors: \n\n\tBased On: GenAI: MVP Product Workflow Automation (Draft)CFA GenAI Adoption 2025GenAI: Strategy for Design WorkflowsTAM Product: GenAI Ways of Working\n\n\t\n\n\n\nProblem\n\nDelivery, efficiency expectations of leadership across HelloFresh generally and HelloTech in particular is being recalibrated to address the reality of AI-augmented staff capabilities; simply put - more and faster will be expected from every team member; that would stretch everyone if not mitigated by automation of intelligence-based repetitive work through AI integration.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples\n\nThe principles for the new AI-enabled product manager ways of working are grounded in the core principles of the New Model proposed by Assaf Ronenon 16.09.2025: \n\n1. Customer First: Every decision must begin with the customer and be anchored in satisfaction, retention, and lifetime value.\n\n2. One Global System: Wherever possible, we will converge on unified tools, processes, and standards, eliminating duplication.\n\n3. Speed and Agility: We will shorten decision cycles and empower leaders to experiment, learn, and scale quickly.\n\n4. Clear Accountability: Each decision will have a single owner with the authority and responsibility to deliver outcomes.\n\n5. MD-Integrated Organization: Managing Directors (MDs) own the P&L for each geography. Central functions must be responsive, enabling local experimentation while ensuring it aligns with globally defined systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nThe solution to the growing problem of increased expectations is not only the training and learning of effective use of individual tools by product managers; but ensuring all individual tools can be combined into a comprehensive process, ensuring that core components, assets, artefacts, tools, best practices are reused, expanded, sustained and followed, empowering individuals to achieve peak performance within this new age. It’s important to establish a set of core principles that should be guiding your work: \n\n\n\n\n\n1. You are responsible: whatever you do and whatever you create and submit - there is no substitution from your personal responsibility, your content, data, findings, priorities etc. that might be generated by an AI are, at the end of the day, your responsibility. \n\n2. AI isn’t the end-all-be-all: AI can do some things well, others brilliantly, a lot - not so well, it is up to you to balance where to use AI, there is (despite the hype) no (and cannot be) any substitute for your creativity, passion, quality and communication - you are you with AI or without. \n\n3. Product principles are here to stay: our product principles, ways of thinking about customers and their problems, data and KPIs, goals, solutions and strategies are still as relevant as they were before - they will enable you to benefit from the new capabi\n\n\n\nu are reporting out on - ensure that all MAR/QARs and tactical reports are added into the NotebookLM for your team - share the NotebookLM with the team and stakeholders. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis document is not aimed to be comprehensive or cover every single aspect of product management and the SDLC process, this is not only impossible, but also would assume a static reality where processes and approaches would not change. Especially right now - that is not the case. We are all in a world where a new technology is changing the way we all work, this technology is in its infancy and lacks strong product cases, integrations and has existing limitations; this situation is similar to where product management was when the iPhone 1/2 were released - nobody knew where and how the technologies would evolve, how this changes product management and the products that we build; the key right now is for you to remain curious, flexible and quick - don’t focus too much on existing products and tools, focus on building your comfort level when working with GenAI, understand the fundamental benefits and limitations of the technology, ideate, experiment and try new things, build confidence when working with it and know where it’s particularly strong. \n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the most important piece to remember is that this is just a technology, it’s up to us, humans to define how we use it and be responsible for the outcomes that we are able to achieve with it. Even in the last couple of weeks as this document was being written, more and more it became apparent that human input, guidance and effort is not going anywhere to ensure that we solve problems for other humans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemp: Notes\n\nNote 1: add context-driven/spec driven development concepts\n\n\n\n\n\n[a]Do you also mean by this that basically with making sure that everything is contextually described, the product manager should also know exactly what's in production because they can see the context that was used to generate certain production features?\n\n[b]Yes, I don't expect that the product manager has the complete understanding of every single feature, but, I am expecting that a product manager orchestrates that the context of their domain is clear, maintained and relevant.\n\n[c]1 total reaction\n\nLeo Lee reacted with ➕ at 2025-09-26 14:06 PM\n\n[d]Love this!\n\n1 total reaction\n\nNikita Gorshkov reacted with 🎉 at 2025-09-18 11:46 AM",

Is this referring to paying an initial payment for their first time posting? Is there another 'trial' option we are considering?\n\n[b]One thing that was pretty consistent with the influencers we already spoke with is that they aren't aware of other services like this. We may not get helpful feedback if we are comparing to other similar services. But I think understanding what missing features would increase the value overall is helpful to figure out\n\n[c]I think in the script we can keep the intro we are already using and maybe shorten the section about them and their content.

I think getting some more data on how they follow trends might be helpful and I do want to ask about their pricing expectations around the 'set your own price' idea. I know they said they don't need data on it, but I think it would still be helpful to gather some since we won't have many opportunities to speak with influencers.\n\n[c]would we need to create a hellofresh shop with all influencer recipes to shop and the influencer itself advertise it?",

While Followers struggle to find the necessary ingredients and an easy way to re-cook them, Influencers look for new revenue streams to be more independent from the heavily controlled platforms and find new ways to expand their reach and engage with their audiences authentically and organically via food.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpportunity:\n\nHellofresh sees a huge opportunity to serve both: by transforming influencers' inspiration (recipe) into a shoppable, cookable meal kit for the consumers. \n\nBy bridging the gap as the Expert in operation, warehouses and logistics, we provide customers a way to enjoy these recipes easily and the influencer to serve their followers and create a new revenue stream. The social commerce market is growing rapidly and can represent a huge opportunity for us to attract new customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy now:\n\nWe see the urgency to act now, because influencers are already trying to solve this problem with links to ingredient orders  via Instacart or Pinterest partners with Instacart to enable 1-click grocery list generation from saved pins. But today, shoppable content on social media within the food category is often limited to individual food items as opposed to a holistic offering where the ingredients for entire recipes and direct delivery can be purchased. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Core Ask \n\nWBD: Influencer Marketplace\n\nExplore desired and viable vision for a curated recipe creator marketplace (1. influencer, 2.

Quality, Packaging and Ingredient SKU innovation 2. XL Menu Expansion5. Efficiency Program/Cost to Serve \n\nDescription: Our objective is to ensure our front-line associates are proud to be part of the HelloFresh team by building an engaged, safe, and reliable workforce. We will enhance the employee experience through consistent HR processes, clear manager expectations, and a focus on safety and respect, all of which will directly improve labor efficiency and cost.\n\n1. Scalable people foundation: In line with operations project Highlander we will seek to establish standards related to Field People including defining operational jobs and career progression, staffing footprint based on building type and size, shift schedules, labor planning approach, employee relations and policy frameworks, etc. to facilitate consistent operating models that scale along with our single operational technology stack. We will standardize only where there is a clear benefit in 1) deploying standard processes and tools for labor planning or 2) solving employee pain points that result in expected enhancement in early retention. \n\n2. Global Workforce Health Mechanism: We will establish and build on mechanisms to review operational healthiness with a consistent focus on the right workforce mix, attrition, absenteeism, and engagement. We will partner with operations to harmonize  weekly reviews and ensure deliberate action is taken to address pain points with the goal of identifying and quickly solving employee and staffing issues with a repeatable feedback loop. \n\n3. Global Workday Implementation: We will implement FreshField globally to have 100% of workers in our system. This will facilitate improved visibility into our labor availability, enhanced reconciliation for invoicing of contingent labor, and facilitate better communication with employees through engagement feedback loop touchpoints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

Our HRBPs will work with leaders to have clear talent priorities that enable our top 5 strategies. They will partner with our COEs so that our talent processes and rituals are used as tools to bring those objectives to life.  We will achieve this by setting clear expectations, modeling the right behaviors, and providing data to enable accountability. \n\n\n\n\n\n1. Defining & Reporting on Business Talent Objectives: HRBPs will spend the rest of 2026 defining concrete talent objectives and the GLT will implement a quarterly reporting mechanism to show progress versus those initiatives. Example initiatives include: Design the target footprint for the MD organization and transition to that footprint by EOY. Implement a multi-location talent strategy to increase the number of Engineers as a percentage of the total tech team populat\n\n\n\n in technology investment. We also experience meaningful spikes in unplanned work that may require us to re-prioritize. Additionally, as an organization we are yet to mature in terms of processes, leadership capability, and ways of working. This creates both opportunity for growth and significant dependency on HR, as managers often lack the skills to independently handle people issues, engagement, and grievance management. While standardisation (systems, tools, processes) offers potential benefits, the organisation may not yet be ready; building managerial and organisational capability is a necessary foundation. Without this, HR will remain overstretched, providing compensatory support instead of enabling a more self-sufficient & independently capable leaders & business.\n\n\n\n      * What objectives would MDs and other key stakeholders be most disappointed to have left out for 2026? \n\n         1.
