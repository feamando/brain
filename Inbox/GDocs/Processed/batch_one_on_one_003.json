Sameer Doda detailed their involvement in the complex Good Chop Shopify project, the DACH Juices support project for Nordic markets that requires a technical solution, and the Influencer Marketplace, which needs an MVP path forward due to varied stakeholder views and already has design progress with Shay; Sameer Doda and Nikita Gorshkov agreed on a simple one-time purchase customer journey for the MVP, but Sameer Doda raised concerns about limitations with applying vouchers and selling add-ons, which Nikita Gorshkov suggested discussing with Jama, and both acknowledged a need for more frontend development resources. Sameer Doda needs to coordinate with Jama for the roadmap review meeting and discussed the \"Seamless Pricing Upgrade\" initiative, which Nikita Gorshkov suggested de-prioritizing, while they also agreed to maintain two different views of the roadmap and implement an intake process with Ian as the tactical point of contact.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\nNotes Length: Standard\n\n* Overall Work Volume and Resource Allocation Sameer Doda confirmed that their overall volume of work is manageable, with Allison assisting on the platform and Good Chop Shopify projects. Sameer Doda and Nikita Gorshkov discussed that the revival of programs is unlikely soon due to a lack of available resources, unless it is fully funded, a decision that would need to come from Dominic (00:00:49) (00:04:03). Nikita Gorshkov noted that they, along with David, pushed back on Marina for introducing unfunded work that was taking up design capacity (00:03:05).\n\n* Shopify Initiatives (Factor Form and Good Chop) Sameer Doda outlined their involvement in the Shopify projects, specifically Good Chop, which they anticipate will be more complex than Factor Form due to potential changes in the customer journey (00:00:49). The immediate next steps for the Good Chop project include developing a strategy document, creating a customer journey, and addressing edge cases such as account duplication and customer redirects, in addition to tactical work like third-party integrations (e.g., Recharge and Elevar) (00:02:10). Sameer Doda is confident that they can now manage the setup of Recharge if Allison is unavailable (00:03:05).\n\n* DACH Juices Support Project Sameer Doda explained that Jama brought up a project to support launching juices in the Nordic markets, which Sameer Doda discussed with stakeholders and promised to provide timelines for in January (00:04:54). The required technical work involves automatically adding fan charges as a separate line item to the cart and to the auto summary when a juice pack is added, a task that is more complicated than it appears. Sameer Doda plans to create a requirements document after receiving answers to questions they posed to Viola (00:06:15).\n\n* Influencer Marketplace Strategy and Customer Journey Sameer Doda has gone through all the research documents for the influencer marketplace and believes the initiative needs a proposed path forward for the MVP due to the variety of stakeholder views. They have created two separate customer journeys: one for customers \n\n\n\ne used to do was that we used to write it down in these cells themselves. Uh allocation start. So allocating allocating in these in these boxes themselves it kind of gives Oh yeah I I agree all of these versions they work perfectly.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: dude, I think over the 17 years I've seen every single version of how a road map can humanly look like. Oh, like uh I've updated the initiatives log with the new items that uh they had on this wish list.\n\nSameer Doda: It's just about I I think it boils down to personal preferences at the end of it and the ease of use for for at an individual level. That that's pretty much it.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: Uh yeah, I don't know how it's maintained or or updated, but at least now it's Yep, agree.\n\n \n\n \n\n00:29:54\n\n \n\nSameer Doda: Okay, I also created this intake sheet. Uh if you see the third tab, we can probably start evangelizing this as well for anyone who wants to add a request, they can add to this.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: We just need to figure out how exactly we and to whom we do evangelize this.\n\nSameer Doda: I know, I know, I get it.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: My my targets are going to be I want to make that Ian the tactical point of contact essentially like I don't want to be talking with a thousand different people. Uh, and I don't uh or you talking with a thousand different people and I don't want us to be talking like three times a week because like uh with Ed because that's a recipe for failure. He has way too much s*** on his uh plate so he will never be available and then we're here shoveling dirt from oh US is saying one thing and Ben is saying another thing.\n\nSameer Doda: Oh, yeah.\n\nNikita Gorshkov: So I do want like Ian maybe and maybe somebody on the US sides to actually like have a small group of like decision makers and if there's a tiebreaker that's needed on that level or above then yes we can go to it.\n\nSameer Doda: Yeah, 100%. But I mean even Jama said that the frequency for such a road map review would be like once a month something like that just to give visibility on where we are and all of these other decisions on what\n\nNikita Gorshkov: That's true.\n\nSameer Doda: gets prioritized on the road map can be handled se separately. Cool. Uh yeah.\n\n \n\n \n\nTranscription ended after 00:31:33\n\n\n\n\n\nThis editable transcript was computer generated and might contain errors.
