      "summary": "HelloFresh is integrating with InComm to launch a new retail gift card program across North America (US and Canada). The integration involves a transferred value activation process where physical gift cards are activated at retail, and consumers use PINs to redeem value through HelloFresh's system via InComm's API. Key discussions covered technical requirements for PIN validation, redemption flows, error handling, reporting capabilities, and contract negotiations for a potential unified North American agreement.",
