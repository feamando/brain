      "summary": "This initiative aims to unify cancellation funnels across all HelloFresh Group brands by replicating the proven HelloFresh cancellation flow UX to other brands including meal-kit, RTE, The PetsTable, GoodChop, and Factor. The project will standardize the cancellation experience, implement consistent surveys, and unify deflection strategies to improve customer retention and streamline operational maintenance.",

          "Standardize cancellation surveys across brands using HelloFresh framework",
          "Implement special deflections: Benefits of keeping subscription (discounts, credits, loyalty status)",
