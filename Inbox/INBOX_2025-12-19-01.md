Summary

Nikita Gorshkov provided Samir and Allison with praise for the successful launch of the US factor form Shopify B2B store and discussed the technical requirements with Ian Brooks for replicating this store for a Canadian factor, including URL configuration and core infrastructure needs. They decided that the Canadian pilot should use static content and minimal initial integrations, estimating that the necessary work, including URL setup, some infrastructure, and basic tracking, would require one product resource and one engineering resource for about two weeks. Nikita Gorshkov suggested a B2B proof of concept with minimal integrations could cost less than $100k (USD) as a one-time charge from Anata, in addition to the $24,000 USD annual Shopify enterprise license fee, which Ian Brooks noted would significantly increase the pilot cost.





Details

* B2B Shopify Store Launch and Technical Requirements Nikita Gorshkov mentioned the recent launch of the factor form Shopify B2B store, which was completed by Samir and Allison yesterday, giving them "huge kudos". Ian Brooks sought clarification on the technical requirements for setting up the B2B store for a factor in Canada, to which Nikita Gorshkov specified the need for technical support regarding URL configuration and core infrastructure (00:00:00). They also noted that if they replicate the US store setup, they would require a team to support catalog management, suggesting options for either weekly menu uploads or a technical resource to ensure integration between catalog and menu management systems (00:01:14).

* Menu Management and Catalog Upload Efficiency Nikita Gorshkov and Ian Brooks discussed the effort required for menu uploads, with Nikita Gorshkov explaining that while text and images are relatively easy, nutritional information entry takes time, which is why automations were previously developed. They attempted to offshore this to Hello Connect two years ago, but the quality was poor, which surprised Ian Brooks, as Hello Connect handles a significant portion of their meal kit menu (00:02:28). Nikita Gorshkov argued that it would be more efficient to upload the entire catalog once and then manage which items are enabled weekly, which Ian Brooks considered "super easy" and achievable in a sprint (00:03:42).

* Proposed Setup and Resource Requirements for Canadian B2B Store Discussing the setup for the Canadian pilot, Nikita Gorshkov agreed with Ian Brooks that they should not build complex integrations initially and suggested having static content with certain items visible or invisible. From a technical perspective, the required work includes setting up URLs, some infrastructure work, and tracking, noting that basic tracking is provided by Shopify, but connecting to any CRM would require CRM connectors (00:04:39). Nikita Gorshkov estimated that establishing the store, even with less automation and tracking than the original setup, would require one product resource and one engineering resource for about two weeks, assuming they can secure the engineering resource (00:05:41).

* Cost Estimates and Operational Structure for Shopify Stores Nikita Gorshkov provided cost estimates for similar Shopify projects, noting that while VMS cost $400k (USD), they managed to get the good shop marketplace to $175k (USD) and suggested the B2B proof of concept, with minimal integrations and no subscription module, could be less than $100k

t for either. I think both of them could provide a relatively good indication of where this product could be going.

Ian Brooks: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: It's just um yeah, that's pretty much it. We can make the discussion in terms of what where are the pros and cons and maybe by when we have the dates when we're we have that meeting, I'll just prepare in terms of like here's the uh decision tree and here's how we get to the end state where we have both and these are the pros and cons and let's just hash it out there.

Summary

Laurent Guillemain introduced the one-year conversion rate program with multiple time-boxed initiatives aimed at achieving 2026 OKRs, with Dovas Zakas detailing the objective of a 25% year-on-year CVR improvement, focusing on dependable channels for tracking. Nikita Gorshkov emphasized a six-week short-term cadence for impetus, while Laurent Guillemain confirmed achievements would be measured through the quantifiable impact of delivered initiatives and a monthly ramp aligned with the OKR. Dovas Zakas, Laurent Guillemain, and Nikita Gorshkov agreed that Pratik would manage the conversion rate program for the first six months, focusing on initiatives across six pillars, with 20% of their time allocated to CVR and 20-30% to retention, requiring a technical owner from the engineering team to support them.





Details

* Conversion Rate Program Structure and Governance Laurent Guillemain introduced the conversion rate program, explaining the shift towards program-based approaches to drive change due to increased complexity in larger organizations and past difficulties with resourcing (00:00:00). They stated that the program is not a three-month effort but an ongoing one-year program with multiple time-boxed initiatives, aimed at achieving 2026 OKRs (00:01:17). Dovas Zakas noted the importance of having someone from the tech team manage the program, as the majority of the impact will come through features and technology (00:08:37).

* Program Cadence and Measurement Nikita Gorshkov emphasized the need for a short-term cadence, such as six weeks, to maintain impetus and provide a sense of delivered achievement for engineering teams, countering the feeling of a "consistent slog" for long-term programs (00:02:09). Laurent Guillemain agreed, stating that achievements should be marked by the delivery of initiatives and their quantifiable impact through analytics, adding that there will be a monthly ramp with goals aligned to the OKR target (00:03:26). The retention program was highlighted as an example, featuring ramped goals throughout the year and a monthly tracking of average AO (Average Order) versus the target (00:04:33) (00:19:31).

* Conversion Rate Program Objectives and Tracking Dovas Zakas detailed that the OKR is to improve CVR (Conversion Rate) by 25% year on year, acknowledging the difficulty in tracking the blended number due to varying channel performance, such as direct sales and app (00:06:58). They plan to focus on more dependable channels like Meta native or one of the search channels for tracking the 25% uplift to ensure fairness (00:08:37). Dovas Zakas also presented an initial list of 25-30 initiatives across six pillars—quiz, price and offer testing, landing pages, post-quiz, program ops, and RAPH (00:09:44).

* Program Ownership and Staffing The group discussed the program manager role, noting that Maria previously managed it but was stretched (00:00:00). Laurent Guillemain outlined that for the retention program, Reena is the program manager who owns the plan and reports on progress, managing the link with individual initiative owners (00:05:35). Dovas Zakas expressed excitement about Pratik taking on the conversion rate program, seeing it as a good onboarding and test to ensure they can quickly grasp all topics (00:11:42). Nikita Gorshkov agreed, noting that Pratik brings relevant experience in building and optimizing funnels and convers

,

Dovas Zakas: Yeah.

Laurent Guillemain: and they start to give feedback as well at some point, which is kind of nice, right? They're not just a lump.

Nikita Gorshkov: I mean she was never a lump.

Dovas Zakas: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: She was very attentive from day one, which is super cool. But um yeah, it's uh it I mean it it is a magical feeling. I you folks know all about it. It's uh when people without kids ask me, I struggle to explain it

Dovas Zakas: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: necessarily.

Dovas Zakas: But right now it's purely physical like the challenges and then to get it changes to a point that I don't even remember how hard it was. But now everything is a negotiation.

 

 

00:27:12

 

Nikita Gorshkov: And that's when you get the second group.

Dovas Zakas: What?

Nikita Gorshkov: And then you get the second kid because you forgot how hard it

Dovas Zakas: Yeah. Exactly.

Laurent Guillemain: Um what one other thing and maybe actually you can update us offline on this one but um just the

Nikita Gorshkov: is.

Dovas Zakas: Exactly.

Laurent Guillemain: app scoping document I know you've given it to Pritique uh but it would be I'm a little like I'm interested to see what with what Pritique comes up with in the document considering he hasn't been involved in the discussion so far. But let's see. And we'll probably need to align quite a bit on the output.

Nikita Gorshkov: I mean I I did provide him with essentially the majority guidance

Laurent Guillemain: Um

Nikita Gorshkov: and how I see the PC v 0 scope and v1 scope. I actually need more Daniel's input right now than anything because of uh on the technical side to make decisions in terms of what exactly um where the new architecture is going to be beneficial for us and where we're just going to go with web views and I first need to catch him. So um I can actually like it's it's a very rough draft at the moment but nothing too crazy.

Laurent Guillemain: Do do you want us all ready to read through it? Is it at the stage where? No, no, no. I I will only read through it when you want me to read through it to me rather than me piece me or going for it. Okay, awesome. Well, good luck with the sleeping and good weekend. Bye.

Summary

Laura Loughran welcomed Nikita Gorshkov back, and they discussed the recent Shopify launch, confirming that traffic strategy will be decided in January after analyzing conversion rates, and Nikita Gorshkov confirmed the OTP launch is still targeting the 5th, with a full end-to-end UAT scheduled for the 30th. Laura Loughran and Nikita Gorshkov raised concerns about the small team’s capacity to manage both the new Shopify site and existing operations, agreeing that a dedicated Shopify team might be necessary to handle maintenance and questioning the future product ownership and strategy beyond basic maintenance, especially given team commitments like Samir and Alli (Allison) to other projects. Nikita Gorshkov also noted the team, including Hammed and Michael, is working on significantly improving the legacy integrated site, particularly the PDP pages.





Details

* Return and Personal Update Laura Loughran welcomed Nikita Gorshkov back, and they shared that their little one is doing great, noting that although it is "a lot", they are finding a pattern with sleep and the child is a "bundle of joy". The child's name is Na Adelated (00:00:00).

* Shopify Launch and Traffic Strategy Laura Loughran reported that they launched Shopify yesterday, but they are not yet driving traffic to it (00:00:00). They plan to wait until after Christmas to see the conversion rate on the paid side and then decide in January how to allocate traffic between the new site and the legacy site (00:06:28).

* OTP Launch and UAT Scheduling Nikita Gorshkov confirmed that they are still targeting the 5th for the OTP launch, expecting traffic to pick up from that date due to New Year's. They acknowledged that they will lose some conversions but not too many, and they have scheduled a full end-to-end UAT for the 30th to resolve any lingering issues (00:06:28). Nikita Gorshkov also noted that they have a list of known bugs that the team is currently fixing (00:07:34).

* Team Capacity and Future Ownership of Shopify Laura Loughran raised a concern about managing both the new Shopify site and the existing operations with a small team and questioned what product ownership of the Shopify site would look like moving forward (00:07:34). Nikita Gorshkov responded that they do not know at the moment, as the team members involved, Samir and Alli (Allison), are already committed to other projects like the GCNL closure, the launch of HelloFresh premium tier, and the recipe creator marketplace with Ian (00:08:39).

* Need for Dedicated Shopify Team Nikita Gorshkov stated that they believe they need to figure out the staffing in a consolidated way and suggested they might need to go to Ed to request a dedicated Shopify team to handle at least the "KTLO stuff" (Keep the Lights On) for these sites (00:08:39). Laura Loughran agreed and confirmed alignment, suggesting that one PM or one team might be able to cover all the sites, as they do not believe any single site requires full-time maintenance (00:10:14).

* Product Strategy for Site Ownership Nikita Gorshkov further questioned what the PM would be accountable for beyond maintenance, asking what "product strategy" the person would contribute towards, especially regarding development and potential needs for new PDP pages, which would require a designer (00:10:14). They acknowledged that longer-term integrations and automation topics could be handled by the engineering s

the legacy side to a state of competitiveness. Let's put it like that and that uh so that we can see and because for good shop as well I need to like theoretically we could do everything uh Shopify is providing but I also acknowledge that it's not as fast but it has other other benefits and other you know cost benefits uh longer term anyway

 

 

00:12:44

 

Laura Loughran: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. So,

Nikita Gorshkov: Okay.

Laura Loughran: it sounds like I think we can't can't even make any decisions till we see how I see how the site performs. And then if it's like, oh my god, it's 3x better, then we make decisions accordingly. And if not, then we, you know, make different decisions. So, we'll see how it goes and then um we can determine how to consolidate,

Nikita Gorshkov: Yep.

Laura Loughran: shift, move forward in the future.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yep.

Laura Loughran: But I guess for the next like couple of weeks, can I assume that Allison will at least be around to support

Nikita Gorshkov: Yes. Yeah. I I'll check with her.

Laura Loughran: Okay.

Nikita Gorshkov: Let me check with her schedule. Like there's always uh somebody on call obviously uh on our ends. Um I'm meeting with her today. I I'll double check uh with her on uh on her schedule.

Laura Loughran: Cool.

Nikita Gorshkov: She should be around holiday schedule.

Laura Loughran: All right.

Nikita Gorshkov: Cool.

Laura Loughran: All right. I think that's everything, but yeah, happy to have you back. Um, and I'll keep you in the loop as we continue to learn and try new things.

Nikita Gorshkov: Nice. Cool. Yeah, exciting stuff.

Laura Loughran: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: Um, I've also like I've been working with Hamemeds uh and now with Michael quite a bit. So, I think we'll be improving the the leg legacy uh integrated site uh quite a bit. I've also pushed them to be a bit more like this is the whole thing like if if we um if we believe that we're also selling a a particular lifestyle with all of the options that we're providing um to our customers like I think we need to go a bit farther than what we have right now in the PDP pages which is like a Amazon PDP page which is built for a completely different function.

Meeting records Transcript 





Summary

Beatrice Dimarucut and Nikita Gorshkov discussed improving product imagery, testing refunds for one-time purchases, and increasing allocation for Christmas due to working ad tech tracking. They agreed to prioritize finishing upsells and new dashboards despite the potential increase in pause or cancellation rates from displaying future deliveries, as the expected rise in Average Order Value (AOV) should compensate. Beatrice Dimarucut set a tentative January 20th launch date for One-Time Purchase (OTP) and raised concerns about running the OTP allocation and price value funnel test concurrently due to potential result interpretation difficulties, deciding to consult with Ferron from PA. Nikita Gorshkov shared updates on an upcoming external CS5 role posting and announced their own promotion, which will involve supporting New Ventures, additional teams, and a planned B2B topic push.





Details

* Product Imagery and Facility Visit Beatrice Dimarucut shared that visiting the processing facilities was a cool experience and noted that the product looked better in person than in the images online. Nikita Gorshkov agreed that the issue might be with the imagery and photography used on the website, suggesting it needs to come through better (00:00:00).

* Ad Tech, Refunds, and Allocation Beatrice Dimarucut mentioned that the ad tech tracking seems to be working and that they were preparing to test refunds for one-time purchases. They also considered increasing allocation over Christmas, and Nikita Gorshkov supported this, noting that allocation could always be decreased later and that there is still time until Christmas (00:01:06). Beatrice Dimarucut confirmed they would run another test today and asked Nikita Gorshkov when they would be off, to which they replied that they are "always on" (00:02:28).

* Future Boxes Date Picker Implementation Beatrice Dimarucut brought up a thread from Maria about future boxes, which Nikita Gorshkov had already answered, noting it was related to changes in the dashboard (00:02:28). The discussion focused on using a date picker to display the next box's date, as scrolling was deemed impractical due to the single view being too packed (00:03:27). Nikita Gorshkov advocated for thinking outside the box for design solutions, such as displaying the three key deliveries (past, current, future) more actionably instead of a traditional date picker component (00:04:15).

* Dashboard Milestones and Pause Rates Nikita Gorshkov recognized that the display of future deliveries might increase pause or cancellation rates. However, they concluded that focusing on delivering the upsells and new dashboards first should remain the priority, as the expected increase in Average Order Value (AOV) might offset any negative impact on pause or cancellation rates (00:05:16).

* One-Time Purchase Launch and Price Value Funnel Test Beatrice Dimarucut set a tentative new launch date of January 20th for One-Time Purchase (OTP) due to unfinished work like post-checkout and the order confirmation page. They also planned a price value funnel test, which involves changing either the price or the menu for different user groups (00:06:25). Beatrice Dimarucut expressed concern about running both the OTP allocation and the price value test in parallel, as both allocate on the plans page, raising questions about potential difficulty in interpreting the results due to interaction effec

Beatrice Dimarucut: it five?

Nikita Gorshkov: So, it's it's CS5. Yeah.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Okay. Okay. Got

Nikita Gorshkov: and then we finalize your promo. Um,

Beatrice Dimarucut: it.

Nikita Gorshkov: and yeah, then we're in a good spot. Oh, um, just FYI, because there's an email that's going to come out starting, uh, Monday, um, I got a promotion, so I think I would be able to serve you folks a bit more, um, with a bit more, uh, oomph.

 

 

00:12:46

 

Nikita Gorshkov: I'll put like that. Uh,

Beatrice Dimarucut: Congratulations.

Nikita Gorshkov: so yeah,

Beatrice Dimarucut: That's amazing.

Nikita Gorshkov: thank you.

Beatrice Dimarucut: I know this is also like um it didn't go through like last uh last time, right? Congratulations.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah,

Beatrice Dimarucut: That's awesome.

Nikita Gorshkov: thanks.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Um is your scope changing?

Nikita Gorshkov: Well, the scope has already changed, so it's still going to be new ventures.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Oh, yeah. Okay.

Nikita Gorshkov: We have that bigger team,

Beatrice Dimarucut: Okay.

Nikita Gorshkov: but we to be fair, I'm anticipating that we're going to have probably two more teams uh dropping into our space in the next year. We have an M&A case that's going to drop in with also with a PM, and there's a bunch of things that we need to do.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Interesting.

Nikita Gorshkov: And there is going to be I am looking into the tea leaves and I'm assuming that there's uh a B2B topic that's going to be pushed through but I'm going to like I'm going to firewall this whole thing so that anything B2B related anything to do with Adam and Park on B2B or uh foods will be isolated and something um so

Beatrice Dimarucut: Uh, okay. Because it won't like as in you're going to try to get a dedicated squad to it.

Nikita Gorshkov: Yeah, exactly. I need separate funding.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Okay.

Nikita Gorshkov: I don't want like it it has a tendency like to eat any resource that you throw at

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: it and despise.

Beatrice Dimarucut: Yeah. Yeah.

Nikita Gorshkov: All right, I need to jump to talk with Laurel. Uh, no, with Laura. Thank you. Thank you.

🛣️ Q2+Q3 Roadmap

Solenne, Ahmed, Tobias and I sat down and put our planned projects into a roadmap for Q2 and Q3. Tobias and Solenne presented this roadmap to Yoav and Annie and received good feedback about it. In the second tab of the spreadsheet we listed the priorities, with Porterhouse leading the list. Whenever we have to make a hard choice between two deliveries, we will decide for the one with the higher priority. That makes projects with lower priority more likely to be delayed than the ones with higher priority. If you have any concern of a high-priority project, please let Tobias and Solenne know as soon as possible.

💻 Tech Initiatives

                                                                                                                                    * The BFF migration in the mobile app is almost almost almost complete. We can expect the initiative to be complete early next week. There are still some cleaning up to do on web and mobile.

By the end of next week, we should have also migrated the Delivery Tracking and RaF routes.

💸 Additional Vouchers

One of Engagement's sprint goals is to support Additional Vouchers in our price calculation logic for web and mobile. This week we started working on the website, refactoring the voucher Redux logic (🍝) and implementing the action to fetch a subscription's additional voucher info.

🔪 Killing Alice

This week we removed the last API call to Alice: update payment method in web. Before Alice is really killed in Intfood (expected mid April), we will need to do a force update of our mobile app to prevent users from using old versions that are still using the old endpoints.

🛒 Add-ons

The Happiness team started to implement some changes for Add-Ons, and was able to setup some add-ons SKUs in staging.

﻿Beam Integration for The Pets Table

________________









Beam Integration for The Pets Table

	Summary: Beam is a social impact integration platform that enables companies to donate a percentage of a customer's purchase to a charity. Instead of the company choosing the cause, Beam allows the user to select the specific charity they want to support from a curated list. 

The Pets Table plans to launch Beam as a conversion rate improvement tool and retention booster. 

	Created At: Dec 19, 2025

	Last Updated: Dec 19, 2025

	Editor(s): Maria Chelminska

	Strategy: xxx

	Figma: link

	Business Scoping Doc / Other documentation: link

	Context

User Problem

As a pet food subscription user, I am struggling with: 

* Choice Overload: Pet food subscription users are faced with a vast number of choices regarding food types and producers, making it difficult to decide which specific brand to commit to.

* Lack of Purpose: Customers are looking for additional reasons or a sense of purpose when choosing a producer; they often feel "powerless" to make a real difference and want their "consumer power" to result in tangible social impact

Vision

By integrating with Beam, we want to transform the decision to subscribe to The Pets Table into a more emotional experience by providing users with a clear purpose. By allowing customers to choose a high-impact nonprofit to support at no extra cost, the brand shifts the relationship from a standard transaction to a mission-driven partnership

Success Metrics:

* Gross CVR improvement (define the breakeven?) 

* AOR improvement

* CVA improvement

Scope

V1 Focus: For the initial version, the integration will be limited to the conversion funnel.

* Excluded Elements: V1 will not include the active experience component (the post-purchase subscriber dashboard in settings, impact tracking or cancelaltion deflection components).

* Included funnel Touchpoints:

   * Early Funnel Teasers: Informing users about the donation option during the quiz, meal selection, or registration steps.

      * To be decided on which step, candidates: 

         * Loading between funnel and plans selection, 

         * popup message in the quiz (e.g. on the body condition question) - to make it more emotional 

         * registration page, 

   * Charity opt-in and selection on checkout: The primary interaction point where the user selects a curated charity. This component will be available on the /checkout/payment step. For mobile, this will sit below the Order Summary; for web, it will sit between the summary and the assurance message 

  



   * Consider adding a Thank you message after the user interacts with the selection component



   * V2 (if experiment is successful)

   * API integration in order to automate data sharing between TPT and Beam and automate donation transfers. 

Requirements

Requirement Area

	Current Problem or User Story

	Requirement

	Prio

	Solution / Visual Reference 

	Early Funnel Teaser

	As an indecisive user, I want to be informed about the option to donate my money early.

	Include a “teaser” about Beam in the upper funnnel. Options: 

Loading before meals

Information under one of the questions “Did you know…” 

Registration (but already quite late)

	P1 

	



	Checkout Selection

	As a user, I want to choose the specific cause my purchase supports.

	The selection of charities is optional, but it is easily accessible to the user on the checkout pages

	P0

	



	Selection Acknowlegement / Confirmation

	As a user, I want confirmation that my choice was recorded.

	Thank You Page Impact: Display the selected charity and a reminder of the impact made.

	P2

	



	Experimentation

	As a TPT team we are easily able to track the impact of Beam integration and calculate the ROI

	



	P0

	



	



Experimentation

Setup: 

   * A/B test

   * A - control

   * B - variation, allocation on the point of showing the “Teaser” 

   * 50/50 split

   * Primary metric: gross CVR 

   * Secondary metrics:

   * micro conversion rate from the allocation page to the next page (depending on allocation)

   * CVR

   * AOR 

   * Experimentation Platform: Statsig (Run and implemented by The Pets Table team)

Implementation Details:

For V1

   * For the duration of the test the Information about completed transactions will be shared manually, on a monthly basis we will be sharing the list of successful transactions along with the selected fondation, and user_id. 

   * Next Steps + Ownership

Open Questions: 

   1. What are the available charities you support? How should we design the list? Should we go beyond “food for dogs” and support also clinics / vets? What are the options?

   1. TPT predefined charity - e.g. shelters for dogs in NYC (HQ) 

   2. Local shelter

   3. State-level dog charity (based on API) 

   4. International, high credibility 

   2. What are your learnings from long funnels? What is in your opinion the best placement for the funnel?

   3. Additional ideas: Have you ever tested a Thank you message (sth like “thank you for your contribution”)? 

   4. What are the best copywriting insights you have?

   5. How important is ensuring that the donations will be made for every order, until the user cancels? 

   6. Legal - do you have an example of T&Cs? Where are T&Cs placed? 

   7. Who is responsible for designs? What is the split of ownership? 

   8. Any limitations we should be aware of given limiting the experiment to the funnel only? (the semi-manual solution?

Accessibility-2026 Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Accessibility-2026 Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Welcome! The Accessibility-2026 Program will enable HelloFresh Group to comply with the modern level of accessibility for our customers driven by The European Accessibility Act (EAA). The program has 4 goals:,,,,,,,,,,Current compliance level,,,,,,source

,1,Identify the scope of compliance with the remaining 45 WCAG rules for HelloFresh and Factor on mobile.,,,,,,,,,WEB,,,,MOBILE,,

,2,"Ensure P90 compliance with 90% of WCAG rules on WEB and REACT NATIVE in all critical user journeys & pages with >1000 visits per month, by December 31, 2026.",,,,,,,,,33%,,,,15%,,

,3,Ensure each of the 55 WCAG rules that reached P90 compliance has at least one guard rail (either automated or manual).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,4,"Educate staff on the accessibility topic, including employees from Marketing, HR, and all stakeholders who create public pages and screens in EU markets, to ensure compliance for new content.",,,,,,,,,2025 compliance target,,,,,,source

,,,,,,,,,,,WEB,,,,MOBILE,,

,Background,,,,,,,,,,53%,,,,20%,,

,"The European Accessibility Act (EAA), which mandates that websites and mobile applications comply with WCAG 2.2 Level AA accessibility standards, will come into effect on June 28, 2025. The directive applies to all businesses in the EU, including HelloFresh. Non-compliance can result in penalties such as fines (ranging from 50K – 1M€) or, in some countries like Ireland, even prison sentences. Companies may also face legal action from disability advocacy groups.

Addressing accessibility compliance started in 2025. In September 2025, HelloTech agreed with Legal to reach 90% compliance by the end of 2026.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Key decisions ,,,,,,,,,,Upcoming milestones,,,,,,

,1,"Remediating the risk of fines requires a company-wide collaboration. Accessibility is a responsibility of each squad to support and include in their definition of done, while designers are the first gatekeepers. ",,,,,,,,,,HERE,,,,,

,2,Compliance translates into meeting 55 requirements from WCAG 2.2 accessibility standard. An overview and meaning of each rule could be found here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,3,"Web platform accessibility has a higher priority, compared to web, since it poses more risks from Legal perspective. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,4,Accessibility in mobile native code does not need to be supported due to a massive migration of screens to React Native.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Communication channels,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notes

* OTP Launch → decision: to have FF turn on in W02, but everything should be ready by EOY





Options

	Pros

	Cons

	Decision

	Launch W50

	More time before AD/ND

Time to iterate if issues

Time to rollout gradually





	Won’t make it! 

Less time for e2e testing

	No Go

	Launch W51 (To 90% of users)

	Original plan

On-track from dev pov

Captures business value earlier (~$15k in revenue)





	Super risky as most devs are out (Jordon, Jan, Edwin, Emily, Daniel, Travis)

Super close to EOY

Might break something on Factor

Not enough time for gradual rollout

On-calls: Emily Stanek (W50), Paul Andrews (W51/52)

	Maybe

	Launch W51 

(To only 10%)

	Mitigates the risk

Collects some feedback before the peak

	Still risky (Not enough devs to support)

Limited business impact





	No Go

	Launch W02

(To 90% of users)

	Less risky (Devs available for support)

Still before the actual peak

Won’t break anything on Factor/FF

	Delayed launch

Opportunity cost





	Go! 

	  W46 2024 - W04 2025 → The market is pretty soft over the last few weeks of the year

ckable only — no code).





Recruit 10–15 representative users (existing customers or target personas).





Ask them to choose between:





Current “build-your-own” flow





The new “plan-based” flow





Ask follow-ups:





Which feels more tailored to you?





Which would you trust more?





How likely are you to purchase?





✅ Advantages: Fast qualitative signal; surfaces objections early.

💡 Tip: Use Figma Analytics or Maze metrics (time on screen, clicks) for light quant data.





Option 3: “Fake Door” Test in Live Site





Goal: Measure real interest from actual users without building full functionality.





On your live PLP or homepage, add a new section or banner:





“Introducing our new lifestyle plans — Performance, Focus, and Foundation.”

CTA: “Explore Plans.”





When users click, send them to a “Coming Soon” page or a short survey:





“We’re launching soon — tell us which plan interests you most.”





Measure clicks, plan preference, and sign-ups for early access.





✅ Advantages: True behavioral data from live traffic.

💡 Tip: Works well if your current site already gets meaningful volume.





Option 4: Email or CRM Campaign Test





Goal: Validate resonance of messaging and pricing.





Segment your customer base (athletes, busy professionals, general wellness).





Send A/B email variants — one promoting current product set, one promoting “plans.”





Measure CTR, click-to-checkout, or pre-order intent.





✅ Advantages: Zero dev time, quick pulse check on messaging effectiveness.





📊 How to Evaluate Results

Metric        Signal        Success Criteria

CTR / engagement        Do users click into plan-based offers more than product-based ones?        +15–20% vs. baseline

Intent (survey or fake door)        Are users more likely to say they’d subscribe?        Majority (>60%) positive

AOV (simulated)        When choosing a plan, is average intended spend higher?        +10–15% lift

Qualitative sentiment        Do users say the plan feels easier, more relevant, or trustworthy?        Positive pattern emerges





If 2–3 of these indicators trend positively, that’s a green light to justify design + dev investment for a live experiment.





🚀 Recommended Next Step (Low-Effort, High-Insight)





Build a simple Figma prototype with your three plans + “Choose Plan” CTA, and test it via qualitative plan. (Option 2)

Notes[a]





Executive Summary (WIP)

The goal of this strategic phase was to evaluate the desirability for a new business opportunity in the B2B2C sector and get early signals before we start the experimental phase.

We’ve compiled research and insights with Food influencers (Hobbycooks – Chefs) and HelloFresh Prospects, fitting the profile segment of the Efficient Inspired and a high usage of social media for cooking and food content, to plan the vision and mvp path forward grounded in the needs and pains of our future customers and partners.

Overall, our research and user testing to date validates the interest and strategic value in providing for creators as well as customers (inspiration-execution gap).





Project Setup & Research Approach

Team Setup: The team was set up with one researcher (Kathreen Eckles) and one design strategist (Annette Meiser-von den Eichen) leading the work on research and strategic direction to understand desirability from influencer and customer, while parallel teams focused on viability, operational considerations, and technical feasibility. (Team Setup)





New Research Approach: We adopted an agile way of working, structuring the 9-week discovery into two-week sprints to enable fast learning and early validation. Instead of long, exhaustive research phases, we worked in short, focused cycles, running research and execution in parallel streams and continuously iterating on insights as they emerged. This allowed us to understand key assumptions earlier, quickly test and refine ideas, and share new findings on a weekly basis, ensuring ongoing alignment and informed decision-making throughout the project.

Summary





Nikita Gorshkov provided Samir and Allison with praise for the successful  

launch of the US factor form Shopify B2B store and discussed the technical  

requirements with Ian Brooks for replicating this store for a Canadian  

factor, including URL configuration and core infrastructure needs. They  

decided that the Canadian pilot should use static content and minimal  

initial integrations, estimating that the necessary work, including URL  

setup, some infrastructure, and basic tracking, would require one product  

resource and one engineering resource for about two weeks. Nikita Gorshkov  

suggested a B2B proof of concept with minimal integrations could cost less  

than $100k (USD) as a one-time charge from Anata, in addition to the  

$24,000 USD annual Shopify enterprise license fee, which Ian Brooks noted  

would significantly increase the pilot cost.





Suggested next steps





Nikita Gorshkov will prepare a decision tree with pros and cons to hash out  

the sequencing of the Creator platform versus the customer platform  

delivery during the January meeting.

Yes, you can yo-yo in space, and NASA already tried it.



Back in 2012, astronaut Don Pettit brought a yo-yo to the ISS and pulled off a whole routine in microgravity. 



Turns out the tricks still work because yo-yos rely on angular momentum, not “not floating away,” as long as you keep the string tight.

Summary





Laurent Guillemain introduced the one-year conversion rate program with  

multiple time-boxed initiatives aimed at achieving 2026 OKRs, with Dovas  

Zakas detailing the objective of a 25% year-on-year CVR improvement,  

focusing on dependable channels for tracking. Nikita Gorshkov emphasized a  

six-week short-term cadence for impetus, while Laurent Guillemain confirmed  

achievements would be measured through the quantifiable impact of delivered  

initiatives and a monthly ramp aligned with the OKR. Dovas Zakas, Laurent  

Guillemain, and Nikita Gorshkov agreed that Pratik would manage the  

conversion rate program for the first six months, focusing on initiatives  

across six pillars, with 20% of their time allocated to CVR and 20-30% to  

retention, requiring a technical owner from the engineering team to support  

them.





Suggested next steps





Nikita Gorshkov will have a discussion with Aron on Monday to figure out  

the actual capacity available.



Dovas Zakas will try to make the CVR tracking a bit more fair by looking at  

meta native or one of the search channels and track the 25% uplift on those  

channels.



Dovas Zakas will focus on the first draft of the tier co for the CVR  

program and make a monthly ramp to get to the goals.



Nikita Gorshkov will get back with the name of the technical owner for the  

CVR program.



Nikita Gorshkov will keep Dovas Zakas posted regarding the candidate for  

the analytics resource position.



Laurent Guillemain and Dovas Zakas will align offline on the content of  

slide three and slide six for the CVR program.

Summary





Laura Loughran welcomed Nikita Gorshkov back, and they discussed the recent  

Shopify launch, confirming that traffic strategy will be decided in January  

after analyzing conversion rates, and Nikita Gorshkov confirmed the OTP  

launch is still targeting the 5th, with a full end-to-end UAT scheduled for  

the 30th. Laura Loughran and Nikita Gorshkov raised concerns about the  

small team's capacity to manage both the new Shopify site and existing  

operations, agreeing that a dedicated Shopify team might be necessary to  

handle maintenance and questioning the future product ownership and  

strategy beyond basic maintenance, especially given team commitments like  

Samir and Alli (Allison) to other projects. Nikita Gorshkov also noted the  

team, including Hammed and Michael, is working on significantly improving  

the legacy integrated site, particularly the PDP pages.





Suggested next steps





Nikita Gorshkov will check Allison's schedule to confirm she will be  

available to support the Shopify site for the next couple of weeks.

Summary





Beatrice Dimarucut and Nikita Gorshkov discussed improving product imagery,  

testing refunds for one-time purchases, and increasing allocation for  

Christmas due to working ad tech tracking. They agreed to prioritize  

finishing upsells and new dashboards despite the potential increase in  

pause or cancellation rates from displaying future deliveries, as the  

expected rise in Average Order Value (AOV) should compensate. Beatrice  

Dimarucut set a tentative January 20th launch date for One-Time Purchase  

(OTP) and raised concerns about running the OTP allocation and price value  

funnel test concurrently due to potential result interpretation  

difficulties, deciding to consult with Ferron from PA. Nikita Gorshkov  

shared updates on an upcoming external CS5 role posting and announced their  

own promotion, which will involve supporting New Ventures, additional  

teams, and a planned B2B topic push.





Suggested next steps





Beatrice Dimarucut will properly plot out the calendar G sheet roadmap view  

for the 2026 initiative today.



Beatrice Dimarucut will ask for a data pool.



Beatrice Dimarucut will set up a call with Ferron to double check on  

running parallel experiments and discuss the specific case.

WWW.CLÄRCHENSBALL.HAUS























BERLIN,  DEZEMBER 2025















































































 

Am Sonntag, den 28. Dezember 2025, erwartet Euch im Clärchens ein außergewöhnliches Hörerlebnis: Die Violinistin Kamila Glass und die Cellistin Barbara Piotrowska musizieren seit ihrer Schulzeit 

gemeinsam. Zusammen mit der Pianistin Kim Barbier bilden sie das Trio Elan. 

 

Für ihr Konzert wählen die drei Musikerinnen Dvořáks berühmtes „Dumky-Trio“, eines der markantesten und populärsten Werke des Komponisten. Ergänzt wird das Programm durch bekannte Filmmusik, eigens 

für Klaviertrio arrangiert. Melodien aus großen Kino-Klassikern verbinden sich mit dem Klang der Kammermusik und schaffen ein reizvolles Zusammenspiel von Leinwandstimmung und musikalischer 

Feinheit. Mit dieser Mischung aus Emotion, Leichtigkeit und Eleganz passt das Konzert ideal in die festliche Zeit zwischen den Jahren.
