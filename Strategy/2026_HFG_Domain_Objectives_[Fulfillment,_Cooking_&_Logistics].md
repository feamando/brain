Fulfillment, Cooking & Logistics Domain 2026

Domain Objectives 

Our primary areas of investment proposed for 2026 are described below by priority. 





1. Objective: Deliver operational process and technology capabilities that enable unconstrained customer experience 

Measure of success:  Ensure capability to fulfill 500 meals is in place in mature BUs by W1 2027, with no mature BU having fewer than 200.
