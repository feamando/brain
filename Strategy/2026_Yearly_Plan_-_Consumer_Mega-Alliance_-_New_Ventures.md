Key Takeaways, Decisions, and Next Steps:

1. Alignment needed with Adam Park on plan for Factor Programs, as it fell below the line for Q4 and Q1. Does this need to be reprioritized? Done, we have agreed to keep momentum on physical product as well as planning ahead of Q2 development relaunch 

2. Factor Tech prioritization list created by Adam Park needs to be reviewed against the backlog of the MD squad. Done, we have reviewed the incremental asks, and have pulled them into Ed squad prioritization, and flagged items already in YP’s 

3. Lack of analytics resourcing was highlighted as risk for New Ventures, Annie and Jama to take away and come back with Analytics resourcing plans for New Ventures We have added 1 incremental PA resource to the New Ventures domain space, and will be looking to move additional temporary capacity to reduce the outstanding backlog 

4. Factor Form should better connect their products to customers  goals to create a “personalized performance stack”. Jama to connect with Adam Park on this plan We have added this for exploration in Q3 plan 

5. An aligned strategy should be created on how Loyalty should work for the New Ventures, and should this connect to the New Loyalty strategy set to launch in Q2-Q3 We will be looking to leverage the New Loyalty program when it launches, so we have therefore moved loyalty for Pets Table back by 1 quarter into Q3   

6. Cross Selling for other brands outside of HelloFresh and Factor is below the line for 2026 to be revisited for 2027 planning
