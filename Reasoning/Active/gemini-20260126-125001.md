# FPF Reasoning Session

**Question:** Challenge TKS mathematical foundations: (1) Is spreading activation A_t(e) = (1-d)A_{t-1}(e) + d·Σw·A_{t-1}(neighbors) computationally tractable for large graphs? (2) Is convergence-weighted multipoint aggregation A_S(e) = (Σᵢ A^{(sᵢ)}(e))·C(e)^γ theoretically justified? (3) Is the confidence formula confidence = κ^α·(1-e^{-|N|/β})·(1-e^{-density/γ}) for constructive retrieval well-founded? (4) Is fractal dimension D_f = -lim log(N(θ))/log(θ) measurable in practice? (5) Is dual coding R(e) = ρ_v(e) ⊕ ρ_i(e) meaningful or just concatenation? (6) What mathematical gaps or errors exist?
