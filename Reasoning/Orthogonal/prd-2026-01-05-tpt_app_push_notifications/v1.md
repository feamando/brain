## 1. Purpose

### What This Document Proposes

This PRD defines the push notification and engagement features for The Pets Table (TPT) mobile app v1, designed to drive Active Order Rate (AOR) lift through timely, personalized notifications that keep pet parents engaged with their subscription.

### Why It Matters Now

1. **Revenue Impact**: Projected ~$1.5M incremental revenue via +5% AOR lift from notifications
2. **App v1 Milestone**: Push notifications are a core unlock for the v1 "Engagement & Revenue" phase
3. **Competitive Pressure**: Pet food competitors (Farmer's Dog, Ollie) have mature mobile experiences
4. **Technical Readiness**: React Native shell architecture is in place; notification infrastructure is the next logical step

### FPF Context

- **Assurance Level Target**: L2 Verified
- **Key Hypothesis**: Push notifications will drive measurable AOR improvement through delivery reminders and engagement triggers

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Core Problem

> TPT customers currently have no proactive communication channel that drives them back to the app/website outside of email. This results in missed engagement opportunities, forgotten deliveries, and preventable churn.

### Evidence

| Source | Finding | Confidence |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Internal Analytics | Email open rates ~20-25%; push notification industry average 5-7% open rate but higher engagement | High |
| Customer Support | Top inquiry: "When is my next delivery?" | High |
| Competitor Analysis | Farmer's Dog, Ollie have push-enabled apps | Medium |
| 2026 BP | App launch identified as key growth lever | High |

### Impact Quantification

- **Current State**: No push notifications; reliance on email for all customer communication
- **Lost Engagement**: Estimated 30% of customers forget delivery dates
- **Churn Risk**: Customers who miss a delivery window are 2x more likely to pause/cancel

### Why Now?

1. **v0 POC Complete**: Webview wrapper validated; now ready for native features
2. **2026 Business Plan**: App is a key initiative with exec sponsorship
3. **Technical Infrastructure**: Push notification services (FCM/APNs) are well-established
4. **Prateek Onboarded**: New Staff PM to drive execution

---

## 3. Solution

### Hypothesis

> If we implement push notifications for delivery reminders, order updates, and engagement triggers, then we will see a +5% AOR lift and reduced support inquiries about delivery timing, because pet parents will have timely, actionable information at their fingertips.

### Proposed Approach

Implement a three-tier notification system:

1. **Transactional Notifications** (Must Have)
   - Delivery scheduled
   - Delivery out for delivery
   - Delivery completed
   - Payment processed
   - Order confirmation

2. **Engagement Notifications** (Should Have)
   - Delivery reminder (24h before)
   - Skip deadline reminder
   - Menu available for selection
   - Plan renewal reminder

3. **Personalization Notifications** (Could Have)
   - Pet birthday reminders
   - Feeding tips based on pet profile
   - New recipe alerts matching pet preferences
   - Milestone celebrations (100th meal, etc.)

### Key Features (MVP)

| Feature | Description | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Push Permission Flow | In-app prompt to enable notifications | Must |
| Delivery Notifications | Order status updates (scheduled, shipped, delivered) | Must |
| Notification Preferences | Settings screen to manage notification types | Must |
| Deep Linking | Tap notification → relevant app screen | Must |
| Skip/Edit Reminder | 24h before skip deadline notification | Should |
| Menu Selection Alert | New menu available for selection | Should |
| Analytics Integration | Track notification engagement (sent, opened, converted) | Should |
| Pet Birthday Alerts | Personalized birthday messages | Could |
| Feeding Tips | Contextual pet care tips | Could |

### What This Is NOT

- **Not a chat/messaging system**: No two-way communication in v1
- **Not marketing automation**: Not replacing email campaigns
- **Not a standalone notification platform**: Integrated with existing backend
- **Not iOS/Android parity immediately**: May prioritize one platform for MVP

---

## 4. Business Impact

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Timeframe |
|--------|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Primary: AOR Lift** | 0% (no app) | +5% | 6 months post-launch |
| Push Opt-in Rate | N/A | >60% | 3 months post-launch |
| Notification Open Rate | N/A | >15% | 3 months post-launch |
| Support Tickets (Delivery) | 100/week | -25% | 6 months post-launch |

### Revenue Projection

- **Base Revenue Impact**: $1.5M incremental (from 2026 BP)
- **Assumptions**:
  - 5% AOR improvement across active base
  - 60% push opt-in rate
  - 40% of opt-ins receive actionable notifications weekly

### Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Low opt-in rate | Reduced impact | Medium | Compelling value prop in permission flow |
| Notification fatigue | User churn | Medium | Smart frequency capping, user controls |
| Technical complexity | Delays | Low | Use established push infrastructure |
| Cross-platform issues | User experience gaps | Medium | Prioritize single platform MVP |

## 5. Technical Strategy

### Dependencies

| Dependency | Owner | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| React Native shell | Client Platform | Complete |
| FCM/APNs integration | Mobile Team | Not Started |
| Backend event system | NV Backend | Partial |
| Deep linking framework | Mobile Team | Not Started |

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Foundation (4 weeks)**
- Push permission flow
- FCM/APNs integration
- Device token management
- Basic transactional notifications (delivery status)

**Phase 2: Engagement (3 weeks)**
- Skip deadline reminders
- Menu selection alerts
- Notification preferences UI

**Phase 3: Personalization (3 weeks)**
- Pet birthday notifications
- Feeding tips
- Analytics dashboard

### Technical Decisions (FPF Evaluated)

| Decision | Options | Selected | Rationale |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------|
| Push Provider | FCM only / APNs only / Both | Both | Required for iOS + Android coverage |
| Notification Service | Build vs Buy | Buy (Firebase) | Faster time-to-market, proven scale |
| Deep Linking | Native vs React Navigation | React Navigation | Consistency with webview architecture |

## 7. FPF Reasoning Log

### Hypotheses Evaluated

1. **H1: Push notifications will drive AOR improvement**
   - Status: Primary hypothesis
   - Evidence: Industry benchmarks, competitor analysis
   - Confidence: L1 Substantiated (pending validation with TPT data)

2. **H2: Webview-first approach is sufficient for v1**
   - Status: Validated
   - Evidence: v0 POC successful
   - Confidence: L2 Verified

3. **H3: Pet parents want proactive delivery communication**
   - Status: Supported
   - Evidence: Customer support data, industry research
   - Confidence: L1 Substantiated

### Evidence Chain

1. **2026 Business Plan** - App launch as key initiative - CL: 0.9, Weight: 0.3
2. **Customer Support Data** - Delivery inquiries are top ticket type - CL: 0.8, Weight: 0.25
3. **Competitor Analysis** - Farmer's Dog, Ollie have push-enabled apps - CL: 0.7, Weight: 0.2
4. **Industry Benchmarks** - Push notification effectiveness data - CL: 0.6, Weight: 0.15
5. **v0 POC Results** - Webview wrapper validated - CL: 0.9, Weight: 0.1

### Assumptions Requiring Validation

- [ ] TPT customers will opt-in to push at >60% rate
- [ ] Push notifications will not cannibalize email engagement
- [ ] Backend event system can support real-time notification triggers
- [ ] React Native push integration is straightforward with current architecture

## 8. Open Questions

1. **iOS vs Android Priority**: Should we launch on both platforms simultaneously or prioritize one?
2. **Notification Frequency**: What is the optimal cadence to avoid fatigue?
3. **Personalization Depth**: How much pet-specific data should inform notifications in v1?
4. **A/B Testing Strategy**: How will we measure notification effectiveness?
