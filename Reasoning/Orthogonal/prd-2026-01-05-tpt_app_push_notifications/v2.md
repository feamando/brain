# Challenger Review: TPT Mobile App - Push Notifications

*Round 2 - Challenger (Gemini Perspective)*
*Generated: 2026-01-05T13:40:00*

---

## Executive Summary of Challenges

The v1 PRD presents a reasonable case for push notifications but has several critical gaps that could undermine success:

1. **Unvalidated Core Assumption**: The 5% AOR lift projection lacks TPT-specific evidence
2. **Missing User Research**: No customer validation of notification preferences
3. **Incomplete Cost-Benefit**: Development costs not weighed against $1.5M projection
4. **Platform Strategy Gap**: iOS vs Android decision deferred but critical for ROI
5. **Measurement Framework Weak**: Success metrics lack statistical rigor

---

## Detailed Challenges

### Challenge 1: Revenue Projection Lacks TPT-Specific Validation
**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Issue:** The $1.5M incremental revenue and 5% AOR lift are stated as facts but traced only to "2026 BP" without TPT-specific evidence.

**Why It Matters:**
- Industry benchmarks for push notification effectiveness vary wildly (2-15% engagement)
- Pet food subscription behavior may differ from meal kit patterns
- No A/B test or pilot data supports these projections

**Questions:**
- What is the current AOR for TPT customers?
- How was the 5% lift calculated?
- What is the confidence interval on $1.5M projection?

**Recommended Change:**
Add sensitivity analysis showing scenarios: pessimistic (2% lift), expected (5% lift), optimistic (8% lift) with corresponding revenue impact.

---

### Challenge 2: Missing Customer Research
**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Issue:** No customer interviews, surveys, or usability testing validate that TPT customers want push notifications.

**Why It Matters:**
- Pet parents may have different app engagement patterns than meal kit customers
- Notification fatigue is a real risk without understanding preferences
- The permission flow design lacks customer input

**Questions:**
- Have any TPT customers been asked about notification preferences?
- What do customers currently do to track deliveries?
- What is the email engagement rate for delivery-related emails?

**Recommended Change:**
Conduct 10-15 customer interviews before finalizing notification types. Add findings to Evidence Chain.

---

### Challenge 3: Incomplete Total Cost of Ownership
**Severity: MAJOR**

**Issue:** No development cost estimate provided to validate ROI.

**Why It Matters:**
- 10 weeks of engineering time has significant cost
- Push infrastructure has ongoing operational costs
- Without cost, $1.5M revenue is meaningless for decision-making

**Questions:**
- What is the estimated engineering effort in person-weeks?
- What are the ongoing costs for FCM/APNs?
- What is the expected payback period?

**Recommended Change:**
Add section: "Investment Required" with engineering effort, infrastructure costs, and ROI calculation.

---

### Challenge 4: Platform Prioritization Deferred
**Severity: MAJOR**

**Issue:** "May prioritize one platform for MVP" but no guidance on which or why.

**Why It Matters:**
- iOS and Android have different push implementations
- TPT customer base may skew heavily to one platform
- Resource allocation depends on this decision

**Questions:**
- What is the iOS vs Android split for TPT web traffic?
- Which platform has higher value customers?
- What is the effort delta between iOS-first vs Android-first?

**Recommended Change:**
Make explicit platform recommendation based on user data, or document decision criteria.

---

### Challenge 5: Notification Fatigue Risk Under-addressed
**Severity: MAJOR**

**Issue:** "Smart frequency capping, user controls" mentioned as mitigation but not specified.

**Why It Matters:**
- Over-notification is the #1 cause of push opt-out
- Pet food is weekly/bi-weekly; over-notification feels excessive
- No specific caps or rules proposed

**Questions:**
- What is the maximum notifications per week?
- How will we detect notification fatigue?
- What is the unsubscribe recovery strategy?

**Recommended Change:**
Define specific frequency caps: e.g., "Max 3 notifications per week, never more than 1 per day"

---

### Challenge 6: Deep Linking Complexity Underestimated
**Severity: MINOR**

**Issue:** "React Navigation" selected for deep linking but webview-first architecture may complicate this.

**Why It Matters:**
- Deep linking into webviews requires URL scheme coordination
- Edge cases (app not installed, expired links) not addressed
- Testing complexity increases

**Questions:**
- How do deep links work when app is not installed?
- What happens if deep link target is in webview vs native?
- Who owns the URL scheme?

**Recommended Change:**
Add technical spike for deep linking as explicit pre-requisite before Phase 1.

---

### Challenge 7: Success Metrics Lack Statistical Rigor
**Severity: MINOR**

**Issue:** Metrics listed but no methodology for measurement.

**Why It Matters:**
- "AOR Lift" of 5% needs control group to validate
- Attribution of lift to push notifications vs other factors unclear
- Timeline of "6 months" may be too long to course-correct

**Questions:**
- Will there be a holdout group for measurement?
- How will we isolate push notification impact from other initiatives?
- What is the minimum detectable effect with current user base?

**Recommended Change:**
Add "Measurement Plan" section with A/B test design, statistical power analysis.

---

### Challenge 8: Alternative Not Considered - SMS
**Severity: MINOR**

**Issue:** Push notifications assumed as solution; SMS not evaluated.

**Why It Matters:**
- SMS has higher open rates than push (98% vs 5-7%)
- SMS doesn't require app installation
- Many customers may not install the app

**Questions:**
- What percentage of customers would install the app?
- What is the cost comparison of SMS vs Push?
- Could SMS be a complementary channel?

**Recommended Change:**
Add SMS as alternative considered with pros/cons analysis.

---

## Alternative Proposals

### Alternative A: SMS-First with Push as Upgrade
Instead of app-first push notifications, launch SMS delivery notifications immediately (no app required), then migrate engaged users to push as app adoption grows.

**Pros:**
- Faster time-to-value (no app development)
- Higher reach (all customers, not just app users)
- Lower technical complexity

**Cons:**
- Ongoing SMS costs
- Less rich notification experience
- Doesn't drive app adoption

### Alternative B: Phased Rollout with Validation Gates
Before building Phase 2 & 3, require Phase 1 to hit minimum metrics:
- Push opt-in >50%
- Notification open rate >10%
- No increase in support tickets about notification issues

If gates not met, pivot or pause investment.

**Pros:**
- Reduces risk of building features nobody uses
- Creates learning loops
- Allows resource reallocation if needed

**Cons:**
- Slower to full feature set
- May frustrate stakeholders wanting complete solution

| # | Challenge | Severity | Recommendation |
|---|-----------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Revenue projection | Critical | Add sensitivity analysis |
| 2 | Missing customer research | Critical | Conduct 10-15 interviews |
| 3 | No cost estimate | Major | Add Investment Required section |
| 4 | Platform not decided | Major | Make explicit recommendation |
| 5 | Notification fatigue | Major | Define specific frequency caps |
| 6 | Deep linking complexity | Minor | Add technical spike |
| 7 | Metrics lack rigor | Minor | Add measurement plan |
| 8 | SMS not considered | Minor | Add alternatives analysis |

## Round 2 FPF Assessment

### Challenger's Assurance Evaluation

- **Original Claim**: Push notifications will drive +5% AOR and $1.5M revenue
- **Challenger Assurance**: **L0 Hypothetical** → Lacks TPT-specific validation
- **Path to L1**: Customer research + pilot data
- **Path to L2**: A/B test with statistically significant results

### Bias Detection

1. **Confirmation Bias**: PRD assumes push is the right solution without evaluating SMS or other channels
2. **Optimism Bias**: 5% AOR lift is optimistic without supporting data
3. **Sunk Cost Risk**: v0 webview investment may be driving push-forward mentality
