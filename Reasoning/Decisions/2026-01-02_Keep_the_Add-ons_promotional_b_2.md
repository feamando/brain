# Decision: Keep the Add-ons promotional banner

**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Source:** GDocs - PRD: TPT Sign-up Page Revamp
**Confidence:** medium


## Decision

Keep the Add-ons promotional banner

## Participants

Product team

## Context

Two experiments with seasonal promotional banners in similar location resulted in positive CVR improvements. Customers learn about Add-ons for first time on sign-up page and create intent to buy during checkout. Team lacks experimental bandwidth for testing alternatives.
