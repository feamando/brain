**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Source:** GDocs - PRD: Sign up page revamp
**Confidence:** medium


## Decision

Keep the Add-ons promotional banner

## Context

Two experiments with seasonal promotional banners in similar location showed positive CVR improvements. Customers learn about Add-ons for first time on sign up page. Team lacks experimental bandwidth to test alternatives.
