## Decision

OTP Launch to have FF turn on in W02, everything ready by EOY

## Participants

Unknown

## Context

Evaluated multiple launch options (W50, W51 at 90%, W51 at 10%, W02). Chose W02 launch to 90% of users as less risky with devs available for support, still before peak, won't break Factor/FF. Rejected earlier launches due to developer availability during holidays and risk factors.
