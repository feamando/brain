## Decision

CVA tracking should be based on actual Statsig results applied to baseline numbers, not business case projections

## Participants

U03TY4YJU4X, U01AKGWGLC8, U07VDFEFBQU

## Context

Clarifying methodology after confusion about whether CVA values should use business case estimates or actual experimental results. Team agreed to duplicate BC and add 'Results' suffix to track estimations vs actuals.
