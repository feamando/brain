**Confidence:** medium


## Decision

Defer Zest UI2 adoption completion until brand refresh in second half of 2026

## Participants

UEZ4PRFKM, U01AKGWGLC8

## Context

~60 files still need updates per brand; external agency brand refresh won't kick off until second part of 2026, so Zest migration should align with that effort
