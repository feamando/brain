## Decision

OTP Launch to be feature-flagged and turned on in W02 (Week 2), with everything ready by end of year

## Participants

Unknown

## Context

Evaluated multiple launch options (W50, W51 at 90%, W51 at 10%, W02). Chose W02 launch to 90% of users as less risky with dev support available, still before peak season, and won't break Factor/FF. Rejected earlier launches due to lack of dev support during holidays and risk to Factor.
