**Date:** 2026-01-02

## Decision

Push OTP full launch to Monday of week two instead of week 51

## Participants

Unknown

## Context

Mitigate risks associated with limited team bandwidth, outstanding items in week 51, and proximity to year-end dates. Week one would still see low traffic due to calendar year.
