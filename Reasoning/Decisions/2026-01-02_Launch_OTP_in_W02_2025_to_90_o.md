# Decision: Launch OTP in W02 2025 to 90% of users

**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Source:** GDocs - Factor Form Weekly Tech - Business Sync
**Confidence:** medium


## Decision

Launch OTP in W02 2025 to 90% of users

## Participants

Hamed Karimian, Laura Loughran, Amy Cheong

## Context

Decided against W50 and W51 launches due to developer availability risks during holidays and proximity to end of year. W02 is less risky with devs available for support and still before actual peak season
