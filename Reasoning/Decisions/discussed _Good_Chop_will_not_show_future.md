## Decision

Good Chop will not show future deliveries beyond next box until Q2 2026 dashboard release

## Participants

Testing showed future box display led to increased Cancellations and Pauses, making it CVA negative. Also limited by legacy Whitelabel dashboard constraints and strategic pivot to e-commerce model
